      "text": "- It was just like one of those moments where we saw it at the same time. And we were standing by the tail, and the snake was so big that, I mean, this must have been a\n25-foot anaconda dead asleep, with a probably a 16-foot\nanaconda sprawled across her. And they're laying in the starlight and we're floating on top of a lake, standing there in the\nmiddle of the Amazon. And JJ just, I could feel the\nblood drain outta his face. And as like a however old I was, you know, maybe 20 years old. I just said if we could\nsomehow show people this, we'll be on the front cover\nin National Geographic and we can protect all\nthe jungle that we want. And so I tried to catch it. Yeah, so I jumped on the snake, and the only measurement\nI have of this animal is that when I wrapped my arms around it, I couldn't touch my fingers. And so I was, you know,\nmy feet were dragging. And to her credit, this anaconda did not turn around and eat me, 'cause her head was, you know, this big. And she went and she reached\nthe edge of the grass island and she starts plunging into the dark. And so I'm watching the stars vibrate as this anaconda is going, and I had to make the choice\nof either going head first down into the black, which, no thank you, or stopping and just keeping\nmy hand on this thing as it raced by me. And I just felt the scales\nand the muscle and the power go by and then eventually\ntaper down to the tail until it slipped away into the darkness. And I was laying there, just panting. - The following is a\nconversation with Paul Rosalie, a conservationist,\nexplorer, author, filmmaker, and real life Tarzan. Since, for much of the past 17 years, Paul has lived deep in\nthe Amazon rainforest protecting endangered species\nand trees from poachers, loggers and foreign nations funding them. He is the founder of Junglekeepers, which today protects over 50,000 acres of threatened habitat. And Paul is one of the most incredible human beings I've ever met. I hope to travel with him in\nthe Amazon jungle one day, because in his eyes, I saw a truth that can only be discovered\ndirectly by spending time among the immensity and power\nof nature at its purest. This is Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Paul Rosolie."

      "text": "In 2006, at 18 years old, you fled New York and\ntraveled to the Amazon. This started a journey that\nI think last to this day. Tell me about this first leap. What in your heart pulled you\ntowards the Amazon jungle? - From the time I was, you\nknow, three years old, I'd say, you know, it was dinosaurs,\nwildlife documentary, Steve Irwin, you name it. And when my parents said, you know, nature versus nurture,\nthey nurtured my nature. I was always just drawn\nto streams, forests, I wanted to go explore\nwhere the little creek led, I wanted to see the\nturtles and the snakes. And so I was a kid that hated school, did not get along with school. I was dyslexic and didn't\nknow it, undiagnosed, I didn't read until I\nwas like 10 years old, like, way behind. And so for me, the forest was safety. Like, I remember one time in first grade they had you doing those\nmultiplication sheets. That was pure hell for me. And so I actually got so\nupset that I couldn't do it, that I ran out the\nclassroom, ran out the door, and went to the nearest woods and I stayed there 'cause that was safe. And so for me, once I got to\nthe point where I was like, high school isn't working out, I had incredibly supportive\nparents that were like, \"Look, just get out. Take your GED, get outta\nhigh school after 10th grade. You gotta go to college, but start doing something you love.\" And so I saved up and bought\na ticket to the Amazon and met some indigenous guys. The second I walked in\nthat forest, it was like, it's like the first\nscene in \"Jurassic Park\" when they see the dinosaurs\nand they go, oh, this is it. I walked in there and just, I looked at those giant trees, I saw leafcutter ants in real\nlife, and I just went, \"Oh.\" It was like the movie\njust started, you know, that was when I came online. - Can you put into words what is it about that place that felt like home?\nWhat was it that drew you? What aspect of nature?\nThe streams, the water, the forest, the jungle, the animals, what drew you? - It's just, it's always been in my blood. I mean, for any forest, I mean, whether it's upstate\nNew York or India or Borneo. But the Amazon, it's all of\nthat turned up to this level where everything is superlatively diverse. You know, you have more plants and animals than anywhere else on earth. Not just now, but in the\nentire fossil record. The Andes Amazon interface, terrestrially, that's where it is. That's the greatest library\nof life that has ever existed. And so you're so stimulated, you're so overwhelmed with\ncolor and diversity and beauty and this overwhelming sense\nof natural majesty of these, you know, thousand-year-old trees, and half the life is up in\nthe canopy of those trees. We don't even have access to it, there's stuff without names\nwalking around on those branches and it's like, it just\ntakes you somewhere. And so going there, it was like, you know, the guys I met just opened\nthe door and they were like, how far do you wanna go\ndown the rabbit hole? How much of this do you want to see? - You mentioned Steve Irwin. You list a bunch of heroes that\nyou have, he's one of them. And you said that when you're\nunsure about a decision, you ask yourself, WWSD,\nwhat would Steve do? Why is that such a good\nheuristic for life, what would Steve do? - He's a human being that, like, everything we saw from\nSteve Irwin was positive. Everything was with a smile on his face. If he was getting bitten\nby a reticulated python, he was smiling. If he was getting destroyed in the news for feeding a crocodile\nwith his son too close, he was trying to explain\nto people why it's okay and why we have to love these animals. And everything was about love, everything was about, you\nknow, wildlife and protecting. And to me, a person like that, that where you only see positive things, that's a role model. - And it's just like an endless curiosity and hunger to explore\nthis world of nature. - Yeah, and an insatiable\nmadness for wildlife. I mean, the guy was just so much fun. - I gotta, if it's okay, read to you a few of your own words. You open (chuckles)\n- [Paul] Oh boy. - the book \"Mother of God\" with a passage that I think beautifully paints a scene. Before he died, Santiago\nDurand told me a secret. It was late at night\nin a palm-thatched hut on a bank of the Tambopata River, deep in the southwestern\ncorner of the Amazon Basin. Besides a mud oven, two\nwild boar heads sizzling, sizzled in a cradle of embers, their protruding tusks\ncurling in static agony as they cooked. The smell of burning cecropia wood and singed flesh filled the air. Woven basket containing monkey\nskulls hung from the rafters where stars peeked through\nthe gaps in the thatching. A pair of chickens huddled in\nthe corner, conversing softly. We sat facing each\nother on sturdy benches, across a table hewn from\na single cross section of some massive tree, now\nnearly consumed by termites. The song of a million insects\nand frogs filled the night. Santiago's cigarette\ntrembled in the aged fingers as he leaned close over the candlelight to describe a place hidden in the jungle. That line, the songs of a million insects and frogs filled the night,\nfor some reason hit me. What's it like sitting\nthere conversing among so many living creatures all around you? - Every night in the jungle, you live in constant awareness of that, out there in the darkness\nare literally millions of heartbeats around you. And so, like, we exist in this, you know, domesticated,\npaved world most of the time. But when you go out there past the roads and the telephone poles and the hospitals, and you make it out into earth, just wild earth and there's no, you know, it's not like this is a national park, there's no rescue helicopter\nwaiting to come get you, you are out there and you're\nsurrounded at night by, I mean, there are snakes and\njaguars and frogs and insects, and all this stuff just\ncrawling through the swamps and through the trees\nand through the branches. We put on headlamps and\ngo out into the night and just absolutely fall\nto our knees with wonder of the things that we see, it's absolutely incredible. - And most of it doesn't make\nsounds like the insects do. - The insects do, the frogs do, you have some of the\nnight birds making sounds, but a lot of it, everything has evolved\nto be silent, invisible. I mean, everything there is on the list. There's another line in \"Mother\nof God\" where I said like, you know, life is just like\na temporary moment of stasis and like the churning\nrecycling death march that is the Amazon like. It's been called the greatest\nnatural battlefield on earth. I mean, in any square acre, there's more stuff eating other\nthings than anywhere else. And you go through a swamp in\nthe Amazon and there's like, there's tarantulas floating on the water, there's frogs in the trees, there's tadpoles hanging from leaves waiting to drop into the water, there's fish waiting to eat them, there's birds in the trees. You literally are\nsurrounded by so many things that your brain can't process it. It's just overwhelming life. - Churning death march. Some of the creatures are waiting and some of them are being a\nbit more proactive about it. What do you make of that\nchurning death march, the amount of murder that's\nhappening all around you at all scales? What is that? You know, we dramatize wars and the millions of people\nthat were lost in World War II, some of them tortured, some of them dying with a gun in hand, some of them civilians, but\nit's just millions of people. What about the billions and billions and billions of organisms\nthat are just being murdered all around you? Does that change your view of nature, of life here? - I've always kind of wondered like that when you see like a\nwildebeest taken down by lions and eaten from behind while it's alive and it makes you question God. You know, you go, how\ncould they let this happen? In the Amazon, I find personally that these natural processes\nmake up almost a religion, that it reminds you how temporary we are, that, you know, the botflies that are trying to get into your skin and the mosquitoes that are\ntrying to suck your blood. When you sweat, you see the, you literally can like hold out your arm and watch the condensation\ncome off of your skin and rise up into the\ncanopy and join the clouds and rain back down in the afternoon, and then you drink the river\nand start it all over again. And it's like, it's flowing through you. So the Amazon reminds me that there's a lot that we don't understand. And so when it comes to that overwhelming and collective murder,\nas Werner Herzog put it, it's just part of the show, it's part of the freak show\nof the Amazonian night. - I see you in certain moments able to feel one with a mosquito that's trying to kill you slowly. - One with the mosquito is a stretch. - Is it always the enemy? What I mean is, like, you're part of the machine there, right? - Yeah, and it's like fair play. It's like fair play. So we have bullet ants and you know, you get nailed by a bullet\nant, and you just go. - Yeah, well done. Well done. - Yeah, today's over, I'm going back to bed and\nI'm taking a pile of Tylenol. - Do you think in that\nsense, when you're out there, are you a part of nature or\nare you separate from nature? Is man a part of nature or separate? - I think that's what's\nso refreshing about it, is that out there you truly are. And so whether we're bringing\nresearchers or film crews, or whether we're just out there\nourselves on an expedition, you truly are a part of nature. And so one of the things that\nmy team and I started doing when I became friends with these guys, this is a family of indigenous people from the community of\nInfierno and they took me in. And as we got close, they\nstarted saying, you know, you can come with us on\nour annual hunting trip. And I went okay. And it's four guys in a boat, and you don't wanna get your clothes wet, so we're all in our boxers\nin a canoe with a motor going out past the places that have names, and you're out in the\nmiddle of the jungle. And the thing is like\nwhen your motor breaks, you are so quickly reminded of the inherent truths, like the things that\nnobody can argue with. And we live in such a human world where everything is debatable, religion and politics and\nperspectives on everything. And then you get down to\nthis point where it's like, if we don't figure something out, the river is going to\nrise and take the boat. That's the truth, and ain't nobody gonna\nlike argue with that. And it's like, to me there's\na beauty in that truth because then all of us are\nunited there in that truth against like the natural facts around us. And so to me, that's a state where I\nfeel very, very at home. - And the Amazon is more efficient\nthan most places on earth at swallowing you up. - Oh God, yeah.\n- Okay. (both chuckles)"

      "section": "Discovery of the Amazon",
      "text": "So just to linger on that because you've spoken about\nFrancisco de Orellana, who's this explorer in 1541 and 42 that sailed the length of the Amazon, probably one of the first. And there's just a few things\nI should probably read. I should probably find a good book on him because the guy seems like a gangster. - [Paul] Yes, there's\nsome great books on him. - So he sailed, he led the expedition\nthat sailed all the way from one end to the other, there's like a rebuilding of a ship. - [Paul] Which is insanity. - Yeah. So because it speaks to the thing, it's like nobody's gonna come\nand rescue you, you have to. If your boat dies, you\ngotta have to rebuild it. - Yeah, so they came down the Andes, entered in the headwaters of the Amazon, constructed some sort of\nraft boat, craft something, and made it down the entire Amazon Basin. Of course his stories are the ones that led to the Amazon\nbeing called the Amazon because he reported tribes of women, he reported these large cities, places where the tribes lived\non farms of river turtles that they corralled and they\nlived off of that protein. And then when they came out\nto the mouth of the Amazon, if I remember it correctly, that just through\nnavigation and the stars, they were able to calculate\nwhere the way was back to Spain and make a boat seaworthy\nenough to bring them home. Incredible. Absolutely. - Do people like that inspire\nyou, your own journey? Like, what gives you kind of strength that in these harshness of times and harshness of conditions\nyou can persevere? - Yeah, I mean, you look\nat the stories of people that are so, you know, these stories of people that have overcome incredible suffering like\nthat or like, you know, what Shackleton did or\nsomething like that. And so like when your, you know, your tent gets washed away, you go to sleep and\nthe river rises 20 feet and washes away your tent. And you crawl out and\nall you have is a machete and a headlamp, literally\nno bag, no food, no nothing. And you go, wow, the next six days before I reach back to a town\nis gonna be just pure hell. I'm gonna be sleeping on\nthe ground covered in ants, destroyed by mosquitoes. And then it becomes, you\nknow, am I in any capacity, any percentage as tough\nand resilient as the people that I've read about that\nhave made it through things far worse than this? And then that's the game you play. - What goes through your head when all you got is the\nheadlamp and the machete? So are you thinking at all? Like, I've gotten a chance to interact quite a lot with Elon Musk and he constantly puts out fires having to run several companies. There's never a kind of whiny\ndeliberation about issues, you're just always one\nstep forward how to solve, this is the situation,\nhow do you solve it. Or do you also have a\nkind of self-motivating, almost egotistical, like,\nI'm a bad motherfucker, I can handle anything, almost like trying to fake it till you make it kind of thing? - There was a little bit of that. - [Lex] With your machete in the hand. - I got a sword. There may may have been\na little bit of that when I was like 14, 15 years old, I'd like have a hunting knife and my dog and I'd go out into the\nwoods in like the Catskills and survive for a weekend, which my rule was one match. You know, you get one match\nand you gotta make shelter and then, I'd bring like a steak and make a fire and stuff. And at that point there\nmaybe was some ego, but in the Amazon you get stripped down so completely that you, it's like that thing like, you know, watch the atheism leave everyone's body when they think they're about to die. It's like when you find yourself staring up at the Amazon\nat night and you go there is no hope of getting outta here. I mean, I was once lost in a\nswamp where it took me days to get out of there. And there was moments where I just said, you know, this is clearly it. There's no ego there, there's just hope. You start realizing what you believe in, and praying that you'll be okay, and then trying to summon\nwhatever you know about how to survive, and that's it. And so it's actually, again, it's kind of a blissful state if you can walk that line\nbetween adventure and tragedy and sort of keep yourself right\nat that very, very fine line without going over. - Ever fear of death? Ever fear, terror? - No, I don't want to die. I wanna, you know, I love the people in my life and there's a lot of things I want to do, but every time I've been\ncertain that I'm gonna die, I've been very, very calm. Very calm, and just sort of like, okay, well if this is how the movie goes then this is how it goes. - [Lex] Almost accepting.\n- Yeah. Which is reassuring."

      "section": "Werner Herzog",
      "text": "- You've mentioned Herzog, just to venture down this road\nof death and fear and so on. There's been a few mad men\nlike you in this world, he's documented a couple of them. What lessons do you\ndraw from \"Grizzly Man\" or \"Into The Wild,\"\nthose kinds of stories? Were you ever afraid that\nyou'll be one of those stories? - Oh yeah. I actually think\nthat it's in \"Mother of God\" where I said I almost\n\"Into The Wild\"ed myself. Like, I went out there and really, I got so lost and so destroyed that I said this is gonna be the next one. You know, this is gonna be the\nnext story of some idiot kid from New York who went to the Amazon thinking he was Percy\nFawcett and then vanished. Because if you do vanish out there, your body's gonna be\nconsumed in a matter of days, like, two. If we see an animal dead on a trail, you got dung beatles and\nfly larva and vultures, and there's a whole pecking order, you know, you get the black vultures, the yellow vultures, the king\nvulture, they all come in. That thing is picked\nclean in a couple of days. - What would be the creature\nthat eats most of you in that situation? - Probably the vultures.\n- [Lex] The vultures? - Probably the vultures and the maggots. It's really quick. It's really, really quick. Even as far as like you\ncan't leave food out, you know, like if you\nhave a piece of chicken, you say, \"Oh, I'll eat it in\nthe morning,\" you leave it out. You can't do that, it's\nnot good by morning. - \"Grizzly Man\" for example, like what? 'Cause that's a beautiful story. It's both comical and genius, and especially the way Herzog tells it. Well, first do you like\nthe way he told the story? Do you like Herzog? - I do. I love Herzog, and\nI love his documentary, the \"Burden of Dreams,\" which is in the Amazon not\nvery far from where I work. And the sheer madness that\nyou see this man undergoing of just trying to recreate\nhauling a boat over a mountain, is wild. And the extras that he\nhired to play the natives are the, I think, they're\nMachiguenga tribesmen. They just look like all the\nguys that I hang out with. And it's like, you know, they're doing all this\nstuff in the jungle that months and months and months, and you can just see him\ndeteriorating with madness because the jungle, you know, your boat, you know how many times\nI've tied up a boat to the side of the river? This just happened like\na year and a half ago. Through COVID I pretty much\njust lived in the jungle for a while. And there was nobody there\nand there was no support. And I tied up my boat, and\nthe rain is just hammering, like the universe is trying\nto rip the earth in half. The rain is just going\nand the river's rising, and I tied up the boat. But then you go to sleep and you gotta wake up every\ntwo hours to go check the boat, and the boat is thrashing back and forth. And so all night, every two\nhours I'd wake up barefoot in driving rain, like, you\nknow, golf ball raindrops and just go down, check the boat. And then by morning I was like, I fell asleep, woke up, checked the boat. And then I was like, I'm\njust gonna go make coffee, I was so done, I was so at the end of my rope every time I'm bailing\nthe boat out and stuff. And then we got 15 minutes of heavy rain that filled the boat, sank it. And so now I'm stuck\nup there with no boat. And it's like that type\nof thing where it's like, no matter how hard you try\nthe jungle's just like, \"Listen, you're nothing. You are nothing.\" And so it's that constant reminder. And so Herzog really threw\nhimself into that, in that Film, and it's brilliant to watch. - What do you think he meant by the line that you include in your book, \"It's a land that God, if he exists, has created in anger,\" said in a German accent. - Yeah, overwhelming\nand collective murder. (both laughs) - So he didn't really appreciate\nthe beauty of the murder? - I think he appreciated it,\nbut to him it was very dark. You know, I think he\nsaw the darkness in it, and that's there, it sure is. As soon as you do ayahuasca, that door opens and you see the darkness 'cause it brings you\nright into the jungle, like the heart of it. But I think that for him, it is, I think that darkness is\nsomething that he embraces and that he loves. There's another film of his, and I don't know if this is accurate, but my memory has it\nthat there's a penguin, and I think it's in Antarctica, and the penguin's going\nin the wrong direction, away from the ocean. And I feel like he goes\non this monologue about how he's just had enough. This one penguin is just\nmarching towards, you know. - Yeah. Well, because I remember that clip from that documentary. And what Werner says is that\nthe penguin is deranged, that he's lost his mind. And I took offense to that because maybe that's a brave explorer. Like, how do you know there's\nnot a lot more going on? Like, it could be a love story, those penguins get super attached. - Maybe his mate was over there and he had to go find her, like, you know. - Or it's a lost mate, and he last time he saw was going in that direction. So this is like the great explorer. We assume animals are like\nthe average of the bell curve, like every animal we interact\nwith is just the average, but they're special ones, just\nlike there's special humans. That could be a special penguin. - It could have been. And\nI had the same thought where I was like, I found it beautiful\nhow he interpreted it. What I took away from\nthat was I found that Werner Herzog's monologue there was brilliantly dark and also comedic, but maybe irrelevant biologically\nspeaking towards penguins, like, you know, which\nhappens a lot with animals. I find like, there's so many times where I'll find people be like, \"Do you think that animals\ncan show compassion?\" And you hear like a bunch of people that have never left the\npavement talking about like, \"Wow, this one animal\nhelped another animal.\" It's like, go ask Jane Goodall if animals can show compassion. Go talk to anybody that works on a daily basis with animals. And so like to me, there's a always a\nlittle bit of frustration in hearing people sort of\nlike pleasantly surprised that animals aren't just these automatons of just, what's the word? Like, programmed, you know, nothingness."

      "section": "Jane Goodall",
      "text": "- First of all, what have\nyou learned about life from Jane Goodall? 'Cause she spoke highly of your book and you lister her as one of the mentors. But what kind of wisdom about\nanimals do you draw from her? - The wisdom from Jane is so diverse. I mean, first of all, she's\nsomeone that, you know, the work that she did at\nat the time she did it was so incredible because I\nmean, she was out there at a very young age doing that field work. She was naming her subjects, which everyone said you shouldn't do. She broke every rule,\nshe broke every rule. She was assigning, and everyone said, \"You're anthropomorphizing these animals by saying that they're\ndoing this and that.\" She was like, no, they're interacting. They're showing love,\nthey're showing compassion, they're showing hate,\nthey're showing fear. And she broke straight\nthrough all of those things, and it paid off in dividends for her. - Do you see the animals\nas having all those human-like emotions of anger,\nof compassion, of longing, of loneliness from what you've seen especially with mammals, but with different species out\nthere? Do they have all that? - It depends on the animal. If you're talking on\nthe scale of a cockroach to an elephant, you know, it's\nlike a lot of these things, and I wonder about this\nstuff all the time. You know, I'll have a\npraying mantis on my hand then just go, \"What is\ngoing through your mind?\" Or you'll see a spider make\na complex decision and go, \"I'm gonna make my web there.\" You know, and you go, how are\nyou doing this? How are you? Because he made a calculation\nthere, you know, it's smart. I was in the jungle not that\nlong ago and I was walking. And all of a sudden this dove comes flying through the\njungle right up to my face, lands on a branch, like\nright here, right next to me. I look at the dove, dove looks at me. And she's like, \"Hey.\" And she's clearly, like, panting. And I'm like, why are you\nso close? This is weird. And she's like, \"I know.\" And then, an ornate hawk-eagle\nflies up 10-feet away, looks at both of us and just like scowls, and like sticks up its head feathers and then just flies off. And the dove is like, \"Sweet, thanks,\" and then flew in the other direction. And I was like, \"Dude, you just\nused me to save your life.\" The dove knew. - See. But this is what, because there's different, you know, there's Mike Tyson and\nthere's Albert Einstein. And I sometimes I wonder when\nI look at different creatures, even insects, like, is this\nMike Tyson or is this Einstein? Or other kinds of personal, like, is this a New Yorker\nor is this a Midwesterner? Or is this like a San Francisco\nbarista of the insects? Like, there's all kinds of personalities, you never know, so you can't like project. If you run into a bear\nand he's very angry, it could be just the asshole New Yorker. - Yeah, sure.\n(Lex chuckles) What are you saying\nabout New Yorkers, man? - Exactly. Point well made. So speaking about\ncommunicating with a dove, you first met the crew in the Amazon. You talk about JJ as somebody who can communicate with animals. What do you think JJ\nis able to see and hear and feel that others don't, that he's able to\ncommunicate with the animals? - When I say this is the most skilled jungle man I've ever seen, and I know so many guys in the region. He has libraries of\ninformation in his cranium that we cannot fathom, it's just stunning. Like, you know, I have seen him use medicinal plants to cure things that western doctors couldn't cure. I've seen him navigate in such a way that he's not using the stars, he's not using any discernible, you know. It's like when elephants, sometimes you'll watch a herd of elephants and they'll be like, \"Yo, let's\ngo. We're going this way,\" and you'll see them sort of communicate, but there's no audible sound. They'll just decide that they're going, and they all do it. JJ has this way in the jungle\nof, you know, he'll stop and he'll go, \"Wait,\" and you go, \"What is it?\" And he goes, \"There's a\nherd of peccary coming.\" And I'm like, where? Based on what? And he's like, \"Just wait, you'll see,\" and he'll sit there. - [Lex] You think that's just experience? - It's incredible experience. It's growing up barefoot in the Amazon. And the gift is that he\ncan speak fluent English. And so when I bring\ntourists and scientists or news reporters down there,\nhe can communicate with them. He's actually good on camera 'cause he doesn't care about cameras. And like for instance, we were walking up a\nstream a few months ago, and I went, \"Hey, look, Jaguar tracks.\" And he went, \"Whoa.\" And I was like, \"What, Jaguar tracks?\" And he's like, \"No, look. Look harder.\" And I was like, the toes\nare deeper than the back? And he was like, \"Uh-huh,\nand where are they?\" And I was like, \"By the water.\" And I was like, \"The Jaguar is drinking,\" it was leaning to drink. And he was like, that's right. He's like, \"Now look behind you.\" I look behind me and there's scat, there's a big log of\nJaguar shit sitting there and it's got butterflies all over it. - [Lex] Fresh?\n- Pretty fresh. And then there's another\none that's less fresh. And so he's teaching me as he does, he's just going, \"Look\nat this, look at this. Is that one as fresh as this one?\" No. And then he goes, \"Now look up.\" I look up. There's\nthree vultures above us. The kill is near us, the jaguar has been coming\nmultiple times to the river to drink as it's feasting\non whatever it killed. And he's going, \"It's within\n30 feet of us right now.\" And it's like, I'm like, oh look,\nimpression's in the sand, he's like, I just drew\n19 conclusions from that. It's like watching\nSherlock Holmes at work. - Reconstructing the crime scene. - [Paul] Incredible. - Does that apply also\nto be able to communicate with the actual animals? Like, read into their\nbody movements directly into whatever that dove was saying to you, to be able to understand? Or is that all just kind of\ntaking in the complex structure of the crime scene, of the interactions of\nthe different animals of the environment and so on? Like, what is that that you're able to communicate with another creature, that he was able to communicate\nwith another creature? - He knows the intention of pose, he knows the habits, he\nknows the perspective. When he talks about animals, he'll talk about each\nspecies as if it's a person. So he'll say, \"Oh, the Jaguar, she never likes to let you see her.\" And so he'll come back from\nthe jungle and he'll go, \"Oh, I was watching monkeys and this Jaguar was also\nwatching the monkeys, but I was being so\nquiet she didn't see me. And then when she see me,\nshe feels so embarrassed and she go.\" And he'll tell you this story like as if he had this interaction\nwith his neighbor. And he'll be like, \"Oh, the\npukakunga it never does that, you won't see it do that.\" One time he caught a fish,\nit was such a big fish, it was this big beautiful\npseudoplatystoma, this tiger catfish, this amazing old fish, and they're all excited to eat it. And I felt so bad watching\nthis thing gasp on the sand. And I went, you know what? We don't need this, this is for fun and threw it back. And then I took my hand and I went, and I made like drag marks. Like, so I could say it\nsnuck back in the water. And so he walks up, he looks at it and he\nwas like, \"I hate you.\" And I went, what? No. I said, \"It must have just.\" He went, \"That's not what happens.\" He goes, \"It goes like this when it go,\" he knew the track of a fish. And I was like, \"Oh yeah.\" I was like, \"All right, JJ, I'm sorry. I'll catch you another fish.\" - So stepping back to that way\nyou opened \"Mother of God.\" Who was Santiago Durand, and\nwhat secret did he tell you? - JJ's father was, at some point, he was a policeman, at some point when he was a teenager, he was working on the boats\nthat before this little gold mining city of Puerto Maldonado grew, the only way to get supplies in was to take canoes up the Tambopata River up to the next state, which is Puno where the mules would come\ndown from the mountains with supplies and then\nhe'd pilot the boats down. But they didn't have motors at that time, so he would be pulling the boat. So he became this\nphysically terrifying man. And I met him in when he was in his 80s and he was still living out\nin the jungle by himself. And I mean, he's seen\nan anaconda eat a tapir, which is a cow-sized mammal in the Amazon, he'd seen uncontacted tribes face-to-face. He once killed an 11-foot electric eel, opened the back of the thing's neck, removed the nerve that he says was the source of the electric. Then he cut his forearm, placed that nerve into his forearm, wrapped it with a dead toad, and claims that it would give him strength through the rest of his life. And continued to be a jungle\nbadass until the day he quietly leaned back at a\nbarbecue and ceased to be alive. The man was incredible. But the secret that he told\nus was that if you wanna find big anacondas, you know, if you wanna see the Yacumama, he was like, \"You have to go to the boayo, the place of boas, the place that we came to\ncall the floating forest. And so he sent us there and it\nbecame like this pilgrimage. You know, in the Amazon, a lot of the creation\nmyths are based around the anaconda coming down from the heavens and carving the rivers across the jungle. And if you look at the\nrivers, it looks like that, it looks like the path of an anaconda crawling through the jungle,\nit's even the right color. And so from the reference\nto the tribes of women, the Amazons to the anaconda mother, everything in the Amazon\nis very feminine based. Even the trees, the largest\ntrees in the jungle, the mother of the forest,\nthe Madre de la selva, is the kapok tree, and it's\njust this monster tree, these beautiful ancient trees. And that was the beginning\nof the transition that we made from me\nbeing like, I hate school, I want to go on adventures. You know, Jane Goodall got\nto do all this amazing stuff. I'm just a kid stuck here to eventually becoming\nsomething that had to do with where my identity became the jungle, where my life became the jungle. The secret that he told\nus opened that door, because when we started working\nwith these giant snakes, it started getting attention. It started getting people\nto go, what are you doing? And it started allowing me\nto have experiences that solidified and nailed down the fact that this wasn't just like a weekend retreat, this was something that I was born to do. - And gave you more and more motivation to go into these uncharted territory of the Yacumama?\n- [Paul] Yacumama. - Which, just to step back, what nations are we talking about here? Some geography, what are we talking about? Where is this? - [Paul] So I'm in Peru, we're in Peru. - Which is a South American nation. - Peru is a South American nation. Brazil has 60% of the Amazon, which is unfortunate because\nanything that happens politically in Brazil has a\nmassive impact on the Amazon. Peru has the western Amazon, and Ecuador has a little\nbit of the western Amazon. The western Amazon is\nwhere the Andes mountains, the cloud forests, which\nis a megabiodiverse biome, falls into the western Amazon lowlands. And so you have the meeting of\nthese two incredible biomes, and that's what makes this\nlike superlative, incredible, you know, glowing moment of life on earth. So yeah, we're in Peru\nin the Madre de Dios, which is the mother of God, which I always thought was\nsuch a beautiful, you know, the jungle is the source of all life. And so we were with the Ese-Eja people, and they belong to a community\nthat's called Infierno, which was given by the missionaries who when they tried to go\nbring these people Jesus, got so many arrows shot at them they just called it hell. And so, Santiago Durand\nhelped unite these tribes that were sort of scattered\nthrough the jungle and get them status,\ngovernment-recognized status as indigenous people. So he was sort of a hero, he was sort of a legend for\na lot of the stuff he'd done out barefoot with just like a rifle and a machete in the jungle. He had 19 children, and the last one, I think the\n20th child that he adopted was a refugee from the Shining Path that floated down the river, and he just took him in. This is just a guy that was a, you know, everything he did, like when he died, the whole region showed up. He was somebody, so just\nthe fact that I know him gives me street credit. Like, the fact that I knew him, I can go like, oh, I knew Santiago and people are like, no. I'm like, yeah, yeah. - So you had to get\nintegrated to the culture, to the place that mean,\nin every single way, which is tough for you\nbeing from New York. - Yeah. It could have been tough, but I took to it. You know, the jungle, they were very, you know, JJ's teaching me about medicines and we were doing bird\nsurveys and, you know, taking data on macaw populations. JJ was just like, \"You really wanna,\" like, he goes, \"You gotta sleep.\" And I was like, \"I only\nhave a few weeks here, I don't know if I'm ever gonna come back, I'm never going to sleep.\" So we'd be out every night looking for all the wildlife we could. I wanted to take photos,\nI wanted to see things. And then, the exchange came with that, he was like, \"I'm terrified of snakes.\" And I said, \"Oh, I've\nalways worked with snakes.\" I said, \"I'll teach you\nhow to handle snakes.\" And then we just had this\nlike little exchange. And then when I left, after\nmy first time back in 2006, you know, I said, \"How can I help?\" And they were like, look, you know, we're out here trying to protect this little island of forest\nthat is going to be bulldozed. And the more people that you can bring, the more knowledge and the more awareness that you can bring to this, it'll help. And so really at that\nage, at 18 years old, I sort of started dabbling\nwith the idea of that I could be part of helping these people to protect this place that I loved. And of course, at that time, that idea seemed like too large of a dream or too large of a challenge to that I could actually impact it."

      "section": "Anacondas",
      "text": "- So what was the journey of\nlooking for these giant snakes, of looking for anacondas?\nAnd what are anacondas? - Anaconda is the largest snake on earth. So you have reticulated\npythons in southeast Asia, they're actually longer, but anacondas are these massive\nboas, they give live birth. And unlike a lot of other species, so an anaconda starts off,\na little two-foot anaconda, just a little thicker than\nyour finger, a little baby. And they're food for cane\ntoads, herons, crocodiles, you name it, they're pretty\nharmless, defenseless. But as they grow, they're eating the fish, they're eating the crocs. And then they grow a little more and they're eating things like capybara and they're eating larger prey. And then at the end of their\nlife, a female anaconda, you're talking about a 25, 30-foot, 300, 400-pound snake with a\nhead bigger than a football. And these things, that\nmeans that they impact the entire ecosystem,\nwhich is very unique. - [Lex] Moves up the food\nchain to become basically-- - An apex predator.\n- [Lex] Yeah, apex predator. - The apex predator of the rivers, and so. - That's so interesting, just eating your way up the food chain. - Eating your way up the food\nchain, if you can survive. And like they're constantly\nat war with everything else. So I showed up in the Amazon, I was like, so where the anacondas at? And they were like, oh,\nno, no, it's not like that. They're like, you have\nto find these things. They're subterranean, they're\nliving in the special swamps. People kill them. And so we went to the floating forest after we'd come back from an expedition. We'd caught like a 12-foot anaconda. And now it's become like\nthis like classic photo of me and JJ with this\nanaconda over our shoulders. And we were like, you know,\n12 days out in the jungle on a hunting trip, we came back and we showed his dad. And Santiago looked at us and he was like, \"That's the smallest anaconda\non deep dive I've ever seen.\" He's like, you guys are pathetic. - [Lex] Oh man, 12 foot. - And he was like, \"Look, you go.\" He was like, go. He's like, \"I'm giving you permission. Go to the boayo, go to\nthe floating forest.\" And so we went to this place, and we reached there at night. And it was me, JJ and one of his brothers. And his brother took one look\nat it and was like, \"I'm out,\" and he started walking back. And me and JJ get to\nthe edge of this thing, and this is our friendship,\nit's about this two idiots pushing each other farther and farther. And like, I like put a foot on\nthe ground and it all shook, and the stars are\nreflecting on the ground. And what we realize is that it's a lake with floating grass on top of it. And there's islands of\ngrass floating on this lake, very \"Life of Pie,\" and the tops of trees\nare coming out of the surface of the water. And so we start walking\nacross this, and JJ's going, \"These are big anacondas.\" And I'm going, \"JJ, that's\na two-foot wide smooth path sneaking through the grass.\nThere's no anaconda that big.\" And he was going, \"Shh,\nthey're listening.\" I said, \"They don't have ears.\" He goes, \"They're listening.\" And it's like, we're\nwalking and we're walking, maybe it's like 1:00 AM or something. And it was just like one of those moments where we saw it at the same time. And we were standing by the tail. And the snake was so big that, I mean, this must have been a\n25-foot anaconda dead asleep, with a probably a 16-foot\nanaconda sprawled across her. And they're laying in the starlight and we're floating on top of a lake standing there in the\nmiddle of the Amazon. And JJ just, I could feel the\nblood drain outta his face. And as like a however old\nI was, maybe 20 years old, I just said, \"If we could\nsomehow show people this, we'll be on the front cover\nof National Geographic and we can protect all\nthe jungle that we want.\" And so I tried to catch it. Yeah, so I jumped on the snake and the only measurement I\nhave of this animal is that when I wrapped my arms around it, I couldn't touch my fingers. And so I was, you know,\nmy feet were dragging. And to her credit, this\nanaconda did not turn around and eat me 'cause her head\nwas, you know, this big. And she went, and she reached\nthe edge of the grass island, and she starts plunging into the dark. And so I'm watching the stars vibrate as this anaconda is going. And I had to make the choice\nof either going headfirst down into the black, which, no thank you, or stopping and just keeping\nmy hand on this thing as it raced by me. And I just felt the scales\nand the muscle and the power go by and then eventually\ntapered down to the tail until it slipped away into the darkness. And I was laying there, just panting. And then I turned around and\nwent, \"JJ, what the fuck? Where were you man?\" He was just like completely\nwhite, circuits blown, and I had to go and kind\nof like take care of him. I was like, \"Are you okay?\" And he was like, \"No.\" You know, he just couldn't. And so we came back with that. And then after that we were like, okay, clearly the parameters of reality that we thought were possible\nare just a tiny fraction of what's out there. That sort of recalibrated us, we were like, okay. We're rubbing up against things that are bigger than we\nthought were ever possible. And so we were like, okay, now we need to concentrate on this. - So how dangerous is\nthat creature to humans? - To humans, not at all. Our cook's father-in-law\nwas eaten by an anaconda, but like, you know. - Love the way you say that and tell that story. Sometimes it happens. - It happens. I mean, come on, every now and then somebody\ngets stung by a bee and dies. Like, you know, once\nin a while it happens. But you gotta have a really\nbig anaconda really hungry. And like, anybody that works in the wild, I mean just, you know. If you walk up to a crocodile, even a giant Nile crocodile,\nyou walk up to them, most of the time they're\ngonna run into the water. They don't want confrontation, they hunt in their way\non their terms, sneaky, you're not gonna see him. And so with an anaconda, it's like, yeah. I mean the guy who got eaten, like if you're drunk and you\ngo to the edge of the water and you go for a midnight swim by yourself in an Amazonian lake, I\nmean, whose fault is that? - But if you jump on an\nAnaconda, try to hold on, then you're safe. - Apparently. I think at this point, the research we've done, I\nthink I've handled or caught over 80 anacondas in the field, and not one of them has bitten me. They always choose flight over fight. They're like, just leave\nme alone, let me go. I'm just gonna crawl under this thing. They're not an aggressive\nanimal, I mean, no snake. The only time I get particular\nwith like, you know, the words is like, people\ngo, that's an aggressive, black mambas are aggressive. And I go, no snake is aggressive. A rattlesnake is gonna\nrattle to say, hey, back up, cobra's gonna stand up\nand show you it's hood. And people go, \"Oh look,\nhe's being aggressive.\" No, he's not being aggressive, He's going, don't step on\nme, don't make me do this. They're actually being very peaceful, that's the way I look at it. 'Cause if there was a cobra\nin the corner of this room right now, he would\ncrawl under the curtain and we'd never see him again. - Yeah, it's like Genghis Khan before conquering the villages, he always offered for\nthem to join the army. - Doesn't need to be like this. - Yeah, join us, nobody gets destroyed. If you want to be proud\nand fight for your country, then we're gonna have to deal with it. - Oblige him. - Exactly, okay. So how do you catch, actually let's step back because there is, in part you are a bit\nof a snake whisperer. What is it that others don't understand that you do about snakes? What's maybe a misconception? Or what have you learned\nfrom the language you speak that snakes understand? - I don't know. It's an\nanimal that has many times in my life I've been\nresponsible for helping. I started catching snakes\nwhen I was very young, I'd watch Steve Irwin and go\nout and catch a garter snake or a black rat snake in New York. And then I had a rule. I said I have to catch a\nhundred non-venomous snakes before I'm allowed to\nhandle a venomous snake, if I ever need to handle a venomous snake. And then, I was on a trail one time, I think in Harriman State Park. And some guy, like some big\nhero, he tells us, you know, he is like, \"Back up, I'm gonna get this.\" And he like picks up a\nstick and he goes to assault this poor copperhead that's\nsitting on the trail. And so, at like 16 years old, I had to go and shoulder\nthis guy out of the way and I got the thing by the tail and used a stick to very gently\njust put it off the trail. Copperhead was not gonna\ndo anything to him, but he wanted to beat his chest and show his wife that he was tough. But then in India, you know, I've lived in India for\nfive years at this point in and out, periodically, and snakes are always getting\ninto people's kitchens. One time we had a king cobra\nget into someone's kitchen, an 11-foot snake, like a\nmonster, like a god of a snake. This thing stood up, it would stand up, he'd be able to look\nat you over the table. (Lex laughs) And this terrifying monster thing, this giant gorilla dog thing, like we caught it with one\nof the local snake catchers and we brought it out and he goes, \"You know, \"I wonder why\nit was in the kitchen.\" And I went, yeah, looking for food. And they go, no, they eat snakes. King cobra, ophiophagus\nhannah, they eat snakes. And he goes, \"She's thirsty.\" And so we got a bottle of water, and we got footage of this. She's standing up, she's going, \"Don't make me kill you,\ndon't make me kill you. You're scaring me right now,\nI don't want to kill you.\" We took the bottle of water\nand we poured it on her nose and she started drinking. You could see her just drinking, and the snake just took this long drink, she drank a whole water bottle. And then said thank you\nso much, and crawled off. And it's like, to me, the fact that people are scared of snakes, they have symbolic hatred of snakes, you know, if someone's evil and sneaky, we call them a snake. And like to me it's like,\nwhen I take volunteers or researchers or students\nout into the jungle and we find an emerald tree\nboa or an Amazon tree boa, or a vine snake. It's one of the few animals, like you can't really catch\na bird and show it to people, you're gonna scare the bird, its feathers are gonna come out, you might give it a heart attack. Snakes, you can lift up a snake. You know, if there's a\nsnake in the room right now, I could lift it up and say, Lex, here, this is how you hold it, and we could interact\ncalmly with this thing and then put it back on its\nbranch and then it'll go. And I've seen what that does to people, I've seen how the wonder in their eyes. And so to me snakes have always\nbeen this incredible link to teach people about\nwildlife, about nature. - Because they have\nnaturally a lot of fear towards this creature and to realize that the\nfear is not justified, is not grounded, or is not as\ndeeply grounded in reality. Of course there's always\nNew Yorker snakes, right? There's always gonna be an\nasshole snake here and there. - Coming for me, man.\n(Lex laughs) - Well, okay, so back to the anaconda. How do you catch an anaconda? How do you handle, because\nit's such a 25-foot or even 12-foot, these giant snakes. How do you deal with this creature? How do you interact with them? - We had to learn how to do that 'cause one of the first ones\nwe caught that I would say maybe like a 16 footer,\nwhich is no joke of a snake, girth of a basketball, I'd say. You know, we're on the canoe, and this is the early days. Like, you know, now we're\nat a whole different level, but this is back when we\nwere barefoot and shirtless and just guys in the Amazon. And JJ's like, you know,\nI just listen to him. He'd be like, \"Get off the\nboat, you come from the top, we're gonna come from the bottom.\" So okay, I just did as I was told. I came in, the snake is\nall curled up, dead asleep. She's got some butterflies on her eyes trying to get salt and stuff. And all of a sudden I see the tongue, and I'm like, \"She's awake.\" And I'm like, \"Guys, guys, guys.\" They're paying attention\nto not crashing the boat to getting over there, and\nwe're all trying to run. Snake starts going into the water, so I run ahead, grab this\nsnake, get her by the head. So you got her by the head, you think, okay, she can't get me. I got her right behind the head and it's about this thick, the neck. - What's that feel like,\nsorry to interrupt, like grabbing this thing\nwith this giant head? - [Paul] It's exciting,\nit's amazing, it's scary. - How hard is it to hold? - It's not that hard to hold. The scary part is the moment of, it's like if you've ever done\na cliff dive or something, it's that moment where\nyou go, do it, do it, the time, like do it. And if your body's\ngoing, \"Do not do that,\" and then you're like, I gotta\njust do it, and you do it. - Because you can't just\ngently flirt with it, you have to grab the thing.\n- No. And it's like crossing the\nstreet when there's a bus coming. It's like, if you hesitate\nit's more dangerous. So like, you go for it. And I got her, and I\nwas like, \"I got her.\" And then a coil goes over my wrists. And all of a sudden my\nwrists slap together, and you feel this squeeze\nthat can crush the bones out of an animal bigger than me. And the next coil comes\nvery quickly over my neck. And now I'm on my knees with my arms tied, if I wanted to let go of\nthe snake, I couldn't. And my shoulders are coming together and my collarbone is about to break. And I tried to yell for JJ and\nall that came out was, \"Ugh,\" there's nothing. And so that's what they do\nto their prey, you know? So I attacked, as far as\nthe snake knows, I attacked. She doesn't know that I\njust wanna measure her. - You started out as the big spoon, but then the snake became the big spoon. - The snake very much\nbecame the big spoon. I would say I was 15 seconds away from having my entire ribcage collapsed, and then JJ showed up and grabbed the tail and just started unwrapping\nthis thing, and then we got. But now we have a system, now we know, you know. I've gotten more head\ncatches than anybody, so I'm usually point guy. - You're the first, the point guy. - [Paul] I'm the point guy.\n- Okay. Taking the big risky first step. - Yes. Although it could be argued that there's a similarly large\nrisk for the tail guy because anacondas' defense is to take a giant projectile shit. And so the person that gets the tail is gonna smell like anaconda\nfor at least a week. - Yeah, so it's the least pleasant. You're taking the most\ndangerous one there. They have the least pleasant job, but this is fascinating. - But what's really\nfascinating though is that because they're the apex\npredator, they're eating the fish, they're eating the birds,\nthey're eating everything. And everything in this\nriparian ecosystem is absorbing the mercury that's coming off\nthe gold mining in the region. And so anacondas can be indicative for us of how is mercury moving\nthrough this ecosystem. And this is a region where\nwe've lost hundreds of thousands of acres to artisanal gold\nmining where they use mercury to bind the gold. They cut the forest, burn the forest, and then they run water through the sand and the sand particles\nhave bits of gold in it. Not chunks, but just little, almost microscopic flex of gold, and then they use the\nmercury to bind that. And then they burn off the mercury, and that vapor goes up into the clouds. So just like everything else,\nit's all connected down there, and then rains down into the rivers. And so the people in the\nregion are having birth defects from the amount of mercury\nthat's in the water. And so we were starting, at one point when we were doing most of our anaconda research, we were learning things like, these animals actually\naren't just ambush predators, which is what most of the\nliterature would tell you, is that anacondas are ambush predators, no, they actually go hunting. They'll go find clay\nlakes and salt deposits and they'll wait there, they'll\nactually pursue animals. And we were trying to take\ntissue samples to find out if anacondas could be used to study how mercury's moving through the ecosystem. And so that was really, it became, can we use these animals\nnot only as ambassadors for wildlife, because everybody\nwants to see the anacondas, but also, you know, what can\nwe learn from studying this very, very little\nunderstood apex predator. - And one of the things you can learn is how mercury moves through the ecosystem, which can damage the ecosystem in all kinds of different ways. - Yeah, it's brutal man, the gold mining that's\nhappening down there is. It's funny 'cause we've\nbeen hearing a lot recently about like the cobalt mines in Africa. And it's like, where we are in the Amazon, we were down there with ABC News I wanna say like a year and a half ago with my friend Matt Gutman, who's the chief correspondent for ABC. He wanted to see the Amazon fires, he wanted to see some wildlife, he wanted to see the areas\nthat we're protecting. And then he goes, \"I wanna\nsee the gold-mining areas.\" And I'd never gotten in so deep, but we met this Russian guy, you can't go, the Peruvian, they will kill you. Like, our lawyer's father was assassinated for standing up to the gold miners. There was two Russian guys though who had a legal mining concession somehow way out past the machine gun guarded limit of the Pampas, which is where\nthey do all this gold mining. And we got in there and\ntook footage of the desert that is forming in what used to be the headwaters of the Amazon rainforest. And it's like there is\na massive global scale ecological crime happening down there that you can see from space from this unregulated gold mining. And the cops can't go there\n'cause they will be murdered, it's completely lawless. - What's the machine gun limit exactly? - It's the border of this area\nthat they call the Pampas, which is where the rainforest has been cut and completely destroyed, and it looks like Mars, it's just sand. And inside of this area are gold miners. We tried to get in there to film years ago and there's just a lot\nof guys with machine guns who don't let that happen. - And what, the Russian guys have-- - The Russian guys had access somehow. They'd come down with a bit of money and they had a new system, yeah. And actually, what was interesting\nis while I was in there, they're very friendly, and really, really two\nfriendly gold miners. One of them while I was there, you know, he kind of tapped me on the shoulder. He was like, you know,\n\"Look at those guys.\" He was like, \"Those guys over there\" he goes, \"I just heard\nthem say your name.\" And he goes, \"That's not a good thing.\" He goes, \"They know exactly who you are.\" He goes, \"I wouldn't\nkeep posting to Instagram about gold mining in the Amazon.\" And I was like, okay,\nthanks for the warning. And then, you know, in June\nsomebody pulled up beside me on a motorcycle and I\ngot a more stern warning. - They pay attention to\nthe flow of information 'cause they don't want\nthe world to find out. - Oh, the last thing they\nwant is to be shut down. But the gold miners are\nnotorious for, you know, just whacking people and\nthrowing them in a pile of gold mining leftovers. The Peruvian government\nhas to get the military to go after them. Like, the work we've\ndone with gold miners, converting them into\nconservationists has all been like, I mean I've seen the\nPeruvian navy come down and literally blow up gold mining barges, and, you know, it's a war. It's a war being fought in the Amazon. - So it's possible to convert\nthem into conservationists? What's that process like? Or is that like, you say that in jest? - No, I say that in absolute sincerity. We went upriver, up the Malinowski\nRiver several years ago, and I think it was 2018. And everyone was like,\nyou are going to die. Like, you will be shot and killed. And the reason we were able\nto do it with relative safety was that the gold miner\nthat we were going with was the brother-in-law of one of my closest friends\ndown there, our expedition chef and one of the directors of Junglekeepers. And they said, \"Look, you can\ngo, just keep a low profile.\" And so I went up with a photographer and we spent a week there. Dead animals everywhere,\ndeforestation everywhere. I mean the things that\nwe saw were so horrible. And we're living with these\ngold miners that are, you know, they're getting their gold,\nthey're burning off the mercury. I watched the guy smoking a cigarette, burning the mercury off of his gold with the vapor going\nstraight into his face with his child right there. I mean, unbelievable\nnegligence of just sanity. And then towards the end of the week, the Peruvian navy comes down the river and everyone starts scrambling. And I was like, I'm just gonna\nsit here with my hands up 'cause, you know. And they didn't even stop. They found the gold mining barge, you know, they have a\nfloating thing in the river that just plumbs the bottom of the river, just sucks all the sediment up. And they stopped and they\nstrapped a bunch of explosives to this motor. And good lord, the\nsound of this explosion. And there was just hot metal raining down all over the place, and\nthen they just went. A bunch of guys in fatigues and they just kind of like\nlooked at us, like, peace. And I sat there with this gold\nminer and I went, now what? And he went, \"Well, now I\ngotta go get a new motor.\" And I went, \"Why don't you\njust do something else?\" And he goes, \"What else is there?\" And I went, \"Look what we do.\" And I sat there with my\nphone and I was like, \"See this? These are pretty tourists. And we feed them food and we show them tarantulas and macaws.\" And he looked at this and he went, wow. He goes, \"That looks like so much fun.\" And I went, \"It is so much fun.\" I said, we show people, we\nbring students to the jungle. He goes, \"So you're saying\nif I build you a lodge you'll bring people?\" I said yeah. And I came back a year later and he sat there with a chainsaw, a hand saw and some nails. And he cut down like 17 palm trees and he built an ecotourism lodge. - So you give him another\nchannel of survival, of making money.\n- [Paul] Yes. And that's what we've been\ndoing through Junglekeepers for loggers and for all kinds\nof extractors is just saying, look, what do you make? You make $15 a day\ndestroying the ancient trees of the jungle? What if we paid you $35 a day to have a uniform and a\njob and health insurance and security, and you just protect it? And use all of the jungle\nknowledge you've gained as a logger to protect this place. - Who are the loggers trying\nto destroy the Amazon? Can you say a little bit more about it? Is that as a threat to\nthe Amazon rainforest? - A lot of them are really\nclose friends of mine. They're people that need to make a living, and they're jungle people who, you know, the rainforest is a very challenging, especially the Amazon is a\nvery challenging environment. And so you have these people who, they have a chainsaw, they have a job opportunity, they go out and they cut the trees. And a lot of these guys grew up fishing, they grew up in the jungle,\nthey know how to do it. And so for them it's a way\nto like, they also love it. So this is the thing,\nthese are outdoorsmen, these are guys that love the jungle. You know, in the 90s we\nhad the mahogany boom where they went out after the mahogany, and you almost can't find a mahogany tree in the jungle anymore. And if you wanna talk about\nlike carbon sequestration in the rainforest, the ancient\nhardwoods hold like 60% of the carbon of the whole rainforest. They have an outsized\ndisproportionate mess from that ancient density of the wood. And so these loggers go\nout and they cut the wood that's most valuable and then\nthey bring it back to town and they sell it. And then people like us buy it and put it on our kitchen floors. So the thing is, you know, when I got to the Amazon it was, you know, loggers are the bad guys. And if you talk to a lot of\nthe PhDs that I worked with down there were always very\nat odds with the miners, at odds with the loggers. And then I'd be with JJ,\nand JJ would sit down, and he'd be like, \"Hey,\nlet's pour a drink.\" Oh, they have masato, let's all sit down.\" And like we'd all be chilling\nand throwing 'em back with a bunch of loggers. And then the opportunity through\nnot vilifying these people came to be like, these guys are great. You know, and then of\ncourse out in the wild, every now and then something will happen, you'll see somebody's boat flipped over and you go help 'em out and then that creates a\ncertain type of kinship. - So they're ultimately people who love the same thing you love. - Often, yeah. Even if they don't love\nit, they're people that aren't necessarily looking to destroy it. I've met loggers who have looked at trees they're about to cut and\ngone, ah, this is a shame. Start it up. You know, they're just like, this is where the paycheck comes from."

      "text": "- Let's come back briefly to anacondas. Can you tell me this whole situation with Discovery's \"Eaten Alive?\" There's some drama and\ncontroversy around that. Can you explain that\nwhole saga with Discovery, with your whole effort? Maybe outside of even the drama, the initial thing, which I now feel you're sufficiently insane to actually do, of being eaten by an anaconda. Is that actually possible to\nsurvive something like that? - I mean, if an anaconda swallows you while you're wearing the\nsuit that they made, maybe. But that was in hindsight\nthat was the result of, look, I go to the jungle and you start seeing\nthese beautiful places, these incredible species, you start developing a\nrelationship with these animals. And then you watch it get destroyed, every year we watch it burn, every year, places that\nare are crucial to my soul, I have seen leveled and turned to ash. And at some point we started going, someone has to do something about this. And you look to your right\nand you look to your left and there is no one 'cause\nit's the middle of the Amazon, and the rainforests have\nbeen being destroyed since the 70's, it's a cliche. And so we started trying\nto do something about it, so I started putting a\nlittle bit more emphasis on publicity, a little bit more emphasis on getting the message out there. And so I started trying to\nsee how, what was gonna work. You know, you just start firing shots in the dark and seeing. And you know, JJ's going, \"You have to help us do something,\" and I'm going, okay. And so from 18 years old,\nnow I'm 23 years old, and all of a sudden this place isn't foreign\nto me anymore, it's home. - You're trying to think\nof all the different ways you can bring attention to\nthis place that you care about that's being destroyed? - Yeah. You're standing next\nto a boulder of progress of destruction and it's\nabout to roll onto the forest and just destroy it and\nsnuff out all that life, and no one's there to\ndo anything about it. And so you go, is there any\nway that I could put myself in front of this boulder and hold it back? And you're talking about, you know, the global economic reality, it's just such a massive, it's systemic. - So what's the most dramatic\npossible thing I could do? - Exactly. So when you\nfind yourself flown to LA as a 23-year-old dude, and you're sitting there with some guy who's like spinning a pen and\ngot his feet up on the desk, and going, you know, what\ncan you show us down there? And you go, I could show\nyou the biggest anacondas in the world and we\ncould talk about mercury and bioaccumulation,\nand we could show people how these animals are misunderstood. And we go on a big expedition and we could be the coolest show ever. And he goes, \"Yeah, not good enough.\" And you go, okay, and so that cycled\nthrough a bunch of times. And someone at some point in one of those meetings\nsaid, \"What if we show people that anacondas really can eat humans?\" And I went, how is that a good show? You want me to feed\nsomeone to an anaconda? And I said, and I kind of joked, I was like, the only way that's feasible is if you make a suit\nwith a breathing apparatus and let the snake eat you\nand then come back out safely and make sure you don't hurt the snake. And they were like, \"Kid, you're on.\" And I was like, \"Oh shit.\" - So I should mention as a small tangent. I think I mentioned to you\noffline due to travel troubles, when I traveled to the totally wrong part of the United States on my way to Boston. And on my way to Boston\nI did a conversation with Mr. Beast, Jimmy. And I got a chance to hang\nout with him for the day, and one of the things we did is have a lengthy brainstorm\nsession with his team, or I was observing it. But it was interesting because\nhe's probably way better at that conversation that\nyou had with the guy in LA than the guy in LA, obviously because he's\nrevolutionizing entertainment and he's also doing philanthropy which he's trying to figure\nout how to help the world with that kind of stuff. So I would love to actually, I'll send him a message\nto see what his thoughts. Just brainstorm, he's so strong at this. Literally, take the\nsituation you're facing. Here's the place that I really care about is being burned down,\nit's being destroyed. What's the sexy video? - Yeah. Well, how do you get\npeople to watch something that's, you know, we all change a channel when\nthey show us the kids in Africa with the swollen stomachs,\nnobody wants to see it. And it's like, with the\nrainforest that like, we know, we know, we know. And I'm going, I could\ngive data all day long. I could show photos of burning forest, and so I was looking for what would do it. And so the \"Eaten Alive\" thing, without spending too much\ntime on a massive misstep was I agreed to do it. They paid me at the time more\nmoney than I had made before, which I very much needed 'cause nobody pays you\nto be a conservationist. So I was a very poor 23-year-old. It was like, \"Yes, I\nwould love that, please.\" And I thought, you know what, this is the start of a TV career. We got shafted so bad. I mean they used, somehow\nthey changed our voices, they changed the things we said, they changed the message of the film. There was one point where we\nhad caught a 19-foot snake and I was holding her head and I said, \"This is such a beautiful\nanimal, the queen of the Amazon.\" This is such a great moment for me, I kissed her on the head. I said, \"She's made so many\nbabies, look at the scars.\" I was talking about just the poetry of this incredible dragon. And then the producer goes,\n\"Yeah, yeah, that's great. Listen, if that was to bite\nyou, what would happen?\" And I was like, \"Oh, well if\nit bit you, you'd bleed out cause it would lacerate down to the,\" that's what they put in the film. They didn't show me the film until the night before I\nwent on Matt Lauer's show. And I said I am not endorsing this film. And they had called it, on the call sheet, they'd called it Expedition,\nEA, Expedition Amazon. All of a sudden they\nchanged it to \"Eaten Alive.\" And I went, \"Wait guys, wait, wait.\" I said, \"You're gonna make people think that it actually happened,\nnot that we're attempting it.\" And I said, I'm not. And then they called me and they said, \"You're going on live TV tomorrow.\" They said, \"You let us\nknow what level of control we need to show for you,\" and it was a very threatening phone call. And so I had to go out\nand smile for the cameras and endorse something\nthat was a train wreck. And the scientific community\nwas like, \"You're an idiot. We don't want to ever see you again.\" I lost a lot of opportunities. PETA came, which you know, PETA whatever, but PETA came out, people were like, you were trying to hurt a\nsnake, which I would never do. And then the American Public was like, you said you were gonna\nget eaten by a snake and you didn't. And so everyone was pissed, I basically had to exile myself to India for like six months and just. I mean, I had death threats\ncoming through all my messages, people were furious with me. - What gave you strength to that? How difficult was that, psychologically, just everything you care\nabout being completely kind of flipped upside down? - I've spent so much time on the ground with the local people\nlearning from the wildlife. It's such a devout an\nimportant thing to me, and it got turned into a sideshow. It got turned into a joke,\nand then not just a joke, it got turned into that\nI'm somehow bad to animals, I'm irresponsible scientifically. Jimmy Kimmel told me to\nhave sex with a hippo as my next stunt. Like, it was like, it got really ugly and it misfired so bad. And when you hear these\nlike motivational speakers talk about, you just gotta keep trying and sometimes you're gonna fail hard. It was like, that one\nI got hit in the head with a baseball bat, that one was tough. And at the time I was like, I'm fine. And I was like, I'm gonna\ngo away for a while. And I learned a lot though, like at this point I'm still glad I did it because man did I learn a lot about what a room full of\npeople that you don't know who could look you in the\neye and shake your hand and say, \"Trust us.\" Ooh boy. - Do you have on a human\nlevel of resentment towards Discovery, towards\nthe people involved? Are you able to forgive them? - I don't care. It literally,\nthat's what they do. You know, they literally\nput out a documentary saying that mermaids were real. - Wait a minute, wait\na minute, they're not? Listen.\n(Paul laughs) I'm not even touching that one. - [Paul] It's true, it is true. There is a documentary where they duped a bunch of scientists who are like oceanographers, and they showed them ancient footage of mariners saying that seals\nwere mermaids, who cares? I was young, I got brought to Hollywood and I got spit out the other side, and that's on me, that's not their fault. There's that parable about the frog who gives the scorpion\na ride across the water. And then at the end he says, \"I'll give you a ride,\njust don't sting me.\" And they get to the other side\nand the scorpion stings him and the frog goes, \"Why did you do that?\" And the scorpion goes, \"I'm a scorpion.\" It's not their fault. - That's in my nature. But now that you've become\nmuch more well known and much more successful at what you do, you have a platform. Can you return to those people\nand use it, the machine, to get more and more attention? Is that something you work on, or do you prefer to\nwork completely outside? - I think that most of the\nsuccess that we've had now in protecting the rainforest and it's the levels that\nwe've reached are so far. I think back to those barefoot\ndays of catching snakes with JJ and the boat. And now the massive\necological reserve we have and the team of rangers\nand the converted loggers, and all of that is because of the ability to communicate\nand to show people, but that's all been through social media. And so I'm open to the fact, you know, if somebody came and gave a\nsort of like Bordenian pass where they said, look,\nyou can be yourself. You can swear, you can\nfart, you can smoke, you can do whatever you wanna do, go out there and show us the real thing, I would love to. But now I know how those\ncontracts need to be, I need to have right to refusal\nand they can't change 'em. And so I'd almost rather\njust do it like the way, I think, like Mr. Beast does stuff, where it's like you get a crew\nof guys and some seed money and go film the episodes and put it out. I mean, a committee never\nhelped real art be better, it has to come from the\nsource of inspiration. I think, you get JJ and a crew of people or the guys in Africa that\nI'm working with right now doing elephant conservation and like, but you gotta show real. I mean, look, that's why Joe Rogan is important right now, that's why you're important right now is because it's not being filtered through this ridiculous system of\npolishing it and dumbing it down. - That's why Joe has been an inspiration. You don't need a crew\nof a bunch of people, you don't need a crew, period, all you need is one or two\nother people, and that's it. And in my case, you don't need anybody, I've been doing this. By requirement, I just\nneed to be by myself. There's a few other folks now\nthat are help with the editing and so on, but it's just,\nthey make life more awesome as opposed to a boss, like a creative director. Somebody told me actually,\nI was visiting LA, I think it was in LA. They were saying that, now\nfor all intimate scenes in Hollywood movies, there's\nan intimacy director. So when there's two people having sex, there's a third person\nthat ensures that on film, so it's not real, but\nthere's still intimacy, that there's a third person\nthat ensures that like everyone is comfortable and\nthe actors say that this always ruins the chemistry\nof the scene. (chuckles) It's a very Hollywood thing, I understand there's\ncreepy people and so on. - [Paul] Thanks, Harvey\nWeinstein, by the way. - It's usually I think\ncomes from the director pushing things too hard. If you just leave it to the actors, they know their boundaries, they can control their own boundaries. So the intimacy director is more for the director pushing things. - I understand the logic. Like, let's make sure that\nwe don't have anything happen here that shouldn't be\nhappening, I get it."

      "text": "But no, I think that authenticity\nis the greatest currency. And I think that in order\nfor me to tell the stories that I can tell, like, what\nchanged the game for me was, I wanna tell you the story. So, in 2019, the Amazon fires started popping\noff and we had just gone to film like a month earlier, we'd filmed like a small documentary. And they had been following\nme as if I was on a solo, which we did the best we\ncould, I lived on my own. But as we were driving, we passed a spot where the flames were 70-feet tall, the forest was being destroyed. And I went out there with my phone, which overheated in like\ntwo minutes and said, you can't use it. But for a second I was\nout there in the flames, picking up animals and throwing them off to try and just get them cooled off, I was trying to get snakes\noutta there, everything, the birds are flying,\nand I fucking lost it. I was red-eyed, I was\ncrying and I was going, \"This is happening every fucking day.\" I was screaming, and it's the\nfirst time that I'd done that 'cause I've seen the burning so many times and I just lost it that day. And I don't know what\nmade me pull out my phone 'cause usually in those intense moments I say forget the documentation,\nthis is real life. We got stuff to do and I'm\ndoing, I'm not documenting. And then a month later I'm\nhome and I'm in New York, and all of a sudden I see\nthese articles like, you know, the Amazon's burning worse this\nyear than it was last year, and blah, blah blah. And I was like this, you know, fuck it. And I threw it up on Instagram like eight o'clock at night. I'd never cursed on Instagram, I don't know, you know,\nwhy? I just never did. My phone was on a hundred percent and I put on top of the\nrefrigerator and I went to bed. And I woke up in the morning and my phone was on the floor on 2% and it was ringing off the\nhook, and it was like the news. And they were like, \"Are you the guy that posted that viral\nvideo about the Amazon?\" And I was like, what? And that was the start,\nthat's where it broke. And that's where we went from\nbarefoot in the Amazon to all of a sudden, you know, I was a talking head for three weeks and going around on all\nthese news stations, and all of a sudden I was like the spokesperson for the Amazon. JJ's calling me, and he was\nlike, \"Go, go, go, go, go.\" Like, \"Get us that support.\" And it was just, you know. So communicating with people and bringing them into that reality, and whether it's rhino\npoaching and elephant poaching, or the Amazon being destroyed, it's like, to me, it's like being able to take people into that is\nsomething that I would love to do. - Yeah, and you do it directly with authenticity on your Instagram. People should definitely\nfollow your Instagram, I think Rogan follows your Instagram too. - Well, the end of that story\nactually kind of involves him. 'Cause I went to all these news outlets and I was living in green\nrooms and traveling around and I was all strung out\nand I hadn't seen anybody I actually know in a few weeks, which was starting to get to me. And I finally got home and I\nwent to like a family party, and everyone was like,\n\"Dude, it's been crazy.\" And I was like, yep. And then I left, and my\ncousin Michael calls me and he's screaming, and\nI'm going, \"What, what?\" And he goes, \"Joe Rogan just shared it. Joe Rogan just shared it.\" - [Lex] Oh, nice. - And everyone was losing their\nshit and it was so amazing. And it was like, that's\nwhen it really took off. And what happened as a\nresult of all of this is that a Canadian entrepreneur who started Lightspeed reached out. And several months later,\nafter COVID, after that boom, I'd been in the game for\nmaybe 13 years or something, had no money, no savings,\nno job, no nothing. And after that great publicity\nthing, nothing happened. The waves came and\neverything got real exciting, everybody reached out and\nthey said, \"We care so much.\" Nothing happened, though. You know, we can run into battle, but if we don't have arrows in the quiver, what can we do? And I actually, I made a\nphone call to my friend Mosen right at the start of COVID, and I was going through\ndivorce and I was broke. And I said I'm gonna get a job. I said I give up. This is stupid. I said the ecotourism business is done, Junglekeepers is dried up. We're done. And then this guy Dax Dasilva\ncalled me on the phone and said, \"Listen, I'm\nin. What do we gotta do?\" And so if the analogy was me and JJ and a few other people trying\nto hold this boulder back from just destroying the rainforest, all of a sudden Dax comes in like a titan and just puts his arm out and\njust goes, \"I'm gonna help.\" And he gave us the funding to start actually\ndeveloping a ranger program, to start actually bringing loggers to be protectors of the forest, to be supporting smaller\nconservation things. And now we're protecting\n50,000 acres of rainforests, we're protecting entire streams\nand ecosystems that I love, and we're soon gonna double that. And it's like this whole thing, so yeah. The communication of\nthese things is crucial, and I actually think it's incredible that social media's played\nsuch a big role in it. - Well, I mean just 'cause I know Joe well and I love him so much, I definitely think you\nshould do his podcast but also just be friends\nwith him, I think you guys. He's one, you know, not to meme, but he's one with nature. And I'm much more with the, I'm one, while I do\nappreciate and love nature, I also love technology and robots and so on. So we're in that meme type of way, we're very, very different. - Well, either way, at some point make sure you tell the guy thank you because it definitely really\nhelped push us over that limit where, you know, if enough people see it, you get someone like Dax\nwho who says, \"I can help and I have the resources to help,\" and that changed our whole lives. - Changed everything. Back to the jungle. You had a bunch of\ninteractions with jaguars. How are you still alive? Like, what? - Man, dude. I'll tell you this,\nJags are not the danger, the falling trees are the danger. I'll tell you some elephant stories then you'll then you'll\nwonder why I'm still alive. So JJ started, and Santiago, his dad, started challenging me to do solos, go out alone into the wild style. You know, I'd have a hammock, a headlamp, three days worth of food,\nsome fish hooks, a machete, and that's it. And so, like one of the\nstories that happened early on was I was out there and it\nwas raining, and I was lost. This is how we test your jungle knowledge. Can you survive out there?\nDo you know how to find food? Have you listened to the\nthings that we taught you? And there was one night\nthat I was in a hammock and a jaguar came up, and I\nwas asleep when it happened. And she came up right next to my head and she was (imitates jaguar panting) and I could hear her smelling me. And then my first instinct\nwas to turn on my headlamp, and just the sound of my arm\nmoving against the material, and she just (imitates jaguar growling). Right here, I could feel her breath, and I just laid there in the dark. And that's one of those\nmoments where you go, you really learn a lot about yourself, because I wasn't scared, I felt like I understood\nthe intentions of the cat. If she was hunting, I'd already be dead, she was curious. And I was lost, and I didn't know if I was ever gonna get outta that jungle, but what she did was energize me 'cause it was an experience\nlike the giant anaconda where I said this is so wild that it's so almost cinematically outside the realm of what I\nthought my life could be like that it made me, like, wait, 'cause the previous day I\nwas lost, tired, confused, kind of devastated, tail between my legs. After that, I was like, \"Man, you've been waiting\nfor this your whole life. Go get it.\" And I woke up, and I was\nlike I am gonna navigate. Even though I've been in\nthis swamp for three days, I'm gonna find my way outta this swamp. And like, she just like\nbreathed fire into me, where it was like, if that's possible, if I could be six inches\naway from a jaguar's face. I got that energy from her. - So that you're able to\nstart to really hear and feel the jungle around you. That was a sign that you\nknow what you're doing. - [Paul] It really felt\nlike a sign, I really did."

      "text": "- How do you survive in a solo, solo hike through the jungle? What are the different components, what are the different dangers? So you said you had a\nhammock, you had some food. What kind of food, by the\nway, are we talking about? - Nuts, stuff that won't\ngo bad, because you can't, so you can't really start\na fire in the Amazon. Like, I'm a good, I mean\nI camp all over the place, I'm a wilderness guide. Starting a fire in the Amazon is futile, in fact a lot of survival manuals\nwill tell you don't do it, 'cause if you're really lost,\nit'll break your spirit. You're not gonna be able to do it. - [Lex] That's dark. - They're like, \"Don't even try it.\" But you can still get like hypothermia if you get wet and you\nlay out in the jungle, exposure can still get\nyou, so you want fire. In the beginning I used to\nbring like ramen noodles, which is, nutritionally, is irrelevant. And so I started bringing like nuts and then supplementing that with fish, which forced me to become\na very good fisherman. Now of course JJ knows that he can like, they can cut certain\nroots and they bash it up and they put it in the stream and the fish just float\nto the top, and they take. He's got all the cheat codes, whereas I'm sitting there with a hook. He'll go, \"Now, find bait,\" and I go bait. In the most competitive\necosystem on earth, good luck finding a worm. You can't do it. What does JJ do? He takes the machete, looks at his foot, cuts a slug of callous off of his heel 'cause he's got this thick rhino skin. Puts that on the hook,\ncatches a six-inch fish, chops it in half, puts\nit on a bigger bucket. And in 15 minutes he's got\na four-foot giant catfish that could feed a family of 16. And he's happy, I'm\nsitting there and I'm like, I'm gonna try and stick a\nbeetle on a fishing hook. - Do you have just a line and\na hook or is there a rod too? - Just a line and a hook\nand then you just chop a rod and tie it to the, you know, you just chop a little sapling. - So are you still able\nto start a fire or no? - I like for the food that I\nbring to not be fire-dependent. And so if I have some\nnuts, I can shove in a few, enough calories to get\nme through the night, and leave a fishing line out and there'll be something\nthere in the morning. But yes, I can start a fire but a lot of times what I'll\ndo is I'll bring a flask and not with alcohol but with diesel. And so you have a tuna can\nand you put the diesel. This is what the local guys do. Everything I do, you know, I'm sure there's gonna be\nsomeone listening to this and they're like, \"How could you do that?\" And it's like, this is what\nwe do down there, sorry. It's a tuna can, you pour a\nlittle bit of diesel in it. It burns slow, you light\nit and you put your sticks, you make a pyramid over that, and eventually that will\nburn through the moisture. And finally you'll get a\nvery reluctant little fire enough to burn, you know, to make yourself like a cup of tea or to pour that into the\nnoodles, something, something, or you just eat a fish raw. - How important is it to stay dry, is it basically impossible? - It's impossible to stay\ndry, you're wet all the time. You're wet all the time. - What does that mean? That means infections are more efficient? - Yeah. I don't know\nif you saw the picture in my book where I have the - [Lex] Yellow spots?\n- Yeah. - So yeah, there's a picture with your entire face consumed with yellow spots, it's basically, I guess, that's MRSA? - [Paul] Yeap. - Oh boy. So how did that happen? What was the infection like? And how crazy are you for\nletting that infection stay in you for a long period\nof time without treating it? Or you had no choice? - No, I did have a choice. I was 19 years old and I was\ntaking care of a giant anteater that was orphaned. And this is like my dream\nanimal and she was mine, and my job was to teach her the jungle. And so when I started like\nnoticing that I had an infection, I think I had dengue at the time too, I went back to town,\nprobably picked up MRSA in the hospital where I got tested. Came back into the jungle and\nthen got progressively sicker and sicker and weaker and weaker as I was two weeks, three\nweeks in the jungle. And it got to the point where my vision went black and white and I passed out one day. I don't know why, but at the\ntime I had shaved that day. And when I woke up the next\nmorning, I couldn't open my eyes because the pus had come outta my eyes and the pores in my face,\nall those little microcuts, and the pillow was stuck to my face. I was stuck upriver with\nno help at 19 years old. And also when you see that picture, you can imagine that I\nassumed that my life was over 'cause I didn't know what it was, or at the very least I\nfigured I'd be disfigured the rest of my life, I didn't think there was any\ngetting better from that. And so I remember sitting\nby the side of the river praying that a boat would come by, but it was the rainy season, there aren't gonna be any boats 'cause the river's psychotic. And so, it was a long time\nbefore I got back to town, and I didn't wanna leave the anteater, but it became like, I was\nlike, I realized I was dying. And then I finally got a\nboat with some loggers, a death boat, just loaded with, these guys had gone into the jungle and shot everything they\ncould and taken all the babies and they were gonna go sell them. And so it was like baby\nmonkeys and toucans and birds in cages and\npieces of crocodiles and anaconda skins and\njaguar skins rolled up. And it was just like,\nI was just laying there with all these dead animals in the boat with all the flies on my face. Got back to the hotel, called my mother, said, \"Please book me a flight\nout like today, like today.\" And then I sat on the plane. Somebody sat next to me on the\nplane, and I had a hood on. And I do remember that in the haze, at this point I was having\ntrouble staying conscious, but I do remember that\nshe like looked over trying to see what was\nsitting next to her, and then she got up and never came back. And when I got to immigration\nin New York, you know, the cop, he takes my passport and he goes, \"Yeah, so what were you doing in Peru?\" He is looking down, and he goes, yeah. And he holds up the passport, looks at the passport, looks at my face, he goes, \"Bo, buddy.\" He goes, \"What the fuck?\" And I said, \"No, that's why.\" I was like, \"I'm trying to get\nhome to go to the hospital.\" He stamps it and he goes, \"Go, go, go, go. God bless. God bless.\" He's like, \"Oh shit.\" And then they put me in\nthe room in the hospital with the hazmat suits, and\nthey didn't know what it was. And I spent like five\ndays on IV antibiotics with four different things\nrunning through my veins. The doctors were like,\n\"Don't let it go that close.\" They're like, \"You went\nreal close on that one.\" - Yeah, that's what that picture, I mean people should check out the book just to see the picture, because I imagine you just laying there unable to see, have a fever probably, so you're like half hallucinating. - [Paul] Yep, yep. - And there's no boat, there's no way out. - [Paul] There's no help coming. - Plus there's this creature\nwho you've become a parent of, that you love.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - Boy that's a dark place\nto be as a 19-year-old. I mean, most people will\nnever be in a place like that. Like, where did you find\nstrength in that place? - I don't know. I just remember\nwriting a goodbye letter to my parents 'cause I\nsaid if I die out here, it was really dark,\nlike, it was terrifying. It really felt like it was the end. And I was writing, if you\nfind me out here, I'm sorry, and all that type of stuff. And it was, you know. I don't know about strength,\nthere was no strength, it was just like move forward. And at some point it was like,\nif you'll take me downriver, take me downriver, you know. - You just got lucky with the\nloggers, with the death boat, that they found you?\n- Yeah. - Well, how did the\ninfection start by the way? - I don't know. I really don't know. I mean, we always have\nsome sort of little shit. But the thing is now JJ taught me that there's like three different trees that can cure infections, I didn't know this at the time, I didn't know the cheat codes. Now, if you have a small infection, you can use sangre de grado\nand it'll cure it right away. Like, let's say you have a botfly and it gets a little pus-y, there's a fly living in your skin, you put that on there, not\nonly will it kill the fly, but it'll heal the infection. Now if you have a worse\ninfection, you can go to ojé, which is ficus insipida\nand you can use that. And that will completely\nheal, that will murder, it's like crocodile blood,\nit will murder infections. So like, forget neosporin, that's a joke, these are heavy chemical compounds running through these trees, and they know all about 'em, and so whatever it is. So now at this point,\nthat's no longer an issue because we know how to handle it, which at that time if JJ had been there, I would've been fine. - Well, you learned the hard way. So these are open wounds and then there's creatures\nthat start living in them? Basically, what is it? - Well, that's separate, that's botflies. Yeah, there's a creature\nthat unfortunately, very, very, very unfortunately likes to make its home\ninside the flesh of mammals. And so the flies attach\ntheir eggs to mosquitoes, the mosquitoes go and seek\nout warm-blooded animals. The eggs, microscopic\neggs fall into your skin and then begin to grow. And sooner or later you feel a twitch, and it's a worm living inside of you that's like vertical down in you and it's eating you. And at first it's not a problem, but when they get to about\nas thick as that pen, it starts to hurt 'cause\nyou got a hole in you. And they have a little\nbreathing tube that comes up and they breathe and they go back in and then they eat and they\ncome back up to breathe. You have a friend living in you. - [Lex] You've had one of those? - I've had lots of those,\nit's tough to take 'em out. They have hooks. (both laughs) - How do you? Do you have to? (chuckles) Oh man, you gotta love the jungle. So how do you take it out?\n- You have to come. - [Lex] A hundred percent. - You gotta put an irritant. So like, a lot of times\nwhat we'll do down there is someone will take a\nmassive drag of a cigarette and then they'll power exhale and get some of the tar, which also shows you how much\ntar you get out of a cigarette and then with a knife you\nput that right over the hole. And then you slap some vaseline\nor something on top of that so they can't breathe. And eventually over the\ncourse of a few hours, they'll come up enough looking for air and then you gotta grab 'em with a tweezer and try not to rip him cause then you're gonna get an infection, and you gotta squeeze from the butt, it's a whole ceremony. When people have botflies, we're all like, oh, it's botfly time, let's go. And then like JJ will squeeze, he's got like pliers for thumbs. He can like take a piece of your neck and you think he's going\nto break your skin, he'll just squeeze until\nthis thing comes out. - And you don't wanna, this is an open wound right there. - Yeah, you don't wanna\nbathe for a day or two after until that closes 'cause\notherwise you're gonna have water sloshing around in\na little pocket of yours, it's kind of gross. - And that water might\nhave other organisms in it. - That water in your skin tends to, yeah. I mean the jungle water's\nclean, we drink it. Like, I drink the water\nfresh outta the stream. - [Lex] Oh, that's interesting. - Well, it's just a\ngiant filtration system, all those roots, the whole jungle's constantly purifying everything. - People might be thinking\nabout that with the jungle, there's insects probably\nall over you all the time. - It's not as bad as you think. Like, I've been to Finland,\nLapland in the summer and the mosquitoes are\nhorrendous, like devastating. The Amazon in our area, if you're sitting in a\nhammock reading a book out, our research stations don't\nhave walls or anything, you're good for about one\nmosquito every half hour, which really is not a lot, I mean, it's worse than New Jersey. Like, it's really not that bad. - Tell me a little more about the little baby anteater, Lulu, who you've rescued and\nhad to sadly leave behind. - Yeah, I just was always\nfascinated with giant anteaters. They're this, you know,\nGerman shepherd sized thing with Wolverine claws and\nthese giant Popeye forearms. And they excavate ant and termite mounds, and they have this long tongue. And their baby's ride on their back for the first six months of their lives. And so they actually have this incredibly intimate relationship with their young, and it just so happened that this animal that I was wildly fascinated with, there was an orphan on the river, and JJ was like, \"You love these things?\" And I was like yeah. So he went and he was like,\n\"Hey, my friend, you should,\" he got me the baby. And we were, like, we're gonna rewild her. And so I spent like weeks\nand weeks and weeks just like with this thing on my back,\ncrawling through the jungle, teaching her to find\nants, giving her milk, falling asleep with her on my chest. And their tongue is like\n11 inches long at that age, and so when she wanted me to wake up, she'd fired up my nose and\nit would come out my mouth. And then if I tried to\nget her off me quick, she'd stick the claws in. And you know, on all my\nclothes I have old, you know, now they're like museum\npieces with rips in them from Lulu's claws. - She was able to also communicate emotion and feeling and all that. - She needed it, she needed it. So if this animal didn't\nhave the physical touch, if I didn't hold her all day long, she'd throw tantrums,\nshe'd go shred something, she'd go pull down the curtain,\nshe'd go ruin the woods. She'd start literally\nhaving traumatic response to not having intimacy,\nwhich was shocking, 'cause again, on the scale of\na cockroach to an elephant, you go, I didn't know that giant anteaters had such intense emotions, like, but she did. And also taking care of her forced me to explore the jungle from\nthe perspective of an animal. So I got to like be an animal. And so there's only a few\ntimes in your life, in my life where I've gotten to do\nthat, one was with her, another time was living\nwith the herd of elephants where I had to walk with them through the forest and like see how they interacted completely natural. And it's different, it's very different. And you realize like, just\nlike a person's public persona when they're out on the\nstreet in Manhattan, is gonna be very different than when you're on the couch\nwith them on a Tuesday night. And with wild animals\nit's very much like that. You know, like if you\nsee a bobcat on a trail, it's gonna look at you and\nglare at you and then go off. And it's like, yeah, but what's\nit like when it's in the den and it's playing with its cubs? - Yeah. So that when it's looking at you, that's like the Instagram\npost it's making. - [Paul] He's doing dark face. - Besides Amazon, you spend\na lot of time in India. Can you tell me what you learned hanging out with the herd of elephants? What do people not\nunderstand about elephants that's beautiful to you,\nthat's interesting to you? - First of all, I think the elephants should have government representation as like a subset of\nsociety, like, actually. - [Lex] They have intelligence? - They are so intelligent. And when you look at an elephant, so there's this question\nthat keeps coming up of, are we smart enough to\nknow how smart animals are? Can we interpret the\nintelligence that we're seeing? I lived with a semi-wild\nherd of elephants in India for a while, and some of the things that I saw changed how I view reality,\nto be honest with you. 'Cause you know, you watch a\nmatriarch of an elephant herd walk up to someone that\nnone of us knew was pregnant and her trunk goes to her stomach, and then she calls all\nthe other ones over. And they're interested\nin this little human that they know that\nthere's something in there. And they're all conversing\nabout it and you go, whoa. Or that every morning we'd wake up and the elephants didn't\nwant the stream water, they didn't want the lake\nwater, they didn't want puddles, they wanted the water from our well. We had like a stone well,\nyou know, like a traditional. And every morning we had to run outta bed 'cause all the elephants were gonna come and they were gonna rip the bucket off and destroy everything, but they wanted that\nnice cold, clean water. And so it was like caring\nfor elephants that were wild, that were sometimes\ngetting shot at by farmers, 'cause if they went to\ntry and rob some bananas. So these are sort of\nlike delinquent elephants that were half wild and the forest department\nwas thinking about, you know, getting rid of them,\nwhich, whatever that meant. I made really good friends\nwith this one elephant, his name was Dharma. And Dharma had the... It's hard to write the\nbook I'm writing right now because none of it sounds real. He grew up around people\nbecause he was a tuskless male, so he couldn't hang out with the females 'cause he was a grownup male, and he couldn't hang out\nwith the males, the bulls, because he couldn't defend himself when they roughhoused and everything. So, Dharma would be like\nwandering around the forest not knowing who to hang out with. And so like, there was one\nnight there was a tiger calling and we just heard (imitates tiger roaring) you could hear it echoing over the hills. And what does Dharma do? 2:00 AM, we hear Dharma show up. And same thing, he starts\nthrowing a tantrum, he starts pulling shit over, takes a chair, throws it. We had bananas in the truck. Dharma walks up to the\ntruck, it's like a jeep. He walks up to the jeep, smells it, he looks at me and he's like,\n\"Are you gonna get outta bed?\" I'm like, no, I'm not gonna get outta bed. I was like, \"Dharma, you're\na grown-ass elephant.\" The tiger does his thing again and he's like, \"I need\nbananas to feel better.\" Pushes the truck up on two wheels, looks at me, is this\nhow you want it to be? And so I'm up, I'm up. And I go and I'm like,\n\"Please, please, please.\" Dharma, I'm rubbing his face. And he's like, he puts it down. He's like, all right, well then hit me. I didn't do it, so he lifts it up again. And so in the end, there was no way for me to outsmart the elephant, he wins. There was nothing I could do. And so a lot of my job was\ntaking him out into the forest and you know, spending a\nlittle bit of time with him. I have this beautiful, one time I set up the tripod and I went, and I was just journaling. And he would come and he\nwould just play with my hair and he'd be like, \"Hey, what's up? He wanted someone to interact\nwith on an emotional level. And when you think about elephants in terms of the fact that, you know, people go, oh, they use medication to induce labor. It's like, yeah, that's\nnot that surprising. They hold the bones of the dead, it's like, yeah, they have the best smell of pretty much any animal, that's also not surprising. They probably know exactly\nwho that was, that bone. But they can navigate to waterholes and communicate in ways that\nwe cannot really figure out. And so when you hear about people measuring elephant intelligence, you'll hear about scientists being like, \"Oh well, we gave it a\nbucket with a hole in it, and then it had like a\nkey and there was a rope.\" And you're like, bro,\nthis is all human stuff. Can you go walking with them\nfor three weeks in the wild and watch how they deal with the problems that they encounter in the forest? And so elephants have become, especially recently with the work that I've been doing in Africa with VETPAW I've just become so\nfascinated with elephants. The African elephant population\nright now is down at 2% of what it was a few hundred years ago, we're really putting them\non the brink of, you know. There's some elephants that\nare being born tuskless because poaching has taken down the great tuskers to the point where now it's actually beneficial for some elephants to not have tusks 'cause then they won't have humans. That's like we've created\ndeformed elephants. And so now I'm gotten very concerned with issues of elephants. - And tusks are fundamental to the interaction between elephants? - Absolutely. I mean, when\nmales compete with each other, but also elephants use their tusks. They'll break a branch\nand they'll be like, \"This is a good branch, I'm\ngonna eat the hell out of this\" and they'll like hang it on their tusk, and they'll grab a bunch of other stuff, they'll like hold it. You know, ripping a tree\nup out of the ground. I just watched it. Two weeks ago, I was watching an elephant, he got down on his knees and\nstuck his tusk into the ground and like leveraged up. He, like, archimedes this\nroot out of the ground and then was like, that's a sweet root. And then when he left, I went, and I tasted the root and\nit was like sweet ginger. And I was like, I have\nno idea what this is but he knew it was good. - Do they use tusk for sexual selection? Like, to impress the ladies, or no? - It's certainly involved\nin who has mating rights. - [Lex] Oh, who wins in the contest. - I mean, if you got the big tusks, and there are elephants out there, like the mammoth, big tuskers that have tusks down to\nthe ground, like, huge. And when you see them,\nit's like seeing something unique on earth, unique in history 'cause we're at a point\nwhere we might lose those. There are only a few of them left and then they're so prized by hunters. - Yeah, it's interesting 'cause I forget what the actual conclusion on that is 'cause there's some studies of the use of the value of beauty in evolution, like birds and peacocks and so on, that there's no actual value to it but it plays a role in sexual selection. Meaning value, like, it's much easier to\nunderstand competition, like a tusk helps you\ndefeat the competitor. - [Paul] It's a tool. - But I bet you there's\na component to the tusk where the ladies go,\n\"Goddamn, that's a nice tusk.\" Like, there's a visual\nbeautiful component, maybe not, I don't know. - But what if beauty though, as we're defining it though, is symmetry and the absence of\nyellow spots on your face and healthy-looking hair. And so like, I think to us beauty is sexually-appealing traits\nthat look good to mate with. - So that 19-year-old with MRSA everybody in the world would\nswipe left on that. (chuckles) The least sexually desirable\nobject in the universe. Okay. Speaking of elephant intelligence and something I think\nand work quite a bit on, as with artificial intelligence, is what the philosophical\nquestion that comes up is what is intelligence? What is intelligent? Humans, homo sapiens are often thought to be highly intelligent, that's the reason they stand out. In your understanding of different species like the elephant, what stands\nout to you about humans? Or are they just another animal with different kinds of intelligence? - Well, we're certainly unique because we have altered the entire planet. You know, the term the Anthropocene, I mean, it's like we've literally created a geological layer of us, whereas other animals don't. And going back to elephants, it's like they also\nengineer their environment. If you're in a forest, like if you drop me in a forest on earth, I could tell you in two seconds\nif there's elephants there because there's twisted\nbranches and excavated earth, they're constantly gardening. But I mean, look at us. I mean we're clearly unique in nature, which makes me not understand\nthe anti-human sentiment that so much of\nenvironmentalism has about like we're bad, we're damned,\nwe ruin everything. And it's like, I've seen the worst, I've seen the burning\nAmazon and I'm still like, I love being able to share ideas with you and travel to places and FaceTime my family\nwhen I'm not around them. And it's like, I celebrate a\nlot of what makes us human. It's almost like reality\nis this crazy video game, and it's like if we could just\nfigure out the right keys, we can pretty much do\nanything we can think of. I mean, poetry, art, I mean, you know. I'm the biggest animal lover in the world, but we are different, we really are. - Yeah, the ability to\npuzzle solve, create tools. What do you think is the coolest invention humans have come up with? Is it fire? What's the most impactful? - I feel like fire is kind\nof a gimmy. I feel like the-- - [Lex] They didn't really\ninvent it, they probably-- - Like, the wheel, flying. I mean, flying. Think if you could go back in time to someone that never flew. You know, a saltan, an Egyptian king, George Washington, you know, and be like, you can fly. I mean, just on my way here, and I fly way too much, but I was looking out the\nwindow at the clouds and going, \"This is unbelievably\nspectacular. It's just stunning.\" You know, as a kid, you\nlook at a cloudy day and you go, \"The world\nis like this today.\" And then you get in a plane\nand you fly above the clouds and it's sunny up there and you go, oh. It changes your perspective, it's like when people go to\nthe moon and they come back and they tell you the pale\nblue dot, you know, just. I'd say flying, I think\nthe ability to fly. I mean the fact that I could\nget on a plane and be in India in 20-22 hours is shocking. - In terms of its usefulness, I would argue that's not in the top five, but in terms of its ability to inspire. There's somebody I forgot\nwho told me this idea that there's something about the\natmosphere, earth's atmosphere that allows you to look\nup and see the stars. Like if we didn't have that, human civilization\nwould not have happened, meaning like, being able to look up and see something out there. Like, something that allows you to look up versus just look down, looking at your local environment, be able to like wander and see, holy shit, there's a big world out there,\nand I don't know anything. If you're able to look up and see that, that kind of humility combined with the ability\nto dream about exploring, maybe it just inspires the exploration. It's kind of an interesting thought given how inspiring, for example, the extra upgraded super\ncool version of flying, which is flying to other planets. There's going to be,\nhopefully it's possible, this century, a child born, no, not this century, maybe this century, a child born on another planet that looks up and looks back at earth, has to be educated by his\nor her parents that like, there's another place. There's another place-\n- [Paul] That creeps me out. - where life is way easier. - [Paul] Oh God, it's so easy. There's water everywhere. - Yeah, exactly. People\ncomplain about earth, man, earth is really, really nice. - [Paul] It's really, really good here. - Water everywhere, anything. - Oh man, I wouldn't even leave. Given, like right now, if somebody said, like,\nyou could go to the moon, I'd be like, no, I'm good. If I died in space, I'd be so pissed. I love it here. - Yeah, but you're still, there's a longing to explore for you. - There's a longing to explore but I really think I'm such a... Like, my longing to explore is like river streams, oceans, jungles. - [Lex] Life.\n- Yeah. I would watch the hell\nout of the live stream of Elon touching down on Mars. Like, I'd be like, this is incredible, it's amazing that I get\nto be around to see this. I'm staying where, I'll be right here. - Yeah, but it's good that\nthe human spirit pushes us. - [Paul] Oh, it's amazing. - That it was possible. And it does that for you. Just a out-there question."

      "text": "What's the most dangerous\nanimal in the Amazon, would you say? Mammal, let's go with mammal. - [Paul] Dangerous mammal. - Like, dangerous in terms of you walking around doing the solo hike. - I'm gonna disappoint\neverybody with this, but it's humans. It's nothing, there's no... If I'm out in the Amazon, there's nothing that's going to attack me. And in India you might have an old leopard or a tiger that's missing a\ntooth that decides you're prey, or you might have an angry\nelephant that's in must that just decides to flatten you. In the Amazon, you're not, jaguars won't even let you see them, and there's really nothing else. One of my friends, a brilliant scientist friend of mine, Pat, got attacked by a rabid ocelot once, but that's like a diesel\nhouse cat just having a fit, you know, it wasn't the\nworst thing in the world. - Just the assholes of the animal kingdom. In terms of humans, you've said that the tribes, some of them uncontacted can be exceptionally dangerous. What's your experience with\nthem? What should people learn? Because it's such a\nfascinating part of life here on earth that there's\ntribes that don't have much or any contact with the quote, unquote \"civilized world.\" - Most of the people that\nI meet don't actually really understand how\nisolated these people are or how weird it is that we're sitting here and that we have iPhones and\nairplanes and all this stuff and these people are\nliving naked in the forest at this moment. The thing though, you know, and I also was recently somebody showed me all this\nlike paleolithic tribes, and it's like, no, no. Just by default they're\nmodern tribes living now, they just happen to be\nliving out in the jungle. And there's a huge debate about\ndo we try and contact them and bring them in? And there's two camps of people\non this who they say that it was the trauma of the\nrubber boom that sent them out that far into the forest\nand made them terrified of the outside world. And so that's also what\nmade them so hyper violent. One of the guys we work\nwith on our team, Victor, was in, I think it was 2004, he's coming downriver and he\nhad a load of mahogany wood. And he's piloting this boat. And he sent two people, husband and wife, ahead to go start cooking\nbreakfast on the beach so they could put the little\nkitchenette thing down and put the propane. He sent them ahead. He's going nice and slow with the barge coming down the river. They go ahead, reach\nthe beach, they get out, he starts cutting some cane\nto start making a fire. Tribe comes out, no warning,\nthey just start screaming, they start shooting arrows. The man instantly gets\nan arrow through the leg and it pins his leg so he can't run. He tells his wife, go, save yourself, and she does. She jumps in the water, there's arrows falling around her too. And as she's floating down the river, she looks back and the last\nthing she sees is these guys getting to her husband and\nbeginning to rip him apart. As Victor comes down the river, this is a guy we work with every day, he comes down the river\nand sees his friend disemboweled, opened up, dissected, his parts are all over the\nbeach, the beach is red. And they only found out what\nhappened because they found her later on holding onto a stick in the river and they were like, what happened? And she was like, \"They just attacked.\" They don't want people on their land. On the sort of the underground\nWhatsApp chain of the Amazon, a few, in August, like this was not internationally known, some loggers went up and\ntried to steal a few trees from where the tribes were. And then everybody sent the pictures of what the loggers looked\nlike after a few days because the tribes\nporcupined them with arrows. They were laying there on the ground with just arrows sticking\noutta their bodies. And then eventually the\nauthorities came out and looked, and there was just these white body, I'll show you the pictures later, there's just these white puffy bodies with like the skulls sticking out. And it was like, you don't\nmess with these tribes. - I wonder what's the mythology around, that they construct around\nwho these outsiders are? Are they gods, are they demons? Are they humans? Who are they? Who are we to them? - Well, you gotta go\nback to the rubber boom. The rubber barons went down there and at the start of the\nindustrial revolution, the only way to get rubber\nwas to mine it from the trees that are out in the forest. And so the only way to do that, 'cause you can't make a rubber\nplantation in the jungle. The rubber, when it's in plantation form, when it's a monoculture, it gets this leaf blight and it all dies. Henry Ford tried, it didn't work. And so what they did was\nthey sent these people down who just whipped, burned, enslaved, raped and pillaged the people. It's one of the worst\nperiods in human suffering that I've ever read about. One missionary said they\nwere killing the locals the way you or I would kill a mosquito. They just went nuts. And so they sent them out\nand they would come back with rubber and this would go to fuel the industrial revolution for\nhoses and gaskets and tires and all this stuff that\nsuddenly we needed. And it was during that\ntime that these, you know, gangs of foreigners\nwould go into the jungle to enslave the natives that these uncontacted tribes\nwent back into the jungle and said, \"Not us.\" And they have six-foot\nbows and seven-foot arrows with bamboo tips. They make the bamboo\ntips into razor blades. And so when those things fly, actually one of my rangers,\none of the Junglekeepers team was present when the tribes\nhad come out onto the river, and he tried to help them\n'cause they're nomadic and they live out there. And so there's an element of like brother, you know, they're trying to be like, you don't need to be like this, like, we're friendly. So they sent a canoe across\nthe river with bananas. And so he's up to his waist in the river and the tribes are right across the river. And they shot, and he sees the arrow coming right at his head. And as he moved to the side,\nit hit him at the temple and sliced them back towards the ear, opening him to the skull, he's fine. But let me tell you something, when he goes and gets a crew cut, it's the most badass scar\nyou've ever seen, man. And so he always keeps it\nreal short on that side. But even if you try to help them they're not necessarily friendly. - [Lex] That's a tough lesson. - Yeah. - [Lex] I suppose they have a point. - They have a point and\nprotecting them is a default of, you know, now that we're\nprotecting all this ecosystems and all these other\nindigenous communities, it's like we all sort of\nlive with this knowledge that they're the hermanos, the brothers are out there, and that's the way they want to keep it. And so we just have to\nbe respectful of like, you don't camp on certain beaches at certain times of the year because we know that they might be there. You really have to be careful about that. - Have you yourself interacted with any? - My interaction with them came on a solo where I pushed it a little bit too far. I was planning to do a three week, this was like the big one. I got dropped off by poachers up a river and I went past the point where\nthey were like names there. I said what tributary are we on? And they were like, \"Tributary.\" And I was like okay. And I said, \"Leave me here.\" And I remember the guy being like, \"Are you committing suicide?\" And he didn't understand that. I was like, \"No, I have a\nbackpack and I have food. I'm gonna like take videos\nand I have a tripod.\" And I was, like, we're cool here. They looked at me, like,\nthey were like, \"Goodbye.\" And I was like, \"All right.\" And I like went up this river. And again, you learn these\nthings like, you know, it was only when I'd been alone for a week that you realize you're, there's that saying, like, you're born alone and you die alone. It's like, no, you're not. You're born into a room\nfull of people usually, at the very least your\nmother's there for everybody. So you've been around people probably if you're a normal person\nevery single day of your life, you've seen dozens if\nnot hundreds of people. And all of a sudden you realize what a social creature we are, because on day six, it gets weird. For me, it got weird, I know there's people\nthat can do it longer. - So what does that mean? Like, longing for contact? Like, lonely? - Longing for contact,\nthe distortion of reality in the sense that like, you know, you wake up\nand there's no one there and you start to, you know, you're going up a river. I kept looking back downriver and almost thinking of\nmy life as something, it was almost like I had already died and I had gone to somewhere else, and I was looking back\non that life as like something that I had experienced. And then there came this\npanic of, what if it's gone? Or like, what if World War III broke out and I just don't know about it? My family in New York is\nvaporizing. Something. - So actually, your ability to comprehend and interpret reality kind\nof requires other people. It's not just that you're lonely, you need that contact to\nactually just perceive the world, makes sense of it, all of that, so you start basically hallucinating in a certain kind of way. - I started feeling very uncomfortable. And it doesn't help also that, like, Santiago told me these\nstories where he's like, \"If you hear capuchins\nsounding not quite monkeys, if you hear capuchin monkeys sounding not quite like capuchin,\" he goes, \"It's the tribe and\nthey're coming to get ya.\" And then, so the guy\nwho was shot, Ignacio, they showed me videos where\nwe saw them on the beach and they're communicating in monkey calls. They're using it as code so\nthat we don't understand them, even though we don't speak their language. But they're using animal calls. And so every night you go\nto sleep and then you go, did that tinamou sound off? And you're like, \"Shit.\""

      "text": "You know, and it's really\nhard to fall asleep. And then one night, I messed up, and I left a fish. I cleaned this fish, I\nate like this huge fish, I just ate it to my face. You're putting out marathon\nlevels of energy every day, like, you know, Goggins would love solos. He'd be like, \"This is awesome.\" - Do you eat fish raw? - This one I actually cooked it. But the skeleton was laying there right outside my tent, stupid. And in the middle of the night I wake up, I just could tell there\nwas something there, you know, and then you\nalmost don't wanna look. It's like when you're a\nkid at the basement door and you're like, is there a ghost? I unzipped the tent, and I open it up, and\nthere's like 27 black caiman outside of my tent all\nlooking at me like this. And some of their heads are\nthis big and they're like, \"This fish there, can we have it?\" And I'm like, \"Holy shit.\" I kind of like had to scooch the tent back and move back and let\nthem have their fish, and there was a host of\ncrocodiles outside of my tent. But no, so then there was--\n- Wait, how many? - Like 27, maybe? There was a lot. Big ones, small ones, medium-sized one, every type were all there. Their eyes glow in the night. You know, you shine a light at animals and they have a tapetum lucidum and so their eye shine comes back at you. If you shine a headlamp\nat a jaguar or a frog, almost every animal has a tapetum. - There's a croc, there's\na whole lot of them. Can we go back to the\npart of the conversation where you said the\njungle is not dangerous, the humans are the most dangerous? - Well, did they eat me? No. - [Lex] Why didn't they eat you? - They wanted the fish. - Is there some way of\nyou interacting with them that shows that you're not source of harm? - I don't believe so. I'm sure there's someone out there that thinks they can talk to crocs, but. - Because there's a story\nof you grabbing a croc by the tail. What did you learn from that? - [Paul] Learned to not\nalways listen to JJ. - So JJ was testing you. - Yeah, to see how stupid it was. - [Lex] How do you hold\nthe crocodile exactly? - You have to get 'em by the head, like an anaconda, like this. - So you're one of the world experts of grabbing creature by the head? - I wouldn't say world expert,\nbut I've done a lot of it. I also have, you see how there's\nlike kind of a ball there? That's where a crocodile\ntooth went in that side and came out that side. That was a really good chomp. And the watch I was wearing\nat the time saved me, 'cause that (imitates\ncrocodile snapping) like that. - [Lex] Just real fast, just chomp. - Just whack. Like, somebody\ntook a sledgehammer, you put your hand on the table and it just went (imitates\nsledgehammer slamming). Really hurt, shouldn't\nhave been doing that. - [Lex] How did that come up? - Because I caught a\ncroc that was too big. So usually when we catch\nlittle caiman in the streams and we measure them to\nmonitor the populations, you get it by the neck and then I tuck the tail\nunder my arm and I hold it. And you're talking about a little, you know, four-foot croc, nothing. This one, I dove into a swamp, and I caught like a\nsix-foot spectacle caiman. And her head was big, and\nI had her by the neck. And I realized I couldn't\nget her tail under my arm 'cause her tail was all the way back there and she started thrashing. And it was like probably croc\nnumber 375 that I'd caught, and I just got a little\ncocky and I said, \"Haha.\" You know, I just like\ngrabbed her by a leg, I was like I got this. And she just came back and tagged me. And I went, okay, gonna\ngo back to being safe. - Just to linger on it. Is it one of the bigger\npredators in the Amazon? Are they going extinct? Black caimans? - Black caimans were, I believe, they were critically\nendangered for a while because for a while the fashion\nindustry loved their skin, it's soft and it's black. They're bouncing back a little bit now. Like, most animals, if\nyou leave them alone, they'll be fine. I mean, crocs have been through, you know, how many millions and millions\nof years on earth before us. I mean, that's even\nthe joke with the joke, but that's the grim reality\nof tiger conservation. There was 100,000 tigers in 1900, now there's 4,000 tigers left on earth. It's not rocket science. All you have to do is\nnot bulldoze their forest and allow there to be some\ndeer and tigers will be fine. That's it. It's so simple. And that's like sometimes\nwhere I feel like I have the dumbest job in the world. I'm like, guys, please\nstop killing the things that keep us alive. The Amazon regulates our global\nclimate, produces medicine, it's home to indigenous\npeople, it's beautiful. Rainforests only cover 3%\nof the planet's land mass, like, it's not that much to ask. - If you leave their home untouched, they'll figure out how\nto have sex and multiply. Except for pandas, apparently, 'cause pandas you have to convince. - Yeah. Humpbacks, they went down to, they went from 130,000 down\nto, I think, about 8,000 at wailing times. And then when we banned\nwailing, since that time, I think we're back up to\nover 100,000 humpback whales. They've bounced back,\nit's a success story. We're not gonna lose 'em. - Okay. So you're on a solo, with the crocs looking at you. - See, this is why you're good at this. I would've lost, we would've\nbeen on tangent forever. - [Lex] That's pretty epic with the fish, that was your mistake. - That was my mistake, the fish. - I don't understand\nhow you're still alive. (Paul laughs) It's really inspiring. - When you come, I'm gonna show you. You told me you're coming earlier. - Hundred percent coming,\nyeah, but you know. (both chuckles) If there's any place, I mean, sort of a grim joke, but if there's any way to\ndie, that's a good one, if I'm being honest. - [Paul] It's a cool one. - It's a pretty cool one. - [Paul] You'll become part of the- - Part, yeah. I'm not even joking, there's a oneness to the whole thing. All the stories, just reading your work, looking at your work, it seems like you are a part\nof this machine that is nature, this incredible machine. Like, we all die and we're\nall part of this big thing that humans do have the capability to also construct narratives\nand stories and myths and tell 'em to each other and share them with each other and have more sophisticated ways therefore to communicate\nlove to each other, but animals do as well. They communicate love, maybe more simply, maybe more honestly. Anyway, so you were with\nthe crocs and the fish. - Yeah. So I messed up,\nI left the fish out, crocs showed up outside my tent. But in the end it was fine. I backed off, they had\ntheir way with the fish, and then they all started\nbiting each other, it was fun to watch. - Is that a general, sorry to interrupt, is that a general rule,\nyou want to not leave food? - Yeah, just like if you're\ncamping in the northeast, you don't leave like, you do\na bear bag or a bear canister, you don't want to invite the wild animals. I really did mess up, I kind of was just like,\nyou know, whatever, I do this every now and then,\nI get a little too cavalier, and the ocean has almost taken\nme down for that a few times. But yeah, so the crocs, and then you keep going for a few days. And my plan was to get to a point where I reached the end of the tributary. And this had a very... You know, again, for me,\nthis is like a pilgrimage. This is like me going into the heart of the very center and soul\nand essence of everything that I am fascinated with, like, as close to God as you can get because you're leaving\nevery type of security, every human relationship, you're also pushing all your chips in. Every step I took further upriver, it got weirder and\nweirder and more intense. And every day and every moment it changed. I brought pictures, and at the time, there's no\nway to keep a phone charged, I didn't have like a\npower bank or anything. You know, I brought pictures from home. I brought a National Geographic magazine, something just to, you know. And there came a day right\nwhen I was getting to the end, like to the point where the\nriver was so shallow that it was just a trickle. And I was walking on the rocks and the Andes mountains\nwere in front of me. And I was like reaching the place and the music was swelling, and then all of a sudden I saw\nsmoke around the next bend. Like, my spine is reacting\nright now as I talk about it because I knew what I was gonna see 'cause I knew that it was\nimpossible for loggers to be out there, there's no motor that could take you, the boat would've run a ground miles ago. And so, I went. This is the other idiot thing. It's like, just turn around. Just do it. I'm that kid though when you\nsee like a wet paint sign, like I walk by and I touch the wall. And so I went around the bend and I see a few naked people on the beach and they see me. And we're like a good distance apart, they're on the other side of the river. But, you know, arrow in hand, bow in hand. The intention of pose,\nthey're looking at me, they're clearly conversing. And that moment lasted for a long moment where I said, \"This is\nthe part of the story where they are going to rip me apart, dissect me to see what I eat.\" I mean, every other story in\nthe region that we've heard, that's the ending of it. If you're alone with these people, it's not gonna go well, and I have nothing to defend myself with. And I turned and I ran\nfor like three hours and I got in the river\nand I swam for a while. And all my food got\nwet, I mean everything. - [Lex] Just ran for dear life. - Just ran for dear life. And my get out plan, the thing after I crossed the mountains and came down into the next\ntributary was I had a pack raft. It's a tiny little inflatable raft, good enough to handle rapids. And I inflated the pack\nraft once the river was like six inches deep, I inflated the pack raft and I went. And I went for the rest of\nthat day into the night, I went into the point\nthat my headlamp died and I was just floating\nin a raft down the Amazon and hitting into things. And then I was like, okay,\nI'm gonna pop this raft. So I got out of the raft, set up my tent, and I was like, I need some\nsleep, I was freaking out. I hadn't had food in\nhours and hours and hours. As soon as I fell asleep, my asshole brain comes\nup with the dream of that I hear voices, they're\nright outside the tent. Sleeping was worse than being awake. So I woke up, got back in the tent, and then at one point it was really cool 'cause one of the same\nblack caiman that had come for the fish as I'm going downriver, he came right up next to me\nand the two of us were going and he was just like motoring downriver, this giant, like, 16-foot crocodile. He just came up to me and\nlooked at me as I was going. And it was funny 'cause\nI wasn't scared of him, I was scared of them. And yeah, it took me like\na week to get back to town. And again, the things you\nlearn in these moments, the appreciation for your parents, what a hug feels like. When you are faced with\npretty much certainty that you're not gonna\nget those things again, whether it's from MRSA or uncontacted tribes or, you know. I find that it brings you this\nnew joy for life where you-- - [Lex] Just being that close to death. - Yeah. You go, \"My god,\nthis is all a miracle.\" - It's sad because they're\nhuman just like you. Actually, how different are they? Like, if you were forced to\ninteract for a week together, where they can't, they're\nnot allowed to kill you. - [Paul] Not allowed to kill me. - How fundamentally different\nare they, do you think? - I don't think they're different, I think they're like any\nother Amazonian natives. They're tall, they seem\nto have tall genetics. And there's places, you know, again, there's what is known and then there's what we know down there. Like, there's one community where, I don't know whether it\nwas like a bad rainstorm or something, but some kid\nfrom the uncontacted tribes did end up in a village. And so he learned Spanish, or he learned whatever dialect\nthey speak in that village. And so he's told us a little bit about what life was like with them. But like, they're just\npeople. They're just people. They have their own culture, they know about medicines\nthat we don't know about. They definitely have hunting practices that we don't understand. They can hit a spider\nmonkey out of 160-foot tree with a bamboo arrow, we can't do that. I mean, they are incredible hunters. And also like, living naked in the jungle with the botflies and the mosquitoes, I don't know how they do it. Like, sometimes at night, and again, we don't have night vision, whereas almost every other animal does. And sometimes we'll be sitting, you know, at the research station at night and we'll be just drinking\nand like looking out, you know, we'll scare each other. We'll go, you realize if they\nwere out there right now, they could be looking at us. And it's like, the truth is is that when it's dark out there, they can't see, it's not easy to start a fire with matches in a lighter and gasoline, they do it with friction. They have some beads on survival that we could really learn from. Not to mention that then you\nhave people that believe that they're actually the guardians of the extinct giant ground sloth, and what they're doing is living out there because they're protecting\na secret population of previously extinct megafauna. But there's all kinds, I mean, it's like you go into\nthe crypto world so quick I've heard so many people be like. - But then again, you have to be humble at how little we know about that world, about the world of life. Like, you said, there's so\nmuch of life in the Amazon that we don't, creatures with no names. - Tons of 'em. We could go out on a night walk right now and I could show you\nsomething that, you know. I've done it. You pick\nup a bug and you go, \"That doesn't look right. That's not right, he's got three heads.\" You know, and then you send\nit to the greatest expert on that genus of insects. And they go, \"Look, I got no idea,\" and you're talking to a world expert. And it's like, that's it. And 50% of the life is up in the canopy. And so like, we started\nclimbing the trees, like rock climbing, like\nwhat Alex Honnold does. I'll climb up 50 feet and\nthen I'll put a safety, like I'm basically trad climbing. And then I'll climb up another 50 feet and I'll have JJ belaying me from below. And then he'll be like,\n\"Ooh, look a snake.\" I'm like, \"JJ, pay attention.\" Like, to get up there and the branches are\nas thick as this table so you can walk around freely. It's like total like \"Avatar\" when they're in the floating islands. You can go run around\nif that's what you want. Bromeliads, orchids, cactuses, because up there it's against the sun so it's a different environment up there. - [Lex] Oh wow, interesting. - And then you start seeing\nlizards and snakes and birds and things that aren't down on the ground. And so how many scientists\nhave actually gotten to really spend time up there\nand really inventory the life? And that's why when you hear about, and it's like a taxonomical discussion of how many species they're on earth. They're like between 10 and 30 million. And it's like, well that's a big swing. - What about stuff on the ground? So you mentioned some insects. What about bullet ants? So it's supposed to be the\nmost painful bite in the world. You've been bitten by one? - Seven or eight times, yeah. - Cool. What does it feel like? - Okay, so the first time\nthat we ever did bullet ants, JJ said, you know, okay, this is what we're gonna do. He goes, you know, it's\nbullet ant roulette. We're gonna get a bullet ant and you're gonna get like chopsticks. You like, pick up this\nbullet ant, and they're big, they're big and they're tough. He goes, \"We're gonna\nput our forearms together and we're gonna drop the bullet ant and clamp our forearms\ntogether and just rub. And whoever it takes, it takes.\" Of course, JJ did not get stung and I did. And it hurts every bit as\nmuch as they say it hurts, it really let me have it. And then I was like hitting\nmy arm against the table to try and kill it or get it off. But it was holding on and just like really injecting the venom. And yeah, really letting you have it. And then it travels up and\nit goes into your lymph nodes and into your here and you get a headache. And I think the brilliant thing about the venom of a bullet ant\nis that it makes you feel like this feeling of alarm, it makes you feel like something's wrong. You don't just go, \"Ow, this hurts\" like it's like a bee sting, where you \"Ah, this\nreally hurts on my hand.\" It's like, no, no, no, no. Your whole nervous system is freaking out and you start sweating\nand then you get cold and then you're tired and then you get a little blurry vision. And it's like, yeah\nthat's actually that bad. I mean now after six or seven I get bitten and I'm like kind of okay. - [Lex] So it's a full\nbody, full mind experience. - It's a full body, full mind experience. But then there's places in the\nAmazon where they, you know, stick their hand in a\nglove with like 70 of them. And I think Steve-O did that, which I just don't understand\nhow you could do that without going into complete\nanaphylactic shock and dying 'cause one really sucks. - Well just like we said, with animals and with humans\nthere's different kinds. - [Paul] There's different kinds. - Steve-O is definitely, specially unique. - [Paul] The first of its species. - Whew."

      "section": "Graham Hancock and ancient civilizations",
      "text": "On the point of uncontacted tribes, it's interesting to think about what kind of civilizations\nhave there been? This is something that you've\ntalked about a little bit. Graham Hancock has written about ancient civilizations and sort of challenging the conventionals or the mainstream thinking\nabout the civilizations that have been there in the Amazon. Can you steelman and criticize the idea, so the pro and the con of the idea that there have been ancient, advanced ancient\ncivilizations in the Amazon? Like, how much do we know? Or what are all the possibilities\nof what's in the Amazon in its past? - So like, when Orellana\nwent down the Amazon, the reports were that there\nwas great civilizations in the Amazon. And then, you know, a\nfew hundred years later when people got to actually\ncheck up on this stuff, it was all gone. And so was that because of disease that we wiped out all these civilizations and these communities of people? Potentially, probably. Was he just wrong? Probably not. This is a guy that navigated\nby the stars back to Spain after building his own\nboat. Or did he, you know? Or was he trying to just,\nI don't know. I don't know. But there clearly is a long history of complex civilizations in the Amazon. A hundred percent, there's\nno one that can deny that. The thing that I reacted to was that I've heard videos, I've seen\nmoments in podcasts where the narrative becomes not, there's more ancient civilization\ninformation in the Amazon than we previously\nthought, true statement. We're discovering with lidar, and this is what Graham\nHancock is talking about, that we're discovering constantly that there is more civilizations\nthan we thought in various places. The place where I take offense is where they start to\nsay that the Amazon, there's actually articles\nthat are titled this, that the Amazon is a manmade garden, which is not true. - So the actual, which I think\nis a really different idea that the entire ecosystem, everything we've been talking\nabout, all the species, all the forestry and the\ndifferent, just life, life, one of the most\ndiverse ecosystems on earth is initially created by humans. - It's ridiculous. - Well, it's not. First\nof all, it's unlikely, but it's not ridiculous. So we can't, there's no\nridiculous in science. - [Paul] No. - But the complexity of life\nis very difficult to engineer the more you study about\nbiological systems and so on, it's very difficult to\ncreate the kind of things that nature is able to do. That said, I don't know if you've heard, but the entire earth, the world has gone through\na pandemic recently. And everybody said of\ncourse it's natural origins, viruses mutate all the time. And nevertheless, it\nseems more and more likely in this particular case, it was of an artificial\norigin, leaked from a lab. So humans are able to create stuff, at least modern technological\ngenetic engineering. - We made golden retrievers. Come on. - You can't be that nice\nand that good looking. It used to be a wolf, yeah. So that bothers you because\nit allows you to think that we don't need to preserve the Amazon, we can always engineer it. - Yeah, exactly. This is just to me,\nthat's a slippery slope. It's so quick from, I'm a fan of expeditions\nto find ecological ruins and to learn more about the\nancient civilizations to, which I don't think is what\nhe's putting out is that, then sort of like news articles, which I think they're trying to bait you, where they're going,\nwas the Amazon manmade? And it's like, you know. Because then you get a\nBrazilian president that go, \"See? See what they said? It's manmade. So we might as well continue\nto engineer it and manage it.\" And it's like, there's such\ncomplex systems and interactions and such a giant web of life there that, at least in my opinion, is clearly one of the most\nauthentically natural things. And again, are there things\nthat we've engineered, the uncontacted tribes,\nsometimes they have banana plants that they've stolen and we\ncould see it from the air that they have banana plants. We've made banana plants,\nthat's engineered by us, we know for a fact. - [Lex] Agricultural engineering. - Agricultural engineering\nand stuff like that. But suggesting that the\nAmazon basin, you know, it's just a weird way to think about it. I've just heard people dismiss\nthe protection of the Amazon based on the fact they're like,\noh well, if people made it, and it's such a giant leap\nfrom zero to a hundred. Is there slash and burn that\nthe ancient civilizations did? Of course. Are there areas that were\naffected by people? Of course. I just get worried when\nwe start talking about it was a man-made thing. - Yeah, here you loud and clear on that. And I personally think\nthat's completely separate"

      "text": "from wondering about what\nthe ancient civilization have been able to accomplish. It's almost really sad because\nif all the humans on earth die now, how long does it take before all signs of humans ever existing disappear for the most part, from an alien perspective? - What timeline are we talking about? I mean, like a hundred thousand years? - It could be less, it could be less. It could be like a few thousand because a hundred thousand\nis complete destruction. - [Paul] Hundred thousand is like nothing. - But then it could be in\njust a few hundred years, it starts becoming, the government of the alien\ncivilization is gonna have to pay quite a bit of money\nto do the research to find, 'cause they're gonna\nfind other life first. They're gonna find the dolphins\nand the fish and so on. They're gonna find the trees, maybe the trees are the interesting thing. The buildings are not that\ninteresting without humans. They crumble.\n- But there must be examples of cities that have been left unattended for a few\ndecades and like how quickly the plants push up through the street and everything starts to get broken down. - If you really look, you'll be like, oh, there's some interesting geometry here for the buildings and so on. But most of the computer stuff, all the stuff of the past hundred years, the airplanes, all of\nthat, all the technologies, all of the paperwork, all the hard drives that\nstore all the information. - I want to actually\nknow how long it takes like a 747 to biodegrade. Like, if you just leave it\nthere sitting on the runway, society stops, how long does it take for\nthat thing to disappear? Like, that's a weird one. - Completely versus to a point\nwhere it's unidentifiable might be different, but. I mean, the point I'm\ntrying to say here is, as you've brilliantly\nput, the Amazon churns. - [Paul] Yeah, oh yeah. - And the fact there, I wonder throughout its history, what are the peaks of the awesomeness? How many banana, how many agricultural Einsteins of bananas were there? They're creating different kinds of ideas, different kinds of geometries,\ndifferent kinds of tools. - Well, yeah, look what the Incas did. I mean the Incas, you know, Machu Picchu. When Hiram Bingham found Machu Picchu, it was covered in jungle, you could hardly see it. And I mean the stonework they did, much like what the Egyptians\ndid with the pyramids, a lot of it we don't really\nunderstand how they did it. If you come to the jungle, you gotta go to Machu Picchu\n'cause it's not far from there. And I usually, like, I'm the person, like, I don't usually go see like the, you know, I've never been to see the Taj Mahal after living in India for\nfive years, like I'm just not. But when you look up and you\nsee Machu Picchu, you go, either they were communicating\nwith the gods there or these people were\nso smart that they knew that anybody they brought,\nthey were gonna impress. They've built something there that when you look up at that\nmountain, you go, \"Whoa,\" with those giant stones,\nthe beauty of it, you know. It's just stunning to imagine that there was this culture of people that could achieve this. And so through the Amazon, I mean that's sort of up in the Andes, but there's all kinds\nof stuff in the Amazon. There are places where\nthey say there's pyramids beneath the canopy that\nwe just don't know about. I mean, it's endless. - If you had billions of\ndollars, trillions of dollars, what would be the efforts in the Amazon, for both conservation and for exploration? Which are tied together. - Yeah, exactly. First,\narrest the deforestation so we don't have an ecological\ncrisis on our hands. We don't wanna keep losing species, losing indigenous cultures, losing the climate stabilizing services that the Amazon provides as a whole. Stop that, that's my first mission. Next, then we can play. And then it's like, let's go find, I mean, I've flown over\nthe Amazon in a Cessna and it's like, you see\nthings where you go, we have to go see what that is. You know, weird lakes, or shapes in the jungle\nthat don't make sense that are strange. - So even at that level,\nyou can see weirdness, you can see different, like,\nsigns of possible awesomeness. - Oh, the jungle is so weird. And here's the other thing is that most, so like the region I've been working in, you see where the researchers go. There's certain biological stations, there's certain places where like, oh, this university has\na relationship with this, this university with this. So everybody goes to the\nsame few study sites, and then they walk on the same trails and they have the same guides. When you fly in a Cessna and you fly a few hours away from all that and you see a tiny little tributary, and then you fly for 40\nminutes over unbroken green, just wild, before you\nreach another tributary. Even if somebody could survive\ngoing up that tributary, had the expeditionary expertise\nand the ability to survive getting shot at by arrows, if they could get up that tributary, now cut perpendicular into\nthe jungle, which I don't do. On the solos, you can never,\ndon't ever leave the river. But you're telling me that\nin that span of 70 miles between tiny tributaries\nat the edge of the world, no one's been there, none\nof us have been there. You know, maybe somebody\n10,000 years ago was there, but we don't know what\npopulations of things are there, we don't know what ruins are there. And so there's so much\nundiscovered stuff in the Amazon that is just waiting, just waiting. - What is the process of exploring that? So how does money get\nconverted towards exploration? Is there safe ways of doing that? - There's places where, you know, we've found out about things\nthat have to be explored. You come up with, well how do we do this without getting shot. And not only without getting shot, but also without endangering them too, 'cause how stupid are we if we go in there to people that are living in\nthe jungle, not bothering us, and we go insert ourselves into there because we're curious about some rocks. That doesn't seem fair for\nthe loss of life, and so like. But yeah, that's something\nthat we're working on. And one thing of course\nis like lidar and stuff, but eventually, at the end of everything, it comes down to boots on the ground. - As somebody who has to\nask that very question about how to deal with uncontacted tribes, they're going to kill you, but you also don't wanna\ndisturb their environment. If you were an intelligent\nalien civilization - [Paul] Oh boy. - and you came about earth, how would you interact with it? Can you put yourself in the\nmind of an alien civilization? 'Cause there seems to\nbe some parallels here. - [Paul] That is actually right,\nit's like a microcosm of... - We're very aggressive, human civilization is very aggressive. So if we were easily, we get threatened easily\nfor stupid reasons, 'cause we start, like, American military probably thinks it's like the Chinese or the Russians if we see any kind of flying objects, it gets very on edge. - I don't know, I mean. 'Cause you know, part of it is like, you just want to ask. Like that's the thing, I\njust want to ask questions. - Yeah, but you don't\nknow the same language. - [Paul] What you gonna get? First of all--\n- You send a boat of bananas. - You send a boat of\nbananas, you get shot. I mean picture if aliens\nlanded in New York, how long would it take for\none of them to get shot? It'd be minutes, it'd\nbe matter of minutes. - [Lex] Yeah, but that's\n'cause it's New York, and everywhere else. - Look where we are right now. (chuckles) - That's true, it'd be\neven worse here, yeah. Makes me wonder what is the\nright way to interact with intelligent life that's not like our own. I dream of in our lifetime\nwe would interact with possibly life on Mars or on one of the moons\nof Jupiter or Saturn. And like, how do you\ninteract with that thing? This very technical, biological\nand chemical processes, but also if there's any\nkind of intelligence, how do you try to communicate\nwith that intelligence? - So we're not talking\nabout like a cockroach, we're talking about like some\nsomething that's clearly like doing things, making things. - Well, cockroach, possibly. How do you know the difference\nbetween a cockroach? Like, how do you know? We were just talking\nabout those elephants. We don't know, we don't know. - Just like a race of like\nphilosopher cockroaches just chilling on the rocks. - Well, here on earth we kind of, there seems to be a strong correlation between size and intelligence. It seems like the bigger things\nhave bigger nervous systems and brains and so they're usually smarter, but that doesn't. - I think it's the ratio, brain to body, 'cause you have like crows that are up among the most intelligent. And it's like the size of the\nbrain to the size of the body. - But there also could\nbe kinds of intelligence who we're completely,\n- [Paul] That we have no idea. - we're not appreciating. Maybe cockroaches, they've\nsurvived the longest. They're talking about us\nright now, this dumb humans. - [Paul] Like, dude.\nThese rocks are so great. - A couple of hundred years, exactly. - Did you hear that Kurt Vonnegut where the two space travelers get lost? This really impacted me as a kid 'cause my dad was an English teacher so he is always quoting\nDostoevsky and Kurt Vonnegut. And there's this two space travelers get crash landed in a cave. And on the walls of the\ncave are the Harmoniums, and these kite-shaped animals and they feed off the\nvibrations of the cave. And that's all they do, they don't hurt each\nother, they just do that. And so for like two years,\nthese travelers are stuck and they're trying to fix their ship. One of them starts playing\nmusic for the Harmoniums, and the Harmoniums love him for the music and they all come around him and he plays this music for him. And finally they fix the ship. And the one guy is like, \"All\nright, let's get outta here.\" And the other guy's like,\n\"You know what, I'm staying.\" He goes, \"I found a place\nwhere I can do good. I'm not hurting anybody and they love me. I'm staying right here.\" - Yeah, this whole ambition\nthing we've got going on, always trying to build the\nbigger boat, bigger thing, that might not be the ultimate conclusion of a happy existence as a civilization. That's one of the possibilities\nwhy we haven't met the aliens yet at scale. 'Cause once you get good\nenough at technology, you realize that happiness\nlies in a peaceful coexistence. It's possible. - So where do you stand\non like aliens now? Like, there's a lot coming\nout about the pilots and the things people have been seeing. And again, I kind of come\nin and out of this stuff, like I'll be in the\njungle for three months. I miss a lot, so like, update me. Are we being contacted right now? - Of course nobody knows,\nbut I tend to believe. My intuition says there's\naliens everywhere, even our galaxy. That's a bigger leap\nbut I believe our galaxy has probably billions, hundreds of millions of\nplanets with life on it, like bacteria type of life. And I believe there is, I don't know, thousands of intelligent\nalien civilizations that exist or have existed. The problem is there's a lot of time, and it's very difficult\nto contact each other. So to achieve a kind of\ncivilization that's able to actually send out enough signal or radiate enough energy\nwhere we would notice, I think that's really tough. That said, statistically speaking, it seems like that\nshould have been possible inside our galaxy or maybe nearby. And so, I suspect that once an alien civilization is\njust many orders of magnitude smarter than us humans, the way it would contact us is going to be very difficult\nfor us humans to understand. We're very ego-centric. We want the message to be\nsent as like a, in English, versus, you know, I think\nconsciousness itself, emotion, thoughts, could be like fingertips, could be words in the story\nthat aliens are telling us, or things that are just like a low-dimensional projection of a much higher dimensional message that's being sent by aliens. And that maybe are striving\nto create technology is to create the kind of sensor that's actually able to\nhear some of the message, maybe that's what AI is trying to do. So I think that bridging\nthat barrier of communication between us and cockroaches, I think that's the biggest challenge. - [Paul] Interesting. - Like, the messages are\nall around us, they're here. I suspect that the\nalien messages are here. The aliens are here, we're\njust too dumb to see it. - So first of all, the imagining planets\nwhere there are, like, just picturing, not a silent planet, but just like a planet\nof alternate life forms. You know, maybe it's not\nsomething that we can communicate and have a conversation with, but just a planet of like\nbutterflies and centipedes and weird, you know, things. - Unfortunately, bacterias,\nfor billions of years, it was bacteria as single cell, prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but they're boring, but yeah. - Animals of some sort in\nan environment of some sort. Imagine that, it would just\nbe such an interesting, beautiful, amazing thing,\nand I'm sure they're out. On that, I'm yeah. - The kind of viruses they got going on. But they could also not\nbe biologically based, they could be different chemistry so you have to be humble to that too. - [Paul] Sure. - But then, you know,\nit depends on the day. Like, I think you caught\nme on that day today, an optimistic one. Sometimes I think we're all, this is all there is because\nyou ask that question the fermi paradox, like,\nwhy aren't they here? You can't imagine an\nadvancing civilization that would not be explorers,\nbecause we're explorers. - Why is that depressing to you? The idea that... Let's just say you\nfound out right now that there isn't anything else. Let's just say that\nfor example's sake that the earth is the earth and\nthe universe is the universe, and it's sort of like the\nbackdrop of a video game, and it's just what's out there. Would that be tremendously\ndepressing to you? - I think it's exciting for an engineer, it's probably exciting for an explorer. But I would equate that\nto your going out hiking for three days with one match. It kind of terrifies me\nthat we only got one match. - Really?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Really? - Yeah, one. All you got is one match. No, no, no, hold on a\nsecond. Hold on a second. Paul, wait a minute. You're going out, there's no more matches, this is the only match you got. - But no one's gonna\nextinguish the planet. Like there's not, as far as we know, there's no meteor coming. I'm saying like, do you live in a, so what I'm saying is that is your worry then that we\nneed to have a backup plan? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Really? So what if we do mess it up so bad that we can't live here anymore? - Well, there's different\nways to mess it up. There's ways to mess it up to\nmake life really difficult. - [Paul] You have \"Mad\nMax\" type of things. - But there's nuclear war with a further and further\nadvancement of technology that can destroy all of our, it just feels like that's going\nto be exponentially growing. - [Paul] Yes, it's gonna get worse. - Listen, I'm very optimistic, but it's a heck of a Russian\nroulette we're playing. - Okay. But I'm still curious\nabout your intention though, or like where your passion\nfor this comes from. Or maybe it's both, but is it the need to have a backup plan for humans, which is admirable for your\nintense love of humanity and our consciousness and\nlove and art and everything, or is it also just that\nthe raw fascination of imagining what's out there? Because the way you said that about like, oh, you caught me on a positive\nday where I think it's, there was something in\nthere that made me think that you need there to be. - Ah, yeah. I think I'm the kind of person that sees beauty in everything, but to me, a universe full of diverse life is more beautiful than one\nwhere it's just humans. It's just the earth life. - [Paul] Interesting. - There's more beauty. I mean, I'm not egotistical\nabout the awesomeness of humans. I like if humans are not the smartest in our galaxy, or not even\nclose to being the smartest. And that to me is, I don't know. That that to me is exciting\nabout the possibility of what the universe can create. - Yes, I'm with you on that, that it's wildly exciting to... Like if we found, even if it was just a distant inkling that we found out that there\nis a planet that has life. There's no communication coming from it, but we know for a fact\nthere's stuff going on there. It would just change how we\nthink about our entire reality. We know now. - And it could be, to me, I guess the little\ninkling of a thing, that is depressing. If all there is is earth and humans destroy it, then we are the coolest thing that the universe has\never created. (chuckles) It's over. - I'm interested to\nhave this conversation. I'm really, I'm saying like, I would be interested to\nbring you to the jungle. Now I'm also wondering, I'm wondering like what your\nwilderness experience is because I feel like for me, I'm so earth-centric to\nthe point where I'm like, we differ in that. For me, this is, like, it's a curiosity. I feel wonder and I feel\nit's fun to talk about like what's at the edge of space, like, you know, there's the\nconundrums of space time. To me I'm like, what if the aliens are watching us, or what if the aliens aren't watching us? But what if the challenge here\nis we've been put on earth as the most intellectually\ncomplex of these creatures and we're being observed\nto see how we manage it. And it's like, we haven't made a good job of managing each other. You know, before Orellana\nwent down the Amazon they showed up and just sacked the Incas. I mean, read our history, I\nmean, I don't have to tell you, just got back. Sometimes I wonder, you know, is there a grand narrative with what we're doing to wildlife? Because it's like we have\nall these other species and we're struggling even\nhere in this conversation to sort of quantify like, you know. And I think that most people don't think outside of the human framework,\nyou know what I mean, like, just driving around. For me, living outside of the jungle, even just for a few weeks I get, you don't even think about the fact that there's other species around us, we really don't day to day. You look at TV and you listen\nto the radio and it doesn't, it's not very consequential\nto the average person living in a city that\nthere are these, you know, islands covered in walruses\nand that there's rainforests filled with birds and frogs and all these things happening. The salmon are contributing\nto our fresh water and that life is literally\ngiven to us and made possible by these ecological systems. To me, that's where like the whole essence of my existence comes from. - Yeah, thank you for that reminder, because you're basically saying\nlike the alien civilizations you dream about are here on earth. Those worlds are here. - [Paul] For me, yeah. - No, I agree with you. I think I agree with you, and I think that's actually the way I think most of the time. I think I'm on mushrooms all the time, genetically somehow because\nwhen I go out in nature, it's just the beauty, even of nothing, you talk about the Amazon, man, just basics of nature fill me with awe. The other thing that fills me with awe is our own mind, like the\nbiology of these things firing. Basically, not our own mind, but biology of any living organisms 'cause it's like an ecosystem. These cells came together,\nthey somehow function, they delegate, they mostly\noperate in a local way. First of all, it's just like\nyou said with the anacondas, you start out as a tiny\nsnake and you become giant. When you're a tiny snake,\nyou're prey for everything, when you're a giant\nsnake, you're a predator, or you're prey to no one. And just that whole process, same starting with a single\nembryo, single cell as a human. And through the embryogenic process, constructing this giant human\nthat's able to have limbs, move about the world, think about things, write books and so on. So you see that that is\nincredibly beautiful, and all of that is here on earth, yes. And so actually I was being\nsort of poetic about aliens and so on. I think I can spend 99.99% in terms of filling my\nmind with awe and beauty just looking down here on earth. For sure, I agree with you. - Yeah, and they shouldn't cancel out. Like, I think it's beautiful that there's people that are\nfascinated and obsessed with looking out into space\nand that will travel there. I mean, just to me, the idea of, I mean I have a little\npiece of meteorite at home that I hold. It does amazing things to\nmy mind 'cause I'm like, everything I've ever\ntouched is from this earth, and I'm holding this\nthing that's been places that we can't even think about. And it blows my mind and I love it. But when it comes to like intelligence, I think it's like, I'm so\nconcerned with the fact that we're at this moment in history, and it's interesting to me that, you know, we had the internet and now\nthat with the emergence of AI and more and more I feel like\nwe are starting to resemble like an ant colony, where\nthere's more and more connection, and there's more and more interaction globally between everybody. In the next 10 years,\nwe're gonna have to decide, are we gonna let our ocean\necosystems just collapse? Are we gonna just take\nthat 3% of rainforest and just let them log the shit\nout of it until it's gone? And it's like, we're gonna be in a very different reality then, then it's gonna be very dystopian future. Or, can we keep the good things\nabout earth, transcend that, realize that we have these\nincredible alien species around us that are animals\nthat we grew up with, that we wouldn't be here without,\nthat we owe something to. And I feel like at that stage then the outward look becomes something else. It's almost like we've proven, if aliens came up to us,\nthat's when I'd feel good. Aliens would come up to us and they said, you know, Louie has the\nthing where he goes, God comes back and he\ngoes, what did you do? He goes, the polar bears are brown. He's like, I left food for you. And it's like, if the aliens\ncame and were like, you know, and they interviewed the elephants and they said, \"How are you feeling?\" And the elephants would be like, \"Listen, fuck these little primates. You know what they've done to us?\" And it's like, I mean, you know, I've seen people break an elephant, I've seen it all with that stuff. And it's like, if anybody was to ask them, they'd be screaming. And so like to me, it's just, you know, I have trouble looking out into space, I have trouble looking out\ninto normal life as a human because I'm so concerned\nwith trying to make sure that they're okay because not\nenough people are doing that. - Well, the interesting thing\nabout all the development with AI and just that we're living more and more of our life online, I think we're actually learning what's missing when it's online. Like, I think people realize that online interaction is shallow, but we're just learning\nthat that's a reality, that we need that human connection. And I think there's going to\nbe the swing back to like, sadly, AI systems of the future might be able to live\nfulfilling lives online, but us humans have to have\na deep connection with earth and like with each other\nand physical connection. I think there's going to be a\nphase somewhere in the century where we go back to deep\nphysical connection, and there'll be a digital\nworld that we visit that will be separate. You have discussion\nwith that, with Twitter, with Instagram, with all\nthese social networks that they seem to be dividing us, they seem to not be bringing happiness. And you have to try to\nfigure out like, okay, so how do we use them in a way that does connect us, does educate\nus, grow our knowledge base, but also keeps our lives fulfilling in a deep human way that we're for good and for bad genetically designed that we can't overcome,\nthat we can't escape these meat vehicles. - Yeah, but to me that's so reassuring. We all have those friends\nthat are like, you know, we gotta live forever. And it's like, I don't know man, do you? I don't know. Is it that bad\nthat this is how it works, like, that we don't understand it? - Yeah, and it's often\nfrom the tech sector that you have discussions\nabout immortality and so on. I think that's somehow trying to escape the beauty of this earth that there's something beautiful. - [Paul] Too bright to look at. - Yeah. And I perhaps\nlike you am worried about the unintended negative\nconsequences of trying to escape the way things are on this earth because this is an incredible mechanism. - How many times in the past\nhas new technology come out that people have hailed as\nblasphemy, or it's not gonna work or it goes against nature. And now, well, heart\ntransplants are pretty cool. You could say what you\nwant about like television and like, you know, it rots your brain. It's like, yeah, but also how many times have you sat in a room full\nof people being entertained and all laughing and\ninteracting and eating popcorn because of the televisions there? And it's not one or the other. And so I feel like with AI, we'll learn our way through it, you know. - Like with the legged robots especially, and humanoid also. So anything on legs,\nfour legs or two legs. I remember like the\nfirst time I interacted with a legged robot, I saw a magic there, that this too can have consciousness, this too can have this life-like quality that a human being loves\nabout other human beings, about other living creatures. Now, while I'm still, I grew up in the place with no internet in a time with no internet, so I still like biological dogs better. I noticed the magic in robotic dogs, and it makes me wonder, same way we're just talking\nabout aliens looking up, it makes you wonder about\nother aliens civilizations. Now the deep love is for\ndogs, for other humans, but there's still this wander. - Ah, I struggle with that. Like you said, whatever's\ngoing on in here, the idea, and there's so\nmuch talk about the fact, like at what point does an\nartificially-intelligent robot become something that has, and it's like I get very\nuncomfortable with that. It makes me... I don't know how to handle the things 'cause I don't know\nenough about it probably. But it's like, I don't know how to handle. - I don't know how to handle either, nobody knows anything about\nit because it's really, everything is terrifying here. It could be as simple as\nconsciousness is easy to fake. So what if we live in a world\n10 to 20 years from now where your toaster, there's a\nbunch of robots in your room that are faking consciousness. And then you fall in love with them and you have a deep connection with them, and then you actually\nhave a deeper connection with your toaster than you do with any romantic human partner you've ever had. And you start to-- - I was upset about the dogs. I was like, at least the robot doesn't take a shit on the floor. You just took it way worse. - Yeah, yeah. And then they start to, I don't know if you've seen AI porn, but it gets pretty intense. - Like, fully AI porn?\nLike, they're fake people? - [Lex] Fake people take people that can-- - Things I've missed in the jungle. - Things. (chuckles) Boy do I have a lot to show you, or not show you, not show you."

      "section": "Climate change",
      "text": "Let me ask you about a touchy topic, climate change. What's the effect of climate\nchange on the Amazon, maybe species diversity. What is something that\npeople should think about? Because there's different views on, I think most people\nbelieve that climate change is human-caused and that it's happening, but there is different\nperspectives on the degree of damage that it's\ngoing to do over the next several decades and what\nour response should be as a society. And so it would be amazing to\nhear your perspective on it, in small slices of your\nexperience or in large. - To me, there's no denying the fact that we are experiencing changes. I think anybody that\ndoesn't agree with that hasn't been outside in the last 20 years, or hasn't interviewed old farmers who will tell you that\nit changed or, you know. I think a lot of us can agree with that. Where I deviate is that I\nam not a climate scientist, I am not qualified, and so I just like\neverybody else am listening. And what happens to me is I see that someone like Santiago Durand, JJ's father, will tell me, \"It's totally\ndifferent than it was when I was a kid, the seasons have changed and moved.\" In New York when I was a kid, we used to get like white Christmas, like we used to get snow. I was in shorts. I came off the plane right before coming here and\nI was in shorts for a second. I was like, this is a different reality. But my ability or my\ninterpretation of climate change, you know, I feel like is just as dumb as those people that go like, it's really cold, I thought\nthey said it was getting warmer. It's like, it's a very rudimentary thing. And so as a someone that's fighting for the preservation of biodiversity, I don't feel like I'm any more qualified than the average person. I can only provide anecdotal evidence of the stuff I've seen. What I do do though, and I always make a\nstrong delineation here, is that I can speak to the\nfact that I've been places where the ocean fisheries\nhave been depleted and the local fishermen can tell you, and the scientists can tell\nyou there's no more fish here. I've been to the places\nwhere the rainforest line is being pushed back in Borneo and it's getting smaller\nand smaller and smaller. And I've been in the Amazon and I've walked through the killing fields and through the fires and\nI've burnt my lungs on it. And I'm a big believer, personally, in instead of trying to take on all of it, I've tried very hard in\nmy life to pick one thing. And to me that one thing is protecting as many wild heartbeats as I can because they're under constant fire. And so climate change, you know, there's so much arguing over it, and like you said, the\ndegree to which we affect it. And how do you, you know what I mean? Like, I like to have provable data points. I can show you tropical deforestation, I can show you the decline in tigers over the last a hundred years, I can't prove, you know what I mean? Like, I can't answer that\nquestion, I don't think, probably you can better than I can. - No, I think one of the criticism I'd love to get your opinion on is one of the criticisms that somebody like Jordan Peterson provides is that the climate is\nsuch a complex system, there's so many variables that making conclusive statements about what's going to happen with\nthe quote, unquote \"climate\" in the next 10, 20, 50 years is a nearly impossible task. Therefore, as he would say, as people like Björn Loberg would say, the kind of fear mongering that is done saying we should spend\nhumongous amounts of money to change the trajectory\nof everything we're doing in terms of energy, in terms of infrastructure and so on, in terms of how we allocate\nmoney is not justified because predicting is very difficult. And instead, it's better\nexactly what you're saying, which is focusing on local problem, (chuckles) local, saying we need to protect the Amazon. What are the things attacking\nthe Amazon this year in the next five years? How can we stop the deforestation? How can we stop different things? And humans are exceptionally good at coming up with solutions for that, especially when you put money behind it, you put attention to it. And that's the way we solve\nall the different problems that are projected for the climate change in its worst case scenarios\nto be realized on this earth. So that's kind of the case he would make. And I should also mention\nthat one of the reasons"

      "text": "I was fortunate enough\nto discover your work is, first, a friend mentioned that I should definitely talk to you, and then I Googled you. And I saw that somebody recommended that Jordan Peterson\nabsolutely must talk to you on his podcast.\n- Oh, wow. - [Lex] I think it was like a Reddit post. - Thank you, Reddit poster, that's great. - And I was like, oh, interesting. And then I looked, and Jordan hasn't yet. I thought my goal is\nfor you to talk to Rogan and to Jordan Peterson\nfor different reasons, but for the same reason, they get connected to a human being that deeply cares about this earth. And I think that's probably\nthe right lens through which to look at the effects of climate change in terms of focusing\non the different things that are threatening\nthe diversity of species in this most magical place on\nearth, which is the Amazon. But also, as you talk about\nwith elephants and tigers in India, and focusing on\nhow to solve those problems. I don't know if there's\nany comment you wanna make on folks like Jordan Peterson who are sort of raising questions about how much do we really\nunderstand about the climate. - First of all, I'm such\na Jordan Peterson fan, and I think the guy is heroic\nfor a number of reasons. And I find his use of language\nand his use of theology and the message that\nhe puts out wonderful. I cringe a little bit when he says, I feel like, and I might not\neven be accurate on this, but I cringe a little bit\nwhen I feel like he dismisses that there is an ecological\nemergency happening right now. Now, I'm not saying, I'm not talking about\nclimate change specifically, but I've heard him say, you know, \"Environmentalists upset me.\" And he goes, \"Well, what do\nyou mean by the environment, everything?\" And it sort\nof seems to outrage him. And I kind of agree\nwith him there because, so are you telling me that we need to halt our global process and progress and economies and everything? I don't know, I don't know. So to me, that doesn't bother me because he's exploring what the hell are these\npeople talking about. I personally have friends and students and people filling my inboxes, I have young kids telling\nme that they've become vegan and they ride a bicycle and\nsometimes they don't watch TV 'cause it uses electricity, and I mean, they're just\nbecoming so terrified of they're killing the earth. And so it's this doomsday\nanti-human sentimentalist thing that we're evil. It's almost like a new\nreligion about your evil. And so to me, it almost makes me in a totally different camp where like climate change\nand the right/left politics, and you know, I can sit at a family, I can see the Thanksgiving dinner and listen to the climate\nthing go back and forth. And I'm like, I'm not even here. And that might actually annoy some people in the environmental field that might feel betrayed\nby me saying that. But I don't care. My job, and it's not just the Amazon, and that's one note that\nI wanted to make is that my career has taken place\nlargely in the Amazon and also in India and now a lot in Africa. It's not even just these\nexotic places either it's people realizing that, you know, the salmon runs in Canada and the butterfly\ngardens in our backyards. There's biodiversity everywhere. And I strongly feel like, you know, the idea of Junglekeepers, the idea of stewards of nature. And so for me, my job, my one thing, and I try to tell this to\nthese kids that message me and my inboxes are full\nof this where they go, you know, the climate is burning and elephants are in decline\nand tigers, and this and that. I'm like, guys look, first of all, calm down, first of all. Like, go outside, go get laid, do something, have fun. Next, pick something that you can affect and it doesn't have to\nbe with the environment. Do something good on earth. Go help somebody that needs food. Go help your elderly\nneighbor, whatever it is. Practice with being effective\nat one thing at a time. And so for me, like I\nsaid from those early days of sitting there with JJ on\nthe side of a river and going, someone has to protect this. My concern is that we've\nlost 70% of the wildlife on this planet in the last 50\nyears, that's a huge problem. Wildlife maintain the ecosystems. And so I have a very\nclear cut, very definable, very measurable and provable thing that I'm fighting against, and to me, it's a very small ask, don't cut down the 3% of the world that has 50% of the biodiversity in it. Maybe let's keep some wild\ntigers for future generations because tigers have their own\ninherent right to exist here. That's my thing. In terms of when we get to, you know, I get attacked for, you\nknow, you should be a vegan. Okay. You have me roll into a village in the Amazon when they\noffer me spider monkey and you tell me that I should be a vegan, you see how much they respect you when you tell them that you're a vegan. But no. So for someone like Peterson, I think it's actually good that he's first of all telling everyone\nto make their damn beds, and exploring it through a different lens. He's coming at it from a totally\ndifferent thing and saying, are we just being alarmist here? I mean, again, imagine\nif there isn't a problem and they're making one out of it and all the implications that\nthat could have for progress. So I think what he's doing\nis perfectly reasonable. There is a podcast though where he's, it was a great one though, where he's discussing animal intelligence. And I could really see that the human psyche and theology and religion is so much his world that really the idea of animals\nbeing intelligent was novel, and it was fascinating. - Yeah, that's why I would love\nfor the two of you to talk. I don't know, and hopefully\nI'm not outta line here, but he is so focused on the human mind that I think he forgets that there's other life out there. There's this whole\nmachine of intelligence, of a kind of intelligence out there. This entire trillions of\nspecies, tiny and big, just everywhere, and we're actually part of it. So to look at it, human\npsychology is distinct from that is missing at least some of the picture. - Some of the picture. I do believe though I would\nagree with him on that humans are unique. Human psychology is unique, we just are. He's in such an interesting\nplace because usually you have, you know, environmentalists\nwho are like, you know, nature, nature, nature, and that's very anti-human, and then you have the other side. And it's like he's on this path where he's starting to explore what those diverse intelligences mean. And that to me is really amazing 'cause I love hearing\nwhat he'll do with that. - And I think also on top of that, I think if you're aware of\nnature, deeply aware of nature, it gives you another perspective on the evolutionary history of humans. Like, it is one thing to be\nan evolutionary biologist and kind of study it from\na philosophical perspective and it's the other to\nreally I think experience it and deeply know and to see, I don't know, the fact that we came from fish and really be cognizant of that. That's something else. That's like, I don't know, to realize that we're part\nof a computing machine that created intelligence. We're part of the thing\nthat started bacteria and is now creating AI and I don't know, Dunking Donuts, I don't know what else is impressive. - [Paul] The other\ngreat human achievement. - It is the other great human. I was thinking, what's\ninteresting about Boston? - But I feel like we keep\nscratching up against this thing in this conversation that it's so easy, I think something like 50 or more percent of the humans on this\nplanet live in cities. And I think it's so easy for people to forget\nthat we share this planet with so many other things. And I think that that sort of, in a way, we're almost\nlike ecological orphans and that we've left the things that actually make us feel at home. And that's a bit of a stretch 'cause I don't know if\neverybody feels that way, but for me, I mean professionally\nas an expedition guide, when I take people into nature, I see what happens to them. And they leave going, I mean it doesn't have to be the Amazon, it could be, you know, upstate New York. But it's like, if you do it the right way, if you remove the fear of breaking an ankle, seeing a snake, being bitten by a\nmosquito, all that stuff, if you can get people to a peaceful moment and you're fly fishing, a lot of times they'll take that moment and they'll talk about\nit the rest of their life if they don't live in that, then there's those of us who\nspend our lives doing that, but for a reason because it's\nthe only place we feel sane. - And you were kind enough to suggest that we might travel together\nfor a time at some point. If we do that, if we journey together, where would you recommend we should go? - So what I would wanna show you is sort of, I'd want\nto take you to church, I'd want to take you\nto see the giant trees, take you to meet the old gods, really. There's places when you\nwalk in off the river that are so deep in the forest, you know, and again, now we do this, we have the boats, we have the rangers, we protect this ecological corridor now. And so it would be taking you\nto meet some of those loggers that we converted. It'd be taking you, we'd have\nto go to the floating forest, meet some of the trees\nthat I love the most, go piranha fishing. And like, really just spend, my ideal trip for you would be to spend five days of airplane-mode phone, completely living out comfortable. I'm not saying, I don't wanna torture you, I'm saying go and live\ncomfortably on an expedition in the Amazon. And that means a few days\nat this research station, maybe go upriver three days and camp up here just on the edge of where the uncontacted are, and then come back and then\nsee the Junglekeepers station. But along the way, seeing all\nthe special sacred places, it would be almost like\nsaying, like, let's go see all the treasures of Italy. It's like, this is one of the most beautiful things on earth, and I've had the incredible,\nalmost unbelievable fortune to be responsible for protecting it. I think it's a privilege to be able to share that with people. - To be able to witness\nwhat this earth has created. It's been just a gift just\neven to follow your Instagram, the window you create on\nthis part of the world is just really beautiful. I do wanna ask on that, maybe it's like behind\nthe scenes a little bit, like, how do you keep the equipment dry? How do you, like how hard is bringing\nequipment, the cameras? You're an incredible\nfilmmaker and photographer, so how do you make it work? - I don't know, it's not that hard. - [Lex] Really? It's wet.\n- It's not that bad. It is wet. The new iPhones are waterproof. And if they don't get, I'm telling you dude,\nit's been such a weapon, it's been awesome. If you drop it in the river, my one thing is you gotta have a tether 'cause I drop it all the time. And so I'll be hanging off a boat and I'll be trying to take a video, and I'll be like, here\nwe are in the Amazon, you can see the line and\n(imitates water plopping). That's the biggest thing. We shoot on Canons. I don't know, it's worked\nout, it's not that bad. - Oh really? So you can\nkeep the equipment dry. - I keep the equipment\ndry and I actually don't, a lot of people put\ntheir in silica at night and keep it dry and then they take it out. And I find that when you do that, the temperature change creates\nmoisture inside the camera. So what I do is I never do that, I just keep my cameras in\nmy backpack with a zipper so they're more or less\nexposed to the elements. And so it sort of always has\na little bit of equilibrium, and that's it. I mean, I shoot on some pretty\nfancy equipment sometimes and it's great. But I mean the awesome thing\nthough now is that like, with a cell phone, I mean like, I put my phone down on\nthe ground a few weeks ago and let this rhino walk\nup to it and stuff. And it's like, you can get video footage that you can literally put on Netflix. It's getting really exciting, and that's where I deviate\nfrom the nature people that are like we need to\ngo back and live in cabins. I'm like, dude, this is awesome. And I love taking slowmos, like, no way. - It makes you re-appreciate,\nbut just by yourself, just re-appreciate over and over and over and then you can also\nshare it with the world. - Well, that's the thing\nof sharing it with people, there's nothing better than like teaching a kid to catch a fish. In a way Instagram has\nallowed us to do that where it's like, I can\nhave this crazy ass moment that is so unique and then\nput it up for people to see. I mean, I remember one\nof the most recent things that got people, you never know what's\ngonna get people excited. I literally just like, there was like 3000 butterflies on the beach and they were all like\nblack, red, and blue, beautiful butterflies. And I just like panned the phone across it and then like jumped in\nthe river and swam away. And threw that up on Instagram\nand people went berserk. They're like, this is\nthe most amazing thing and like four different\naccounts reached out to try and share it. And I was like, butterflies,\nthey're everywhere. There's is 4,000 species\nof butterfly in the Amazon. But sharing that with people is beautiful. - How do you find the thing to shoot? How do you come up with the butterflies? How do you notice the\nthing that's beautiful and say, I'm going to\nwait a minute, like pause, this is beautiful, let me\ntake a picture of this, because like sometimes\nyou might get used to the beauty, right? - Yeah. Or like sometimes\nsimple crazy things like leafcutter ants,\nthey're just walking by, it becomes pedestrian. It's like, well. I mean, just like when you're\nliving at the elephant camp and it's like the elephant comes out and he starts like\ntrashing the water bucket. We're like, \"Would you stop? We're trying to watch\n'Peaky Blinders' here. Just leave us alone.\" It becomes normal after a while. But no, in the jungle, that's never a struggle for\nme, because as a photographer, it's like whenever my eye\nhits on something I went, I've never seen that\nmany of those butterflies all the same species together. Oh yeah, I'm trying to get this one thing that the butterflies do\nis in the dry season, the salt deposits, you'll\nget like three or four, maybe 5,000 butterflies all\ncoming onto this one area of sand 'cause there'll\nbe like some leaching, there'll be some salt\ndeposit there or something. And they'll all be wings\nflat against the ground with their proboscises on the sand. And if you go walk near them, they will vortex up and\nyou have a rainbow vortex of butterflies, and you can\nlike go run through that. And it's surreal. What I wanna do is get the shot where I, I guess leave the phone\nrecording in slowmo facing up, and leave it there for an hour. Let the butterflies come in and settle and then disturb them so I get the bottom of\nthe vortex of the bug. I'm like, these are the\nways I think where I'm like, how can I show people the\nabsolute mind-blowing, you know, perfection.\n- [Lex] With an iPhone? That's amazing.\n- I mean, that's what I have, I'm sure that somebody\nelse could do it with a red and nail it, but it's like, that's what I have in the jungle because I have to travel light. - Yeah, I think that works. It was the same thing when\nI was traveling in Ukraine. The equipment was just that suitcase over there with the foam. And you just shove it full of equipment and who cares?\n- [Paul] Do the best you can. - You can go to war\nzone, it doesn't matter. It has to do with the, you were talking about like\nprotecting your camera or not, it feels like the more you protect stuff, the more it's gonna get damaged. - Yeah. Like, see my\ncameras, they're all missing, this is amazing to me. So all my cameras are missing the, how you can see the\nmetal through the paint, so all this because I'm constantly, I'll like slide in and take a picture. They're banged up but\nthey're good machines. - I think they get tough over\ntime if you put 'em through, it's like the immune. - It's like muscles. It's like David Goggin's cameras, you gotta make 'em suffer every day. - Yeah. What's your view on hunting?"

      "section": "Hunting",
      "text": "So you really hate poachers. - I really hate poachers. - How do they operate? Who are they? What are they up to? What do they do? - Poachers to me are the\npeople that are going in and annihilating wildlife\nfor profit without any, you know, the people that are going in and machine-gunning an\nelephant to take its tusks. The people that are sneaking\ninto protected areas in Africa and shooting rhinos so that they can cut off their horns before the animal's even dead\nwhile it's baby is beside it. And there's a difference\nbetween a poacher and a hunter. I'm a hunter, JJ's a hunter. I work with an organization\ncalled VETPAW in Africa, and they use United States\nveterans who have come back, post 9/11 veterans who\nhave come back from the war and have these skills. And they've been using\nthese guys to protect the last black rhinos,\nwhite rhinos, elephants. And so, I've gotten to see this play out on a private reserve in Africa\nwhere these incredible people have decided to protect\nzebra's, wildebeest, all types of impala, giraffes, several herds of elephants,\nwhite rhinos, black rhinos, all of this stuff is protected. And what's interesting is\nit's a hunting preserve. And so it's been very\ninteresting and challenging sharing my work there with the\npublic because, for instance, I went to a very high-profile\nphotographer recently and I said, \"You have to\nget over here and see this.\" It's amazing what these people have done, it's this reserve called Buffalo Kloof. This rescued families of\nelephants and they have, you can see a black rhino\nevery day if you want to. They're critically endangered. And it's because of the\nwork that VETPAW does, protecting these animals from poachers. But what people don't\nunderstand is that hunting happens all the time on the reserve, not for the elephants and the rhinos, those are special and they\nwill never be hunted there. But things like an impala,\nthings like an inhala, a wildebeest, a zebra. There aren't as many\npredators as there used to be. So if you leave those animals unhunted, you know, without the\nwolf to chase the herd to thin off the ones that\nare old and dying or sick, well then you just have animals that are old and dying and\nsick walking around suffering. And so on reserves like this, they hunt, and they take the old ones, and they use the funding from hunting. No one's gonna pay you $30,000 to take a picture of a buffalo, but they'll pay you\n$30,000 to hunt a buffalo. And so these reserves\nresponsibly and ethically on foot can go hunting and manage. And again, if they were hunting rhinos or if they were hunting\nelephants, I'd be out in a second. - They're hunting non-endangered species. - They're hunting non-endangered species, they're hunting game species. And the difference is\nthat a poacher is gonna, and so those are responsible\nhunters that are ecologists and conservationists, whereas a poacher is\nsomeone that will come in and kill recklessly and murder an animal for no reason for a part to sell. - I would love to travel\ntogether actually. So we'll talk offline, I would love to make that\nhappen, if you allow me. - I'm a hundred percent serious, man. I've tremendous respect for your work and I've been watching\nyou since the beginning. I would love to do that together. - I've talked to Joe quite a bit about it, and I really love the\nidea of eating the meat that I've hunted. It's mostly what I eat is meat, not for dietary, I don't\nhave any weird constraints on my diet and so on, I just really enjoy eating meat. - [Paul] It's really good. - And there is a part\nof me that's bothered by factory farming, that it's very easily-accessible meat but there's something\ndeeply wrong with it. Part of the reason I love fishing and eating the fish that I catch, it just seems to be more ethical, but also a more intimate, deep connection, honest connection with nature. You get to see the killing of\nthe food that you're consuming versus removing that from the picture, not even thinking about it, not thinking about that\nthis came from the meat. I love the idea that I kill one animal and I eat that animal\nbasically for the whole year. - Yeah. An ethically-slaughtered animal, whether it's a fish or\na deer or whatever else, to me that's, oh God, I'm gonna use the\nwrong religious term here, but there's a, I feel like I wanna use\nthe word like sacrament, but it's like, there's a deeply profound ritual. And honestly, if you teach\na kid to grow a vegetable, you show a kid how to grow a carrot and the miracle of like, wait I put a, this thing just grew in there, it just appeared because\nthere was sunlight? And it's like, yeah. To me, yes, when you feel\nthat fish tug on the line, to me it does something that awakens a deep primal\nsomething, this satisfaction. And then when you eat that you feel good. The other thing sort of\nfunctionally speaking is that, aside from the fact that I\nthink it's one of the original, we are so disconnected,\nlike we should be hunting. We should be gathering, walking more. I mean, look at what we discussed now, like people are like, oh,\nyou gotta get your steps in for the day. And it's like, that never\nused to be a problem. You know, people are like,\nshould we be eating animals? And it's like, what do you\nthink we do here on earth? Like, I'm not sure how\nyou got so confused, but Walmart did it to you. Like, I don't know. Living where I've lived, I mean, from 18 to 35, I\nfeel like I've grown up, I've lived more outside\nthan I have inside. It just to me like showing\npeople these things, I can see this miraculous\nwonder in their eyes when they realize that they\ncan reach out into the world and interact with something. So when I hear these frantic\npeople talking about, you know, whether or not it's right, no, of course it is. Then again, factory farming is awful, but I try and walk the line. I'm worried about wild animals, I'm worried about wild ecosystems. The other thing that's sort of important about hunting is that if people's livelihoods\ndepend on salmon and elk and ocean fisheries, well then they'll fight\nto protect it naturally because it's part of their life. If everybody's going to Burger King and everybody's getting\nchicken wrapped in plastic, they forget that the fish are there because they're too busy watching sitcoms. And so when the conglomerate\ncomes in and builds a dam, nobody really cares. And then you just end up\nwith a few hippies and signs standing next to the river\nand it becomes silly. We forget the meaning."

      "text": "- You mentioned that ayahuasca reveals... - [Paul] Oh boy. Oh no. - the darkness that's there in the jungle. There's beauty, but there's darkness. So what is it that ayahuasca reveals? What is the heart of darkness? - Fuck, it opens the heart\nof darkness right up. I'm gonna show you a picture of our shaman and then I'm gonna ask you if\nyou wanna do ayahuasca here, not here in that sense, it can only be done in the jungle. Anybody that tells you,\nI've heard people be like, \"Oh, I did ayahuasca\nin Brooklyn last week\" and I'm like, no you didn't. I actually told that to my native friends. I went, \"Hey, guess what?\" I said, \"A bunch of gringos keep thinking they're doing\nayahuasca in Brooklyn.\" And they were like, howling, laughing. They're like, \"You can't\ndo it outside the jungle.\" And I was like, \"Exactly.\" - I've never done\nayahuasca, I would love to. I've done or eaten whatever mushrooms, it's a wonderful experience. - I think it's wonderful. But ayahuasca, oh man, see I had done mushrooms,\nI thought I was okay. You know, I was like I got this. I had my notebook, I was like, I'm gonna\njournal a little bit. I quickly, quickly realized\nhow out of my depth I was and how unprepared I was\nfor what was happening 'cause you sit in a circle\nwith these native guys. And there's one, he's got\nthe feathers and he is old, and he is got a face like\nthe map of the world, and he's smoking this\nfat, old tobacco thing. He calls you forward and\nyou kneel before him, and you're going, is\nit too late to back up? And everyone's, you\nknow, he has one candle and he blows smoke over the\ncup and he hands it to you. And you're like, again, it's these things that you can't argue\nwith, it's these facts. You're like, as soon as this\ngoes down, I'm gone. I know it. And this is a moment in my\nlife that I have to either embarrass myself in front of everybody or I'm going forward with this. And then I went and sat. And you're sitting in the dark. Again, so we're on a platform\nwith palm-thatched roof, the jungle is all around you, so all those tens of millions\nof frogs and insects. And I'm like, all right, cool. And I remember, I tried to\nlight a cigarette or something, and I went, oh, that's not gonna happen. And then I put my hands on the floor. My experience, I mean, like, you've done mushrooms so you know, it's interesting, it's introspective. No, this was like somebody\nunzipped the universe. Without boring people with it,\nI spent a lot of time in like unconstructed dream space,\nlike, floating between nebulas. Like, there's a long period where there was no physical shape\nwhere I lived without a name. It's like you get brought so deep down, so elementally lost in the universe where I truly felt like I was experiencing moving through places like that asteroid that I have. It's like a piece of, you're a piece of something\ndetached from the earth. And so I got back from it, had a interesting new\nappreciation for life. I strongly suggest that\npeople just do mushrooms like a normal person, unless you're ready. - [Lex] So it was really intense. - It was really intense. But to be fair, the shaman who did it was like the old school guy. And he was getting up there in years and he had forgotten\nand overboiled the brew. And so we came back and it\nwas like four in the morning, and I had, you know, all this crazy shit, I had been on journeys\nand years down there. And so when I came back and I had hands, I started crying, I\nstarted absolutely weeping. - [Lex] Gratitude or what? - Gratitude that I was alive, I was gonna get to see my people again. I was like, I'm gonna get\nto see my parents again. I'm gonna get to talk-- - So you kinda thought\nyou might have been gone. - I was gone, I was gone. I was a dimly-conscious\nsomething floating in dark space and spent what felt like years down there. I really did feel like being reborn, which I was like, cheap trick. But no, the way it moves\nyou through the jungle, the way the jungle\nmoves through your skin, there are moments of absolute majesty and incredible discovery\nthat happen along the way. And on the way up, the\njungle brings you up and the shaman brings you up and you get to move through\nthe forest in a way that it's almost like you're inhabiting the consciousness of animals. Very, very, very, like, I didn't think that\nhallucinogenics could do this to a brain, you know. Mushrooms, you're like, \"Oh,\nI feel like I can feel music.\" Like, cool, you know. You guys wanna watch\n\"March of the Penguins?\" - This is transformative. Did that change you? - I don't know. I think it definitely, I almost feel like it showed me the thing that I was scared the most of that it's all just cold, dark, nothing, and like brought me to the\nbasement of the universe. And I felt like the point\nof that was to come back to this place where there's all\nthis life and light and love and all this amazing\nstuff that we experience on a day-to-day basis and\ndon't take for granted. And so just like almost dying, this was like fully dying, you know. But the great part is is that, usually it's not that intense. This guy had overboiled the brew. He'd also, I saw the vine afterwards, most ayahuasca vines are\nlike as thick as your arm, this one was like as\nthick as a garbage can. It was like the oldest\nayahuasca vine you can imagine. And at like four in the morning, I like crawled over to my friend Chris, who's a tough New York City firefighter. We were holding each\nother, just like weeping, just like, \"Thank God we're back.\" Then we had to go looking for the shaman. Where the hell is this guy? He's gone. We found him in the morning and he was laying in the stream naked, like ET at the end when he\nis like laying, like in the. Yeah, he kicked his own ass with that brew and he retired after that. - [Lex] Oh shit. - So we really got, like, we had somebody turn the\ndial all the way up on us and so we got blasted. It's not supposed to be that bad. - But I think you're\nsomebody who's fearless and sort of diving into\nthose kinds of places. - I think I also retire from ayahuasca. I could be fearless with other things, but I think I'm good. - It sounds kind of, to me personally, kind of exciting. - Well, I think that you\nhave a severely fearless aspect to you. When you come up with\nsomething that intrigues you, like if somebody told you right now that you could go\nphysically into deep space, I feel like you would do it. - Yeah, I'd go to Mars, yeah. And some of it is... I don't even know if you have that. Some of that is more Goggins like, I want to see where my mind breaks by pushing it to tough places. There's a curiosity of exploring the mind, the limits of the mind. I feel like your--\n- That's not a cold plunge, that's like, you're not coming back. - [Lex] Right, and that's okay. - See. I do. I'm with you on that I\nlove seeing my limits, I absolutely love seeing my limits. I love getting my ass kicked, I love being shown how insignificant I am. But when it comes to something like that where you gotta push your chips in, it's gotta be something for me, it's gotta be a hill that I\nbelieve in before I die on it. Like to me, the promise of\nexploring space isn't enough. But like, even just the way you said, you're like, \"I'm going\nto Ukraine. Here I go.\" You know, there's a certain dedication to curiosity at any expense. And I think that that is\nsomething that maybe we share in different directions. - Something tells me with\nthose crocodiles outside I would've gotten eaten. Something tells me. There's something trying to\npreserve you in this world, I'm not sure exactly what that is. Somehow you keep surviving."

      "text": "What do you think is the\nmeaning of this whole thing? Why are we here? Like, do you ever ask\nyourself for that question? - I feel like that's every day. I feel like I'm someone\nthat lives with that a lot. And I think that it actually takes me away from the human world a little bit. I feel like I've always\nbeen a little bit apart because I think that other people do, you know, mushrooms and they go, wow, it really made me think\nabout how amazing it is here. And I feel like on a daily basis, I find myself where I'm like, I can't believe that\nany of this is possible. And that goes from how\ndelicious something tastes to being able to talk to\nsomeone in your family, or have a phone. There's times where I'm in\nthe Amazon and I miss home, and even just FaceTiming with someone, I go, this is possible? Like, people were rubbing sticks together to try and survive sabertooth\ntigers not that long ago and I'm over there like,\n\"Yo, mom, look at this.\" It's wild. Like, I'm in\na constant state of awe. I actually hope that this is a testing ground. And whether it's aliens\nor God or whatever it is, that this is something\ncrucially important. That would be nice, because\nit feels like it is. - Yeah, I hope that too, that the universe almost created\nus to see what's possible. And that I'd like to believe that beauty and good is possible. - And those are the things\nthat make me say that it's not, it's impossible for it\nto just mean nothing. And just like you said,\nthere could be life forms that we can't even understand. I'm very open to the idea that there's meanings that\nwe have no idea about. The few things I know or\nthe things that I love and some of the things that I love are being pushed to extinction\nso I try to protect them. That's my mission. But I'm saying like in terms\nof what are we doing here, I'm just always amazed at the simplest things, you know, that we can sit here\ndoing this exchanging. - Using our imagination\nto fill in the gaps, exchanging feelings, experiences, images. Yeah, it fills you with awe. And every once in a while you get a little glimpse of something, like a deeper meaning that might be there. And you don't really know what it is, but you get a glimpse\nand you keep searching. And then it's over\nbefore you know it, Paul. Hopefully for you, you\ngot many more years. - [Paul] That's dark, man. - You're an important,\nimportant and a beautiful man. Paul, thank you so much for talking today. Thank you for being who you are, for everything you're doing. I hope to see you again soon, many times and maybe one day soon in the jungle. - I hope that happens. Thank you, Lex. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Paul Rosalie. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description.

  "full_text": "- It was just like one of those moments where we saw it at the same time. And we were standing by the tail, and the snake was so big that, I mean, this must have been a\n25-foot anaconda dead asleep, with a probably a 16-foot\nanaconda sprawled across her. And they're laying in the starlight and we're floating on top of a lake, standing there in the\nmiddle of the Amazon. And JJ just, I could feel the\nblood drain outta his face. And as like a however old I was, you know, maybe 20 years old. I just said if we could\nsomehow show people this, we'll be on the front cover\nin National Geographic and we can protect all\nthe jungle that we want. And so I tried to catch it. Yeah, so I jumped on the snake, and the only measurement\nI have of this animal is that when I wrapped my arms around it, I couldn't touch my fingers. And so I was, you know,\nmy feet were dragging. And to her credit, this anaconda did not turn around and eat me, 'cause her head was, you know, this big. And she went and she reached\nthe edge of the grass island and she starts plunging into the dark. And so I'm watching the stars vibrate as this anaconda is going, and I had to make the choice\nof either going head first down into the black, which, no thank you, or stopping and just keeping\nmy hand on this thing as it raced by me. And I just felt the scales\nand the muscle and the power go by and then eventually\ntaper down to the tail until it slipped away into the darkness. And I was laying there, just panting. - The following is a\nconversation with Paul Rosalie, a conservationist,\nexplorer, author, filmmaker, and real life Tarzan. Since, for much of the past 17 years, Paul has lived deep in\nthe Amazon rainforest protecting endangered species\nand trees from poachers, loggers and foreign nations funding them. He is the founder of Junglekeepers, which today protects over 50,000 acres of threatened habitat. And Paul is one of the most incredible human beings I've ever met. I hope to travel with him in\nthe Amazon jungle one day, because in his eyes, I saw a truth that can only be discovered\ndirectly by spending time among the immensity and power\nof nature at its purest. This is Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Paul Rosolie. In 2006, at 18 years old, you fled New York and\ntraveled to the Amazon. This started a journey that\nI think last to this day. Tell me about this first leap. What in your heart pulled you\ntowards the Amazon jungle? - From the time I was, you\nknow, three years old, I'd say, you know, it was dinosaurs,\nwildlife documentary, Steve Irwin, you name it. And when my parents said, you know, nature versus nurture,\nthey nurtured my nature. I was always just drawn\nto streams, forests, I wanted to go explore\nwhere the little creek led, I wanted to see the\nturtles and the snakes. And so I was a kid that hated school, did not get along with school. I was dyslexic and didn't\nknow it, undiagnosed, I didn't read until I\nwas like 10 years old, like, way behind. And so for me, the forest was safety. Like, I remember one time in first grade they had you doing those\nmultiplication sheets. That was pure hell for me. And so I actually got so\nupset that I couldn't do it, that I ran out the\nclassroom, ran out the door, and went to the nearest woods and I stayed there 'cause that was safe. And so for me, once I got to\nthe point where I was like, high school isn't working out, I had incredibly supportive\nparents that were like, \"Look, just get out. Take your GED, get outta\nhigh school after 10th grade. You gotta go to college, but start doing something you love.\" And so I saved up and bought\na ticket to the Amazon and met some indigenous guys. The second I walked in\nthat forest, it was like, it's like the first\nscene in \"Jurassic Park\" when they see the dinosaurs\nand they go, oh, this is it. I walked in there and just, I looked at those giant trees, I saw leafcutter ants in real\nlife, and I just went, \"Oh.\" It was like the movie\njust started, you know, that was when I came online. - Can you put into words what is it about that place that felt like home?\nWhat was it that drew you? What aspect of nature?\nThe streams, the water, the forest, the jungle, the animals, what drew you? - It's just, it's always been in my blood. I mean, for any forest, I mean, whether it's upstate\nNew York or India or Borneo. But the Amazon, it's all of\nthat turned up to this level where everything is superlatively diverse. You know, you have more plants and animals than anywhere else on earth. Not just now, but in the\nentire fossil record. The Andes Amazon interface, terrestrially, that's where it is. That's the greatest library\nof life that has ever existed. And so you're so stimulated, you're so overwhelmed with\ncolor and diversity and beauty and this overwhelming sense\nof natural majesty of these, you know, thousand-year-old trees, and half the life is up in\nthe canopy of those trees. We don't even have access to it, there's stuff without names\nwalking around on those branches and it's like, it just\ntakes you somewhere. And so going there, it was like, you know, the guys I met just opened\nthe door and they were like, how far do you wanna go\ndown the rabbit hole? How much of this do you want to see? - You mentioned Steve Irwin. You list a bunch of heroes that\nyou have, he's one of them. And you said that when you're\nunsure about a decision, you ask yourself, WWSD,\nwhat would Steve do? Why is that such a good\nheuristic for life, what would Steve do? - He's a human being that, like, everything we saw from\nSteve Irwin was positive. Everything was with a smile on his face. If he was getting bitten\nby a reticulated python, he was smiling. If he was getting destroyed in the news for feeding a crocodile\nwith his son too close, he was trying to explain\nto people why it's okay and why we have to love these animals. And everything was about love, everything was about, you\nknow, wildlife and protecting. And to me, a person like that, that where you only see positive things, that's a role model. - And it's just like an endless curiosity and hunger to explore\nthis world of nature. - Yeah, and an insatiable\nmadness for wildlife. I mean, the guy was just so much fun. - I gotta, if it's okay, read to you a few of your own words. You open (chuckles)\n- [Paul] Oh boy. - the book \"Mother of God\" with a passage that I think beautifully paints a scene. Before he died, Santiago\nDurand told me a secret. It was late at night\nin a palm-thatched hut on a bank of the Tambopata River, deep in the southwestern\ncorner of the Amazon Basin. Besides a mud oven, two\nwild boar heads sizzling, sizzled in a cradle of embers, their protruding tusks\ncurling in static agony as they cooked. The smell of burning cecropia wood and singed flesh filled the air. Woven basket containing monkey\nskulls hung from the rafters where stars peeked through\nthe gaps in the thatching. A pair of chickens huddled in\nthe corner, conversing softly. We sat facing each\nother on sturdy benches, across a table hewn from\na single cross section of some massive tree, now\nnearly consumed by termites. The song of a million insects\nand frogs filled the night. Santiago's cigarette\ntrembled in the aged fingers as he leaned close over the candlelight to describe a place hidden in the jungle. That line, the songs of a million insects and frogs filled the night,\nfor some reason hit me. What's it like sitting\nthere conversing among so many living creatures all around you? - Every night in the jungle, you live in constant awareness of that, out there in the darkness\nare literally millions of heartbeats around you. And so, like, we exist in this, you know, domesticated,\npaved world most of the time. But when you go out there past the roads and the telephone poles and the hospitals, and you make it out into earth, just wild earth and there's no, you know, it's not like this is a national park, there's no rescue helicopter\nwaiting to come get you, you are out there and you're\nsurrounded at night by, I mean, there are snakes and\njaguars and frogs and insects, and all this stuff just\ncrawling through the swamps and through the trees\nand through the branches. We put on headlamps and\ngo out into the night and just absolutely fall\nto our knees with wonder of the things that we see, it's absolutely incredible. - And most of it doesn't make\nsounds like the insects do. - The insects do, the frogs do, you have some of the\nnight birds making sounds, but a lot of it, everything has evolved\nto be silent, invisible. I mean, everything there is on the list. There's another line in \"Mother\nof God\" where I said like, you know, life is just like\na temporary moment of stasis and like the churning\nrecycling death march that is the Amazon like. It's been called the greatest\nnatural battlefield on earth. I mean, in any square acre, there's more stuff eating other\nthings than anywhere else. And you go through a swamp in\nthe Amazon and there's like, there's tarantulas floating on the water, there's frogs in the trees, there's tadpoles hanging from leaves waiting to drop into the water, there's fish waiting to eat them, there's birds in the trees. You literally are\nsurrounded by so many things that your brain can't process it. It's just overwhelming life. - Churning death march. Some of the creatures are waiting and some of them are being a\nbit more proactive about it. What do you make of that\nchurning death march, the amount of murder that's\nhappening all around you at all scales? What is that? You know, we dramatize wars and the millions of people\nthat were lost in World War II, some of them tortured, some of them dying with a gun in hand, some of them civilians, but\nit's just millions of people. What about the billions and billions and billions of organisms\nthat are just being murdered all around you? Does that change your view of nature, of life here? - I've always kind of wondered like that when you see like a\nwildebeest taken down by lions and eaten from behind while it's alive and it makes you question God. You know, you go, how\ncould they let this happen? In the Amazon, I find personally that these natural processes\nmake up almost a religion, that it reminds you how temporary we are, that, you know, the botflies that are trying to get into your skin and the mosquitoes that are\ntrying to suck your blood. When you sweat, you see the, you literally can like hold out your arm and watch the condensation\ncome off of your skin and rise up into the\ncanopy and join the clouds and rain back down in the afternoon, and then you drink the river\nand start it all over again. And it's like, it's flowing through you. So the Amazon reminds me that there's a lot that we don't understand. And so when it comes to that overwhelming and collective murder,\nas Werner Herzog put it, it's just part of the show, it's part of the freak show\nof the Amazonian night. - I see you in certain moments able to feel one with a mosquito that's trying to kill you slowly. - One with the mosquito is a stretch. - Is it always the enemy? What I mean is, like, you're part of the machine there, right? - Yeah, and it's like fair play. It's like fair play. So we have bullet ants and you know, you get nailed by a bullet\nant, and you just go. - Yeah, well done. Well done. - Yeah, today's over, I'm going back to bed and\nI'm taking a pile of Tylenol. - Do you think in that\nsense, when you're out there, are you a part of nature or\nare you separate from nature? Is man a part of nature or separate? - I think that's what's\nso refreshing about it, is that out there you truly are. And so whether we're bringing\nresearchers or film crews, or whether we're just out there\nourselves on an expedition, you truly are a part of nature. And so one of the things that\nmy team and I started doing when I became friends with these guys, this is a family of indigenous people from the community of\nInfierno and they took me in. And as we got close, they\nstarted saying, you know, you can come with us on\nour annual hunting trip. And I went okay. And it's four guys in a boat, and you don't wanna get your clothes wet, so we're all in our boxers\nin a canoe with a motor going out past the places that have names, and you're out in the\nmiddle of the jungle. And the thing is like\nwhen your motor breaks, you are so quickly reminded of the inherent truths, like the things that\nnobody can argue with. And we live in such a human world where everything is debatable, religion and politics and\nperspectives on everything. And then you get down to\nthis point where it's like, if we don't figure something out, the river is going to\nrise and take the boat. That's the truth, and ain't nobody gonna\nlike argue with that. And it's like, to me there's\na beauty in that truth because then all of us are\nunited there in that truth against like the natural facts around us. And so to me, that's a state where I\nfeel very, very at home. - And the Amazon is more efficient\nthan most places on earth at swallowing you up. - Oh God, yeah.\n- Okay. (both chuckles) So just to linger on that because you've spoken about\nFrancisco de Orellana, who's this explorer in 1541 and 42 that sailed the length of the Amazon, probably one of the first. And there's just a few things\nI should probably read. I should probably find a good book on him because the guy seems like a gangster. - [Paul] Yes, there's\nsome great books on him. - So he sailed, he led the expedition\nthat sailed all the way from one end to the other, there's like a rebuilding of a ship. - [Paul] Which is insanity. - Yeah. So because it speaks to the thing, it's like nobody's gonna come\nand rescue you, you have to. If your boat dies, you\ngotta have to rebuild it. - Yeah, so they came down the Andes, entered in the headwaters of the Amazon, constructed some sort of\nraft boat, craft something, and made it down the entire Amazon Basin. Of course his stories are the ones that led to the Amazon\nbeing called the Amazon because he reported tribes of women, he reported these large cities, places where the tribes lived\non farms of river turtles that they corralled and they\nlived off of that protein. And then when they came out\nto the mouth of the Amazon, if I remember it correctly, that just through\nnavigation and the stars, they were able to calculate\nwhere the way was back to Spain and make a boat seaworthy\nenough to bring them home. Incredible. Absolutely. - Do people like that inspire\nyou, your own journey? Like, what gives you kind of strength that in these harshness of times and harshness of conditions\nyou can persevere? - Yeah, I mean, you look\nat the stories of people that are so, you know, these stories of people that have overcome incredible suffering like\nthat or like, you know, what Shackleton did or\nsomething like that. And so like when your, you know, your tent gets washed away, you go to sleep and\nthe river rises 20 feet and washes away your tent. And you crawl out and\nall you have is a machete and a headlamp, literally\nno bag, no food, no nothing. And you go, wow, the next six days before I reach back to a town\nis gonna be just pure hell. I'm gonna be sleeping on\nthe ground covered in ants, destroyed by mosquitoes. And then it becomes, you\nknow, am I in any capacity, any percentage as tough\nand resilient as the people that I've read about that\nhave made it through things far worse than this? And then that's the game you play. - What goes through your head when all you got is the\nheadlamp and the machete? So are you thinking at all? Like, I've gotten a chance to interact quite a lot with Elon Musk and he constantly puts out fires having to run several companies. There's never a kind of whiny\ndeliberation about issues, you're just always one\nstep forward how to solve, this is the situation,\nhow do you solve it. Or do you also have a\nkind of self-motivating, almost egotistical, like,\nI'm a bad motherfucker, I can handle anything, almost like trying to fake it till you make it kind of thing? - There was a little bit of that. - [Lex] With your machete in the hand. - I got a sword. There may may have been\na little bit of that when I was like 14, 15 years old, I'd like have a hunting knife and my dog and I'd go out into the\nwoods in like the Catskills and survive for a weekend, which my rule was one match. You know, you get one match\nand you gotta make shelter and then, I'd bring like a steak and make a fire and stuff. And at that point there\nmaybe was some ego, but in the Amazon you get stripped down so completely that you, it's like that thing like, you know, watch the atheism leave everyone's body when they think they're about to die. It's like when you find yourself staring up at the Amazon\nat night and you go there is no hope of getting outta here. I mean, I was once lost in a\nswamp where it took me days to get out of there. And there was moments where I just said, you know, this is clearly it. There's no ego there, there's just hope. You start realizing what you believe in, and praying that you'll be okay, and then trying to summon\nwhatever you know about how to survive, and that's it. And so it's actually, again, it's kind of a blissful state if you can walk that line\nbetween adventure and tragedy and sort of keep yourself right\nat that very, very fine line without going over. - Ever fear of death? Ever fear, terror? - No, I don't want to die. I wanna, you know, I love the people in my life and there's a lot of things I want to do, but every time I've been\ncertain that I'm gonna die, I've been very, very calm. Very calm, and just sort of like, okay, well if this is how the movie goes then this is how it goes. - [Lex] Almost accepting.\n- Yeah. Which is reassuring. - You've mentioned Herzog, just to venture down this road\nof death and fear and so on. There's been a few mad men\nlike you in this world, he's documented a couple of them. What lessons do you\ndraw from \"Grizzly Man\" or \"Into The Wild,\"\nthose kinds of stories? Were you ever afraid that\nyou'll be one of those stories? - Oh yeah. I actually think\nthat it's in \"Mother of God\" where I said I almost\n\"Into The Wild\"ed myself. Like, I went out there and really, I got so lost and so destroyed that I said this is gonna be the next one. You know, this is gonna be the\nnext story of some idiot kid from New York who went to the Amazon thinking he was Percy\nFawcett and then vanished. Because if you do vanish out there, your body's gonna be\nconsumed in a matter of days, like, two. If we see an animal dead on a trail, you got dung beatles and\nfly larva and vultures, and there's a whole pecking order, you know, you get the black vultures, the yellow vultures, the king\nvulture, they all come in. That thing is picked\nclean in a couple of days. - What would be the creature\nthat eats most of you in that situation? - Probably the vultures.\n- [Lex] The vultures? - Probably the vultures and the maggots. It's really quick. It's really, really quick. Even as far as like you\ncan't leave food out, you know, like if you\nhave a piece of chicken, you say, \"Oh, I'll eat it in\nthe morning,\" you leave it out. You can't do that, it's\nnot good by morning. - \"Grizzly Man\" for example, like what? 'Cause that's a beautiful story. It's both comical and genius, and especially the way Herzog tells it. Well, first do you like\nthe way he told the story? Do you like Herzog? - I do. I love Herzog, and\nI love his documentary, the \"Burden of Dreams,\" which is in the Amazon not\nvery far from where I work. And the sheer madness that\nyou see this man undergoing of just trying to recreate\nhauling a boat over a mountain, is wild. And the extras that he\nhired to play the natives are the, I think, they're\nMachiguenga tribesmen. They just look like all the\nguys that I hang out with. And it's like, you know, they're doing all this\nstuff in the jungle that months and months and months, and you can just see him\ndeteriorating with madness because the jungle, you know, your boat, you know how many times\nI've tied up a boat to the side of the river? This just happened like\na year and a half ago. Through COVID I pretty much\njust lived in the jungle for a while. And there was nobody there\nand there was no support. And I tied up my boat, and\nthe rain is just hammering, like the universe is trying\nto rip the earth in half. The rain is just going\nand the river's rising, and I tied up the boat. But then you go to sleep and you gotta wake up every\ntwo hours to go check the boat, and the boat is thrashing back and forth. And so all night, every two\nhours I'd wake up barefoot in driving rain, like, you\nknow, golf ball raindrops and just go down, check the boat. And then by morning I was like, I fell asleep, woke up, checked the boat. And then I was like, I'm\njust gonna go make coffee, I was so done, I was so at the end of my rope every time I'm bailing\nthe boat out and stuff. And then we got 15 minutes of heavy rain that filled the boat, sank it. And so now I'm stuck\nup there with no boat. And it's like that type\nof thing where it's like, no matter how hard you try\nthe jungle's just like, \"Listen, you're nothing. You are nothing.\" And so it's that constant reminder. And so Herzog really threw\nhimself into that, in that Film, and it's brilliant to watch. - What do you think he meant by the line that you include in your book, \"It's a land that God, if he exists, has created in anger,\" said in a German accent. - Yeah, overwhelming\nand collective murder. (both laughs) - So he didn't really appreciate\nthe beauty of the murder? - I think he appreciated it,\nbut to him it was very dark. You know, I think he\nsaw the darkness in it, and that's there, it sure is. As soon as you do ayahuasca, that door opens and you see the darkness 'cause it brings you\nright into the jungle, like the heart of it. But I think that for him, it is, I think that darkness is\nsomething that he embraces and that he loves. There's another film of his, and I don't know if this is accurate, but my memory has it\nthat there's a penguin, and I think it's in Antarctica, and the penguin's going\nin the wrong direction, away from the ocean. And I feel like he goes\non this monologue about how he's just had enough. This one penguin is just\nmarching towards, you know. - Yeah. Well, because I remember that clip from that documentary. And what Werner says is that\nthe penguin is deranged, that he's lost his mind. And I took offense to that because maybe that's a brave explorer. Like, how do you know there's\nnot a lot more going on? Like, it could be a love story, those penguins get super attached. - Maybe his mate was over there and he had to go find her, like, you know. - Or it's a lost mate, and he last time he saw was going in that direction. So this is like the great explorer. We assume animals are like\nthe average of the bell curve, like every animal we interact\nwith is just the average, but they're special ones, just\nlike there's special humans. That could be a special penguin. - It could have been. And\nI had the same thought where I was like, I found it beautiful\nhow he interpreted it. What I took away from\nthat was I found that Werner Herzog's monologue there was brilliantly dark and also comedic, but maybe irrelevant biologically\nspeaking towards penguins, like, you know, which\nhappens a lot with animals. I find like, there's so many times where I'll find people be like, \"Do you think that animals\ncan show compassion?\" And you hear like a bunch of people that have never left the\npavement talking about like, \"Wow, this one animal\nhelped another animal.\" It's like, go ask Jane Goodall if animals can show compassion. Go talk to anybody that works on a daily basis with animals. And so like to me, there's a always a\nlittle bit of frustration in hearing people sort of\nlike pleasantly surprised that animals aren't just these automatons of just, what's the word? Like, programmed, you know, nothingness. - First of all, what have\nyou learned about life from Jane Goodall? 'Cause she spoke highly of your book and you lister her as one of the mentors. But what kind of wisdom about\nanimals do you draw from her? - The wisdom from Jane is so diverse. I mean, first of all, she's\nsomeone that, you know, the work that she did at\nat the time she did it was so incredible because I\nmean, she was out there at a very young age doing that field work. She was naming her subjects, which everyone said you shouldn't do. She broke every rule,\nshe broke every rule. She was assigning, and everyone said, \"You're anthropomorphizing these animals by saying that they're\ndoing this and that.\" She was like, no, they're interacting. They're showing love,\nthey're showing compassion, they're showing hate,\nthey're showing fear. And she broke straight\nthrough all of those things, and it paid off in dividends for her. - Do you see the animals\nas having all those human-like emotions of anger,\nof compassion, of longing, of loneliness from what you've seen especially with mammals, but with different species out\nthere? Do they have all that? - It depends on the animal. If you're talking on\nthe scale of a cockroach to an elephant, you know, it's\nlike a lot of these things, and I wonder about this\nstuff all the time. You know, I'll have a\npraying mantis on my hand then just go, \"What is\ngoing through your mind?\" Or you'll see a spider make\na complex decision and go, \"I'm gonna make my web there.\" You know, and you go, how are\nyou doing this? How are you? Because he made a calculation\nthere, you know, it's smart. I was in the jungle not that\nlong ago and I was walking. And all of a sudden this dove comes flying through the\njungle right up to my face, lands on a branch, like\nright here, right next to me. I look at the dove, dove looks at me. And she's like, \"Hey.\" And she's clearly, like, panting. And I'm like, why are you\nso close? This is weird. And she's like, \"I know.\" And then, an ornate hawk-eagle\nflies up 10-feet away, looks at both of us and just like scowls, and like sticks up its head feathers and then just flies off. And the dove is like, \"Sweet, thanks,\" and then flew in the other direction. And I was like, \"Dude, you just\nused me to save your life.\" The dove knew. - See. But this is what, because there's different, you know, there's Mike Tyson and\nthere's Albert Einstein. And I sometimes I wonder when\nI look at different creatures, even insects, like, is this\nMike Tyson or is this Einstein? Or other kinds of personal, like, is this a New Yorker\nor is this a Midwesterner? Or is this like a San Francisco\nbarista of the insects? Like, there's all kinds of personalities, you never know, so you can't like project. If you run into a bear\nand he's very angry, it could be just the asshole New Yorker. - Yeah, sure.\n(Lex chuckles) What are you saying\nabout New Yorkers, man? - Exactly. Point well made. So speaking about\ncommunicating with a dove, you first met the crew in the Amazon. You talk about JJ as somebody who can communicate with animals. What do you think JJ\nis able to see and hear and feel that others don't, that he's able to\ncommunicate with the animals? - When I say this is the most skilled jungle man I've ever seen, and I know so many guys in the region. He has libraries of\ninformation in his cranium that we cannot fathom, it's just stunning. Like, you know, I have seen him use medicinal plants to cure things that western doctors couldn't cure. I've seen him navigate in such a way that he's not using the stars, he's not using any discernible, you know. It's like when elephants, sometimes you'll watch a herd of elephants and they'll be like, \"Yo, let's\ngo. We're going this way,\" and you'll see them sort of communicate, but there's no audible sound. They'll just decide that they're going, and they all do it. JJ has this way in the jungle\nof, you know, he'll stop and he'll go, \"Wait,\" and you go, \"What is it?\" And he goes, \"There's a\nherd of peccary coming.\" And I'm like, where? Based on what? And he's like, \"Just wait, you'll see,\" and he'll sit there. - [Lex] You think that's just experience? - It's incredible experience. It's growing up barefoot in the Amazon. And the gift is that he\ncan speak fluent English. And so when I bring\ntourists and scientists or news reporters down there,\nhe can communicate with them. He's actually good on camera 'cause he doesn't care about cameras. And like for instance, we were walking up a\nstream a few months ago, and I went, \"Hey, look, Jaguar tracks.\" And he went, \"Whoa.\" And I was like, \"What, Jaguar tracks?\" And he's like, \"No, look. Look harder.\" And I was like, the toes\nare deeper than the back? And he was like, \"Uh-huh,\nand where are they?\" And I was like, \"By the water.\" And I was like, \"The Jaguar is drinking,\" it was leaning to drink. And he was like, that's right. He's like, \"Now look behind you.\" I look behind me and there's scat, there's a big log of\nJaguar shit sitting there and it's got butterflies all over it. - [Lex] Fresh?\n- Pretty fresh. And then there's another\none that's less fresh. And so he's teaching me as he does, he's just going, \"Look\nat this, look at this. Is that one as fresh as this one?\" No. And then he goes, \"Now look up.\" I look up. There's\nthree vultures above us. The kill is near us, the jaguar has been coming\nmultiple times to the river to drink as it's feasting\non whatever it killed. And he's going, \"It's within\n30 feet of us right now.\" And it's like, I'm like, oh look,\nimpression's in the sand, he's like, I just drew\n19 conclusions from that. It's like watching\nSherlock Holmes at work. - Reconstructing the crime scene. - [Paul] Incredible. - Does that apply also\nto be able to communicate with the actual animals? Like, read into their\nbody movements directly into whatever that dove was saying to you, to be able to understand? Or is that all just kind of\ntaking in the complex structure of the crime scene, of the interactions of\nthe different animals of the environment and so on? Like, what is that that you're able to communicate with another creature, that he was able to communicate\nwith another creature? - He knows the intention of pose, he knows the habits, he\nknows the perspective. When he talks about animals, he'll talk about each\nspecies as if it's a person. So he'll say, \"Oh, the Jaguar, she never likes to let you see her.\" And so he'll come back from\nthe jungle and he'll go, \"Oh, I was watching monkeys and this Jaguar was also\nwatching the monkeys, but I was being so\nquiet she didn't see me. And then when she see me,\nshe feels so embarrassed and she go.\" And he'll tell you this story like as if he had this interaction\nwith his neighbor. And he'll be like, \"Oh, the\npukakunga it never does that, you won't see it do that.\" One time he caught a fish,\nit was such a big fish, it was this big beautiful\npseudoplatystoma, this tiger catfish, this amazing old fish, and they're all excited to eat it. And I felt so bad watching\nthis thing gasp on the sand. And I went, you know what? We don't need this, this is for fun and threw it back. And then I took my hand and I went, and I made like drag marks. Like, so I could say it\nsnuck back in the water. And so he walks up, he looks at it and he\nwas like, \"I hate you.\" And I went, what? No. I said, \"It must have just.\" He went, \"That's not what happens.\" He goes, \"It goes like this when it go,\" he knew the track of a fish. And I was like, \"Oh yeah.\" I was like, \"All right, JJ, I'm sorry. I'll catch you another fish.\" - So stepping back to that way\nyou opened \"Mother of God.\" Who was Santiago Durand, and\nwhat secret did he tell you? - JJ's father was, at some point, he was a policeman, at some point when he was a teenager, he was working on the boats\nthat before this little gold mining city of Puerto Maldonado grew, the only way to get supplies in was to take canoes up the Tambopata River up to the next state, which is Puno where the mules would come\ndown from the mountains with supplies and then\nhe'd pilot the boats down. But they didn't have motors at that time, so he would be pulling the boat. So he became this\nphysically terrifying man. And I met him in when he was in his 80s and he was still living out\nin the jungle by himself. And I mean, he's seen\nan anaconda eat a tapir, which is a cow-sized mammal in the Amazon, he'd seen uncontacted tribes face-to-face. He once killed an 11-foot electric eel, opened the back of the thing's neck, removed the nerve that he says was the source of the electric. Then he cut his forearm, placed that nerve into his forearm, wrapped it with a dead toad, and claims that it would give him strength through the rest of his life. And continued to be a jungle\nbadass until the day he quietly leaned back at a\nbarbecue and ceased to be alive. The man was incredible. But the secret that he told\nus was that if you wanna find big anacondas, you know, if you wanna see the Yacumama, he was like, \"You have to go to the boayo, the place of boas, the place that we came to\ncall the floating forest. And so he sent us there and it\nbecame like this pilgrimage. You know, in the Amazon, a lot of the creation\nmyths are based around the anaconda coming down from the heavens and carving the rivers across the jungle. And if you look at the\nrivers, it looks like that, it looks like the path of an anaconda crawling through the jungle,\nit's even the right color. And so from the reference\nto the tribes of women, the Amazons to the anaconda mother, everything in the Amazon\nis very feminine based. Even the trees, the largest\ntrees in the jungle, the mother of the forest,\nthe Madre de la selva, is the kapok tree, and it's\njust this monster tree, these beautiful ancient trees. And that was the beginning\nof the transition that we made from me\nbeing like, I hate school, I want to go on adventures. You know, Jane Goodall got\nto do all this amazing stuff. I'm just a kid stuck here to eventually becoming\nsomething that had to do with where my identity became the jungle, where my life became the jungle. The secret that he told\nus opened that door, because when we started working\nwith these giant snakes, it started getting attention. It started getting people\nto go, what are you doing? And it started allowing me\nto have experiences that solidified and nailed down the fact that this wasn't just like a weekend retreat, this was something that I was born to do. - And gave you more and more motivation to go into these uncharted territory of the Yacumama?\n- [Paul] Yacumama. - Which, just to step back, what nations are we talking about here? Some geography, what are we talking about? Where is this? - [Paul] So I'm in Peru, we're in Peru. - Which is a South American nation. - Peru is a South American nation. Brazil has 60% of the Amazon, which is unfortunate because\nanything that happens politically in Brazil has a\nmassive impact on the Amazon. Peru has the western Amazon, and Ecuador has a little\nbit of the western Amazon. The western Amazon is\nwhere the Andes mountains, the cloud forests, which\nis a megabiodiverse biome, falls into the western Amazon lowlands. And so you have the meeting of\nthese two incredible biomes, and that's what makes this\nlike superlative, incredible, you know, glowing moment of life on earth. So yeah, we're in Peru\nin the Madre de Dios, which is the mother of God, which I always thought was\nsuch a beautiful, you know, the jungle is the source of all life. And so we were with the Ese-Eja people, and they belong to a community\nthat's called Infierno, which was given by the missionaries who when they tried to go\nbring these people Jesus, got so many arrows shot at them they just called it hell. And so, Santiago Durand\nhelped unite these tribes that were sort of scattered\nthrough the jungle and get them status,\ngovernment-recognized status as indigenous people. So he was sort of a hero, he was sort of a legend for\na lot of the stuff he'd done out barefoot with just like a rifle and a machete in the jungle. He had 19 children, and the last one, I think the\n20th child that he adopted was a refugee from the Shining Path that floated down the river, and he just took him in. This is just a guy that was a, you know, everything he did, like when he died, the whole region showed up. He was somebody, so just\nthe fact that I know him gives me street credit. Like, the fact that I knew him, I can go like, oh, I knew Santiago and people are like, no. I'm like, yeah, yeah. - So you had to get\nintegrated to the culture, to the place that mean,\nin every single way, which is tough for you\nbeing from New York. - Yeah. It could have been tough, but I took to it. You know, the jungle, they were very, you know, JJ's teaching me about medicines and we were doing bird\nsurveys and, you know, taking data on macaw populations. JJ was just like, \"You really wanna,\" like, he goes, \"You gotta sleep.\" And I was like, \"I only\nhave a few weeks here, I don't know if I'm ever gonna come back, I'm never going to sleep.\" So we'd be out every night looking for all the wildlife we could. I wanted to take photos,\nI wanted to see things. And then, the exchange came with that, he was like, \"I'm terrified of snakes.\" And I said, \"Oh, I've\nalways worked with snakes.\" I said, \"I'll teach you\nhow to handle snakes.\" And then we just had this\nlike little exchange. And then when I left, after\nmy first time back in 2006, you know, I said, \"How can I help?\" And they were like, look, you know, we're out here trying to protect this little island of forest\nthat is going to be bulldozed. And the more people that you can bring, the more knowledge and the more awareness that you can bring to this, it'll help. And so really at that\nage, at 18 years old, I sort of started dabbling\nwith the idea of that I could be part of helping these people to protect this place that I loved. And of course, at that time, that idea seemed like too large of a dream or too large of a challenge to that I could actually impact it. - So what was the journey of\nlooking for these giant snakes, of looking for anacondas?\nAnd what are anacondas? - Anaconda is the largest snake on earth. So you have reticulated\npythons in southeast Asia, they're actually longer, but anacondas are these massive\nboas, they give live birth. And unlike a lot of other species, so an anaconda starts off,\na little two-foot anaconda, just a little thicker than\nyour finger, a little baby. And they're food for cane\ntoads, herons, crocodiles, you name it, they're pretty\nharmless, defenseless. But as they grow, they're eating the fish, they're eating the crocs. And then they grow a little more and they're eating things like capybara and they're eating larger prey. And then at the end of their\nlife, a female anaconda, you're talking about a 25, 30-foot, 300, 400-pound snake with a\nhead bigger than a football. And these things, that\nmeans that they impact the entire ecosystem,\nwhich is very unique. - [Lex] Moves up the food\nchain to become basically-- - An apex predator.\n- [Lex] Yeah, apex predator. - The apex predator of the rivers, and so. - That's so interesting, just eating your way up the food chain. - Eating your way up the food\nchain, if you can survive. And like they're constantly\nat war with everything else. So I showed up in the Amazon, I was like, so where the anacondas at? And they were like, oh,\nno, no, it's not like that. They're like, you have\nto find these things. They're subterranean, they're\nliving in the special swamps. People kill them. And so we went to the floating forest after we'd come back from an expedition. We'd caught like a 12-foot anaconda. And now it's become like\nthis like classic photo of me and JJ with this\nanaconda over our shoulders. And we were like, you know,\n12 days out in the jungle on a hunting trip, we came back and we showed his dad. And Santiago looked at us and he was like, \"That's the smallest anaconda\non deep dive I've ever seen.\" He's like, you guys are pathetic. - [Lex] Oh man, 12 foot. - And he was like, \"Look, you go.\" He was like, go. He's like, \"I'm giving you permission. Go to the boayo, go to\nthe floating forest.\" And so we went to this place, and we reached there at night. And it was me, JJ and one of his brothers. And his brother took one look\nat it and was like, \"I'm out,\" and he started walking back. And me and JJ get to\nthe edge of this thing, and this is our friendship,\nit's about this two idiots pushing each other farther and farther. And like, I like put a foot on\nthe ground and it all shook, and the stars are\nreflecting on the ground. And what we realize is that it's a lake with floating grass on top of it. And there's islands of\ngrass floating on this lake, very \"Life of Pie,\" and the tops of trees\nare coming out of the surface of the water. And so we start walking\nacross this, and JJ's going, \"These are big anacondas.\" And I'm going, \"JJ, that's\na two-foot wide smooth path sneaking through the grass.\nThere's no anaconda that big.\" And he was going, \"Shh,\nthey're listening.\" I said, \"They don't have ears.\" He goes, \"They're listening.\" And it's like, we're\nwalking and we're walking, maybe it's like 1:00 AM or something. And it was just like one of those moments where we saw it at the same time. And we were standing by the tail. And the snake was so big that, I mean, this must have been a\n25-foot anaconda dead asleep, with a probably a 16-foot\nanaconda sprawled across her. And they're laying in the starlight and we're floating on top of a lake standing there in the\nmiddle of the Amazon. And JJ just, I could feel the\nblood drain outta his face. And as like a however old\nI was, maybe 20 years old, I just said, \"If we could\nsomehow show people this, we'll be on the front cover\nof National Geographic and we can protect all\nthe jungle that we want.\" And so I tried to catch it. Yeah, so I jumped on the snake and the only measurement I\nhave of this animal is that when I wrapped my arms around it, I couldn't touch my fingers. And so I was, you know,\nmy feet were dragging. And to her credit, this\nanaconda did not turn around and eat me 'cause her head\nwas, you know, this big. And she went, and she reached\nthe edge of the grass island, and she starts plunging into the dark. And so I'm watching the stars vibrate as this anaconda is going. And I had to make the choice\nof either going headfirst down into the black, which, no thank you, or stopping and just keeping\nmy hand on this thing as it raced by me. And I just felt the scales\nand the muscle and the power go by and then eventually\ntapered down to the tail until it slipped away into the darkness. And I was laying there, just panting. And then I turned around and\nwent, \"JJ, what the fuck? Where were you man?\" He was just like completely\nwhite, circuits blown, and I had to go and kind\nof like take care of him. I was like, \"Are you okay?\" And he was like, \"No.\" You know, he just couldn't. And so we came back with that. And then after that we were like, okay, clearly the parameters of reality that we thought were possible\nare just a tiny fraction of what's out there. That sort of recalibrated us, we were like, okay. We're rubbing up against things that are bigger than we\nthought were ever possible. And so we were like, okay, now we need to concentrate on this. - So how dangerous is\nthat creature to humans? - To humans, not at all. Our cook's father-in-law\nwas eaten by an anaconda, but like, you know. - Love the way you say that and tell that story. Sometimes it happens. - It happens. I mean, come on, every now and then somebody\ngets stung by a bee and dies. Like, you know, once\nin a while it happens. But you gotta have a really\nbig anaconda really hungry. And like, anybody that works in the wild, I mean just, you know. If you walk up to a crocodile, even a giant Nile crocodile,\nyou walk up to them, most of the time they're\ngonna run into the water. They don't want confrontation, they hunt in their way\non their terms, sneaky, you're not gonna see him. And so with an anaconda, it's like, yeah. I mean the guy who got eaten, like if you're drunk and you\ngo to the edge of the water and you go for a midnight swim by yourself in an Amazonian lake, I\nmean, whose fault is that? - But if you jump on an\nAnaconda, try to hold on, then you're safe. - Apparently. I think at this point, the research we've done, I\nthink I've handled or caught over 80 anacondas in the field, and not one of them has bitten me. They always choose flight over fight. They're like, just leave\nme alone, let me go. I'm just gonna crawl under this thing. They're not an aggressive\nanimal, I mean, no snake. The only time I get particular\nwith like, you know, the words is like, people\ngo, that's an aggressive, black mambas are aggressive. And I go, no snake is aggressive. A rattlesnake is gonna\nrattle to say, hey, back up, cobra's gonna stand up\nand show you it's hood. And people go, \"Oh look,\nhe's being aggressive.\" No, he's not being aggressive, He's going, don't step on\nme, don't make me do this. They're actually being very peaceful, that's the way I look at it. 'Cause if there was a cobra\nin the corner of this room right now, he would\ncrawl under the curtain and we'd never see him again. - Yeah, it's like Genghis Khan before conquering the villages, he always offered for\nthem to join the army. - Doesn't need to be like this. - Yeah, join us, nobody gets destroyed. If you want to be proud\nand fight for your country, then we're gonna have to deal with it. - Oblige him. - Exactly, okay. So how do you catch, actually let's step back because there is, in part you are a bit\nof a snake whisperer. What is it that others don't understand that you do about snakes? What's maybe a misconception? Or what have you learned\nfrom the language you speak that snakes understand? - I don't know. It's an\nanimal that has many times in my life I've been\nresponsible for helping. I started catching snakes\nwhen I was very young, I'd watch Steve Irwin and go\nout and catch a garter snake or a black rat snake in New York. And then I had a rule. I said I have to catch a\nhundred non-venomous snakes before I'm allowed to\nhandle a venomous snake, if I ever need to handle a venomous snake. And then, I was on a trail one time, I think in Harriman State Park. And some guy, like some big\nhero, he tells us, you know, he is like, \"Back up, I'm gonna get this.\" And he like picks up a\nstick and he goes to assault this poor copperhead that's\nsitting on the trail. And so, at like 16 years old, I had to go and shoulder\nthis guy out of the way and I got the thing by the tail and used a stick to very gently\njust put it off the trail. Copperhead was not gonna\ndo anything to him, but he wanted to beat his chest and show his wife that he was tough. But then in India, you know, I've lived in India for\nfive years at this point in and out, periodically, and snakes are always getting\ninto people's kitchens. One time we had a king cobra\nget into someone's kitchen, an 11-foot snake, like a\nmonster, like a god of a snake. This thing stood up, it would stand up, he'd be able to look\nat you over the table. (Lex laughs) And this terrifying monster thing, this giant gorilla dog thing, like we caught it with one\nof the local snake catchers and we brought it out and he goes, \"You know, \"I wonder why\nit was in the kitchen.\" And I went, yeah, looking for food. And they go, no, they eat snakes. King cobra, ophiophagus\nhannah, they eat snakes. And he goes, \"She's thirsty.\" And so we got a bottle of water, and we got footage of this. She's standing up, she's going, \"Don't make me kill you,\ndon't make me kill you. You're scaring me right now,\nI don't want to kill you.\" We took the bottle of water\nand we poured it on her nose and she started drinking. You could see her just drinking, and the snake just took this long drink, she drank a whole water bottle. And then said thank you\nso much, and crawled off. And it's like, to me, the fact that people are scared of snakes, they have symbolic hatred of snakes, you know, if someone's evil and sneaky, we call them a snake. And like to me it's like,\nwhen I take volunteers or researchers or students\nout into the jungle and we find an emerald tree\nboa or an Amazon tree boa, or a vine snake. It's one of the few animals, like you can't really catch\na bird and show it to people, you're gonna scare the bird, its feathers are gonna come out, you might give it a heart attack. Snakes, you can lift up a snake. You know, if there's a\nsnake in the room right now, I could lift it up and say, Lex, here, this is how you hold it, and we could interact\ncalmly with this thing and then put it back on its\nbranch and then it'll go. And I've seen what that does to people, I've seen how the wonder in their eyes. And so to me snakes have always\nbeen this incredible link to teach people about\nwildlife, about nature. - Because they have\nnaturally a lot of fear towards this creature and to realize that the\nfear is not justified, is not grounded, or is not as\ndeeply grounded in reality. Of course there's always\nNew Yorker snakes, right? There's always gonna be an\nasshole snake here and there. - Coming for me, man.\n(Lex laughs) - Well, okay, so back to the anaconda. How do you catch an anaconda? How do you handle, because\nit's such a 25-foot or even 12-foot, these giant snakes. How do you deal with this creature? How do you interact with them? - We had to learn how to do that 'cause one of the first ones\nwe caught that I would say maybe like a 16 footer,\nwhich is no joke of a snake, girth of a basketball, I'd say. You know, we're on the canoe, and this is the early days. Like, you know, now we're\nat a whole different level, but this is back when we\nwere barefoot and shirtless and just guys in the Amazon. And JJ's like, you know,\nI just listen to him. He'd be like, \"Get off the\nboat, you come from the top, we're gonna come from the bottom.\" So okay, I just did as I was told. I came in, the snake is\nall curled up, dead asleep. She's got some butterflies on her eyes trying to get salt and stuff. And all of a sudden I see the tongue, and I'm like, \"She's awake.\" And I'm like, \"Guys, guys, guys.\" They're paying attention\nto not crashing the boat to getting over there, and\nwe're all trying to run. Snake starts going into the water, so I run ahead, grab this\nsnake, get her by the head. So you got her by the head, you think, okay, she can't get me. I got her right behind the head and it's about this thick, the neck. - What's that feel like,\nsorry to interrupt, like grabbing this thing\nwith this giant head? - [Paul] It's exciting,\nit's amazing, it's scary. - How hard is it to hold? - It's not that hard to hold. The scary part is the moment of, it's like if you've ever done\na cliff dive or something, it's that moment where\nyou go, do it, do it, the time, like do it. And if your body's\ngoing, \"Do not do that,\" and then you're like, I gotta\njust do it, and you do it. - Because you can't just\ngently flirt with it, you have to grab the thing.\n- No. And it's like crossing the\nstreet when there's a bus coming. It's like, if you hesitate\nit's more dangerous. So like, you go for it. And I got her, and I\nwas like, \"I got her.\" And then a coil goes over my wrists. And all of a sudden my\nwrists slap together, and you feel this squeeze\nthat can crush the bones out of an animal bigger than me. And the next coil comes\nvery quickly over my neck. And now I'm on my knees with my arms tied, if I wanted to let go of\nthe snake, I couldn't. And my shoulders are coming together and my collarbone is about to break. And I tried to yell for JJ and\nall that came out was, \"Ugh,\" there's nothing. And so that's what they do\nto their prey, you know? So I attacked, as far as\nthe snake knows, I attacked. She doesn't know that I\njust wanna measure her. - You started out as the big spoon, but then the snake became the big spoon. - The snake very much\nbecame the big spoon. I would say I was 15 seconds away from having my entire ribcage collapsed, and then JJ showed up and grabbed the tail and just started unwrapping\nthis thing, and then we got. But now we have a system, now we know, you know. I've gotten more head\ncatches than anybody, so I'm usually point guy. - You're the first, the point guy. - [Paul] I'm the point guy.\n- Okay. Taking the big risky first step. - Yes. Although it could be argued that there's a similarly large\nrisk for the tail guy because anacondas' defense is to take a giant projectile shit. And so the person that gets the tail is gonna smell like anaconda\nfor at least a week. - Yeah, so it's the least pleasant. You're taking the most\ndangerous one there. They have the least pleasant job, but this is fascinating. - But what's really\nfascinating though is that because they're the apex\npredator, they're eating the fish, they're eating the birds,\nthey're eating everything. And everything in this\nriparian ecosystem is absorbing the mercury that's coming off\nthe gold mining in the region. And so anacondas can be indicative for us of how is mercury moving\nthrough this ecosystem. And this is a region where\nwe've lost hundreds of thousands of acres to artisanal gold\nmining where they use mercury to bind the gold. They cut the forest, burn the forest, and then they run water through the sand and the sand particles\nhave bits of gold in it. Not chunks, but just little, almost microscopic flex of gold, and then they use the\nmercury to bind that. And then they burn off the mercury, and that vapor goes up into the clouds. So just like everything else,\nit's all connected down there, and then rains down into the rivers. And so the people in the\nregion are having birth defects from the amount of mercury\nthat's in the water. And so we were starting, at one point when we were doing most of our anaconda research, we were learning things like, these animals actually\naren't just ambush predators, which is what most of the\nliterature would tell you, is that anacondas are ambush predators, no, they actually go hunting. They'll go find clay\nlakes and salt deposits and they'll wait there, they'll\nactually pursue animals. And we were trying to take\ntissue samples to find out if anacondas could be used to study how mercury's moving through the ecosystem. And so that was really, it became, can we use these animals\nnot only as ambassadors for wildlife, because everybody\nwants to see the anacondas, but also, you know, what can\nwe learn from studying this very, very little\nunderstood apex predator. - And one of the things you can learn is how mercury moves through the ecosystem, which can damage the ecosystem in all kinds of different ways. - Yeah, it's brutal man, the gold mining that's\nhappening down there is. It's funny 'cause we've\nbeen hearing a lot recently about like the cobalt mines in Africa. And it's like, where we are in the Amazon, we were down there with ABC News I wanna say like a year and a half ago with my friend Matt Gutman, who's the chief correspondent for ABC. He wanted to see the Amazon fires, he wanted to see some wildlife, he wanted to see the areas\nthat we're protecting. And then he goes, \"I wanna\nsee the gold-mining areas.\" And I'd never gotten in so deep, but we met this Russian guy, you can't go, the Peruvian, they will kill you. Like, our lawyer's father was assassinated for standing up to the gold miners. There was two Russian guys though who had a legal mining concession somehow way out past the machine gun guarded limit of the Pampas, which is where\nthey do all this gold mining. And we got in there and\ntook footage of the desert that is forming in what used to be the headwaters of the Amazon rainforest. And it's like there is\na massive global scale ecological crime happening down there that you can see from space from this unregulated gold mining. And the cops can't go there\n'cause they will be murdered, it's completely lawless. - What's the machine gun limit exactly? - It's the border of this area\nthat they call the Pampas, which is where the rainforest has been cut and completely destroyed, and it looks like Mars, it's just sand. And inside of this area are gold miners. We tried to get in there to film years ago and there's just a lot\nof guys with machine guns who don't let that happen. - And what, the Russian guys have-- - The Russian guys had access somehow. They'd come down with a bit of money and they had a new system, yeah. And actually, what was interesting\nis while I was in there, they're very friendly, and really, really two\nfriendly gold miners. One of them while I was there, you know, he kind of tapped me on the shoulder. He was like, you know,\n\"Look at those guys.\" He was like, \"Those guys over there\" he goes, \"I just heard\nthem say your name.\" And he goes, \"That's not a good thing.\" He goes, \"They know exactly who you are.\" He goes, \"I wouldn't\nkeep posting to Instagram about gold mining in the Amazon.\" And I was like, okay,\nthanks for the warning. And then, you know, in June\nsomebody pulled up beside me on a motorcycle and I\ngot a more stern warning. - They pay attention to\nthe flow of information 'cause they don't want\nthe world to find out. - Oh, the last thing they\nwant is to be shut down. But the gold miners are\nnotorious for, you know, just whacking people and\nthrowing them in a pile of gold mining leftovers. The Peruvian government\nhas to get the military to go after them. Like, the work we've\ndone with gold miners, converting them into\nconservationists has all been like, I mean I've seen the\nPeruvian navy come down and literally blow up gold mining barges, and, you know, it's a war. It's a war being fought in the Amazon. - So it's possible to convert\nthem into conservationists? What's that process like? Or is that like, you say that in jest? - No, I say that in absolute sincerity. We went upriver, up the Malinowski\nRiver several years ago, and I think it was 2018. And everyone was like,\nyou are going to die. Like, you will be shot and killed. And the reason we were able\nto do it with relative safety was that the gold miner\nthat we were going with was the brother-in-law of one of my closest friends\ndown there, our expedition chef and one of the directors of Junglekeepers. And they said, \"Look, you can\ngo, just keep a low profile.\" And so I went up with a photographer and we spent a week there. Dead animals everywhere,\ndeforestation everywhere. I mean the things that\nwe saw were so horrible. And we're living with these\ngold miners that are, you know, they're getting their gold,\nthey're burning off the mercury. I watched the guy smoking a cigarette, burning the mercury off of his gold with the vapor going\nstraight into his face with his child right there. I mean, unbelievable\nnegligence of just sanity. And then towards the end of the week, the Peruvian navy comes down the river and everyone starts scrambling. And I was like, I'm just gonna\nsit here with my hands up 'cause, you know. And they didn't even stop. They found the gold mining barge, you know, they have a\nfloating thing in the river that just plumbs the bottom of the river, just sucks all the sediment up. And they stopped and they\nstrapped a bunch of explosives to this motor. And good lord, the\nsound of this explosion. And there was just hot metal raining down all over the place, and\nthen they just went. A bunch of guys in fatigues and they just kind of like\nlooked at us, like, peace. And I sat there with this gold\nminer and I went, now what? And he went, \"Well, now I\ngotta go get a new motor.\" And I went, \"Why don't you\njust do something else?\" And he goes, \"What else is there?\" And I went, \"Look what we do.\" And I sat there with my\nphone and I was like, \"See this? These are pretty tourists. And we feed them food and we show them tarantulas and macaws.\" And he looked at this and he went, wow. He goes, \"That looks like so much fun.\" And I went, \"It is so much fun.\" I said, we show people, we\nbring students to the jungle. He goes, \"So you're saying\nif I build you a lodge you'll bring people?\" I said yeah. And I came back a year later and he sat there with a chainsaw, a hand saw and some nails. And he cut down like 17 palm trees and he built an ecotourism lodge. - So you give him another\nchannel of survival, of making money.\n- [Paul] Yes. And that's what we've been\ndoing through Junglekeepers for loggers and for all kinds\nof extractors is just saying, look, what do you make? You make $15 a day\ndestroying the ancient trees of the jungle? What if we paid you $35 a day to have a uniform and a\njob and health insurance and security, and you just protect it? And use all of the jungle\nknowledge you've gained as a logger to protect this place. - Who are the loggers trying\nto destroy the Amazon? Can you say a little bit more about it? Is that as a threat to\nthe Amazon rainforest? - A lot of them are really\nclose friends of mine. They're people that need to make a living, and they're jungle people who, you know, the rainforest is a very challenging, especially the Amazon is a\nvery challenging environment. And so you have these people who, they have a chainsaw, they have a job opportunity, they go out and they cut the trees. And a lot of these guys grew up fishing, they grew up in the jungle,\nthey know how to do it. And so for them it's a way\nto like, they also love it. So this is the thing,\nthese are outdoorsmen, these are guys that love the jungle. You know, in the 90s we\nhad the mahogany boom where they went out after the mahogany, and you almost can't find a mahogany tree in the jungle anymore. And if you wanna talk about\nlike carbon sequestration in the rainforest, the ancient\nhardwoods hold like 60% of the carbon of the whole rainforest. They have an outsized\ndisproportionate mess from that ancient density of the wood. And so these loggers go\nout and they cut the wood that's most valuable and then\nthey bring it back to town and they sell it. And then people like us buy it and put it on our kitchen floors. So the thing is, you know, when I got to the Amazon it was, you know, loggers are the bad guys. And if you talk to a lot of\nthe PhDs that I worked with down there were always very\nat odds with the miners, at odds with the loggers. And then I'd be with JJ,\nand JJ would sit down, and he'd be like, \"Hey,\nlet's pour a drink.\" Oh, they have masato, let's all sit down.\" And like we'd all be chilling\nand throwing 'em back with a bunch of loggers. And then the opportunity through\nnot vilifying these people came to be like, these guys are great. You know, and then of\ncourse out in the wild, every now and then something will happen, you'll see somebody's boat flipped over and you go help 'em out and then that creates a\ncertain type of kinship. - So they're ultimately people who love the same thing you love. - Often, yeah. Even if they don't love\nit, they're people that aren't necessarily looking to destroy it. I've met loggers who have looked at trees they're about to cut and\ngone, ah, this is a shame. Start it up. You know, they're just like, this is where the paycheck comes from. - Let's come back briefly to anacondas. Can you tell me this whole situation with Discovery's \"Eaten Alive?\" There's some drama and\ncontroversy around that. Can you explain that\nwhole saga with Discovery, with your whole effort? Maybe outside of even the drama, the initial thing, which I now feel you're sufficiently insane to actually do, of being eaten by an anaconda. Is that actually possible to\nsurvive something like that? - I mean, if an anaconda swallows you while you're wearing the\nsuit that they made, maybe. But that was in hindsight\nthat was the result of, look, I go to the jungle and you start seeing\nthese beautiful places, these incredible species, you start developing a\nrelationship with these animals. And then you watch it get destroyed, every year we watch it burn, every year, places that\nare are crucial to my soul, I have seen leveled and turned to ash. And at some point we started going, someone has to do something about this. And you look to your right\nand you look to your left and there is no one 'cause\nit's the middle of the Amazon, and the rainforests have\nbeen being destroyed since the 70's, it's a cliche. And so we started trying\nto do something about it, so I started putting a\nlittle bit more emphasis on publicity, a little bit more emphasis on getting the message out there. And so I started trying to\nsee how, what was gonna work. You know, you just start firing shots in the dark and seeing. And you know, JJ's going, \"You have to help us do something,\" and I'm going, okay. And so from 18 years old,\nnow I'm 23 years old, and all of a sudden this place isn't foreign\nto me anymore, it's home. - You're trying to think\nof all the different ways you can bring attention to\nthis place that you care about that's being destroyed? - Yeah. You're standing next\nto a boulder of progress of destruction and it's\nabout to roll onto the forest and just destroy it and\nsnuff out all that life, and no one's there to\ndo anything about it. And so you go, is there any\nway that I could put myself in front of this boulder and hold it back? And you're talking about, you know, the global economic reality, it's just such a massive, it's systemic. - So what's the most dramatic\npossible thing I could do? - Exactly. So when you\nfind yourself flown to LA as a 23-year-old dude, and you're sitting there with some guy who's like spinning a pen and\ngot his feet up on the desk, and going, you know, what\ncan you show us down there? And you go, I could show\nyou the biggest anacondas in the world and we\ncould talk about mercury and bioaccumulation,\nand we could show people how these animals are misunderstood. And we go on a big expedition and we could be the coolest show ever. And he goes, \"Yeah, not good enough.\" And you go, okay, and so that cycled\nthrough a bunch of times. And someone at some point in one of those meetings\nsaid, \"What if we show people that anacondas really can eat humans?\" And I went, how is that a good show? You want me to feed\nsomeone to an anaconda? And I said, and I kind of joked, I was like, the only way that's feasible is if you make a suit\nwith a breathing apparatus and let the snake eat you\nand then come back out safely and make sure you don't hurt the snake. And they were like, \"Kid, you're on.\" And I was like, \"Oh shit.\" - So I should mention as a small tangent. I think I mentioned to you\noffline due to travel troubles, when I traveled to the totally wrong part of the United States on my way to Boston. And on my way to Boston\nI did a conversation with Mr. Beast, Jimmy. And I got a chance to hang\nout with him for the day, and one of the things we did is have a lengthy brainstorm\nsession with his team, or I was observing it. But it was interesting because\nhe's probably way better at that conversation that\nyou had with the guy in LA than the guy in LA, obviously because he's\nrevolutionizing entertainment and he's also doing philanthropy which he's trying to figure\nout how to help the world with that kind of stuff. So I would love to actually, I'll send him a message\nto see what his thoughts. Just brainstorm, he's so strong at this. Literally, take the\nsituation you're facing. Here's the place that I really care about is being burned down,\nit's being destroyed. What's the sexy video? - Yeah. Well, how do you get\npeople to watch something that's, you know, we all change a channel when\nthey show us the kids in Africa with the swollen stomachs,\nnobody wants to see it. And it's like, with the\nrainforest that like, we know, we know, we know. And I'm going, I could\ngive data all day long. I could show photos of burning forest, and so I was looking for what would do it. And so the \"Eaten Alive\" thing, without spending too much\ntime on a massive misstep was I agreed to do it. They paid me at the time more\nmoney than I had made before, which I very much needed 'cause nobody pays you\nto be a conservationist. So I was a very poor 23-year-old. It was like, \"Yes, I\nwould love that, please.\" And I thought, you know what, this is the start of a TV career. We got shafted so bad. I mean they used, somehow\nthey changed our voices, they changed the things we said, they changed the message of the film. There was one point where we\nhad caught a 19-foot snake and I was holding her head and I said, \"This is such a beautiful\nanimal, the queen of the Amazon.\" This is such a great moment for me, I kissed her on the head. I said, \"She's made so many\nbabies, look at the scars.\" I was talking about just the poetry of this incredible dragon. And then the producer goes,\n\"Yeah, yeah, that's great. Listen, if that was to bite\nyou, what would happen?\" And I was like, \"Oh, well if\nit bit you, you'd bleed out cause it would lacerate down to the,\" that's what they put in the film. They didn't show me the film until the night before I\nwent on Matt Lauer's show. And I said I am not endorsing this film. And they had called it, on the call sheet, they'd called it Expedition,\nEA, Expedition Amazon. All of a sudden they\nchanged it to \"Eaten Alive.\" And I went, \"Wait guys, wait, wait.\" I said, \"You're gonna make people think that it actually happened,\nnot that we're attempting it.\" And I said, I'm not. And then they called me and they said, \"You're going on live TV tomorrow.\" They said, \"You let us\nknow what level of control we need to show for you,\" and it was a very threatening phone call. And so I had to go out\nand smile for the cameras and endorse something\nthat was a train wreck. And the scientific community\nwas like, \"You're an idiot. We don't want to ever see you again.\" I lost a lot of opportunities. PETA came, which you know, PETA whatever, but PETA came out, people were like, you were trying to hurt a\nsnake, which I would never do. And then the American Public was like, you said you were gonna\nget eaten by a snake and you didn't. And so everyone was pissed, I basically had to exile myself to India for like six months and just. I mean, I had death threats\ncoming through all my messages, people were furious with me. - What gave you strength to that? How difficult was that, psychologically, just everything you care\nabout being completely kind of flipped upside down? - I've spent so much time on the ground with the local people\nlearning from the wildlife. It's such a devout an\nimportant thing to me, and it got turned into a sideshow. It got turned into a joke,\nand then not just a joke, it got turned into that\nI'm somehow bad to animals, I'm irresponsible scientifically. Jimmy Kimmel told me to\nhave sex with a hippo as my next stunt. Like, it was like, it got really ugly and it misfired so bad. And when you hear these\nlike motivational speakers talk about, you just gotta keep trying and sometimes you're gonna fail hard. It was like, that one\nI got hit in the head with a baseball bat, that one was tough. And at the time I was like, I'm fine. And I was like, I'm gonna\ngo away for a while. And I learned a lot though, like at this point I'm still glad I did it because man did I learn a lot about what a room full of\npeople that you don't know who could look you in the\neye and shake your hand and say, \"Trust us.\" Ooh boy. - Do you have on a human\nlevel of resentment towards Discovery, towards\nthe people involved? Are you able to forgive them? - I don't care. It literally,\nthat's what they do. You know, they literally\nput out a documentary saying that mermaids were real. - Wait a minute, wait\na minute, they're not? Listen.\n(Paul laughs) I'm not even touching that one. - [Paul] It's true, it is true. There is a documentary where they duped a bunch of scientists who are like oceanographers, and they showed them ancient footage of mariners saying that seals\nwere mermaids, who cares? I was young, I got brought to Hollywood and I got spit out the other side, and that's on me, that's not their fault. There's that parable about the frog who gives the scorpion\na ride across the water. And then at the end he says, \"I'll give you a ride,\njust don't sting me.\" And they get to the other side\nand the scorpion stings him and the frog goes, \"Why did you do that?\" And the scorpion goes, \"I'm a scorpion.\" It's not their fault. - That's in my nature. But now that you've become\nmuch more well known and much more successful at what you do, you have a platform. Can you return to those people\nand use it, the machine, to get more and more attention? Is that something you work on, or do you prefer to\nwork completely outside? - I think that most of the\nsuccess that we've had now in protecting the rainforest and it's the levels that\nwe've reached are so far. I think back to those barefoot\ndays of catching snakes with JJ and the boat. And now the massive\necological reserve we have and the team of rangers\nand the converted loggers, and all of that is because of the ability to communicate\nand to show people, but that's all been through social media. And so I'm open to the fact, you know, if somebody came and gave a\nsort of like Bordenian pass where they said, look,\nyou can be yourself. You can swear, you can\nfart, you can smoke, you can do whatever you wanna do, go out there and show us the real thing, I would love to. But now I know how those\ncontracts need to be, I need to have right to refusal\nand they can't change 'em. And so I'd almost rather\njust do it like the way, I think, like Mr. Beast does stuff, where it's like you get a crew\nof guys and some seed money and go film the episodes and put it out. I mean, a committee never\nhelped real art be better, it has to come from the\nsource of inspiration. I think, you get JJ and a crew of people or the guys in Africa that\nI'm working with right now doing elephant conservation and like, but you gotta show real. I mean, look, that's why Joe Rogan is important right now, that's why you're important right now is because it's not being filtered through this ridiculous system of\npolishing it and dumbing it down. - That's why Joe has been an inspiration. You don't need a crew\nof a bunch of people, you don't need a crew, period, all you need is one or two\nother people, and that's it. And in my case, you don't need anybody, I've been doing this. By requirement, I just\nneed to be by myself. There's a few other folks now\nthat are help with the editing and so on, but it's just,\nthey make life more awesome as opposed to a boss, like a creative director. Somebody told me actually,\nI was visiting LA, I think it was in LA. They were saying that, now\nfor all intimate scenes in Hollywood movies, there's\nan intimacy director. So when there's two people having sex, there's a third person\nthat ensures that on film, so it's not real, but\nthere's still intimacy, that there's a third person\nthat ensures that like everyone is comfortable and\nthe actors say that this always ruins the chemistry\nof the scene. (chuckles) It's a very Hollywood thing, I understand there's\ncreepy people and so on. - [Paul] Thanks, Harvey\nWeinstein, by the way. - It's usually I think\ncomes from the director pushing things too hard. If you just leave it to the actors, they know their boundaries, they can control their own boundaries. So the intimacy director is more for the director pushing things. - I understand the logic. Like, let's make sure that\nwe don't have anything happen here that shouldn't be\nhappening, I get it. But no, I think that authenticity\nis the greatest currency. And I think that in order\nfor me to tell the stories that I can tell, like, what\nchanged the game for me was, I wanna tell you the story. So, in 2019, the Amazon fires started popping\noff and we had just gone to film like a month earlier, we'd filmed like a small documentary. And they had been following\nme as if I was on a solo, which we did the best we\ncould, I lived on my own. But as we were driving, we passed a spot where the flames were 70-feet tall, the forest was being destroyed. And I went out there with my phone, which overheated in like\ntwo minutes and said, you can't use it. But for a second I was\nout there in the flames, picking up animals and throwing them off to try and just get them cooled off, I was trying to get snakes\noutta there, everything, the birds are flying,\nand I fucking lost it. I was red-eyed, I was\ncrying and I was going, \"This is happening every fucking day.\" I was screaming, and it's the\nfirst time that I'd done that 'cause I've seen the burning so many times and I just lost it that day. And I don't know what\nmade me pull out my phone 'cause usually in those intense moments I say forget the documentation,\nthis is real life. We got stuff to do and I'm\ndoing, I'm not documenting. And then a month later I'm\nhome and I'm in New York, and all of a sudden I see\nthese articles like, you know, the Amazon's burning worse this\nyear than it was last year, and blah, blah blah. And I was like this, you know, fuck it. And I threw it up on Instagram like eight o'clock at night. I'd never cursed on Instagram, I don't know, you know,\nwhy? I just never did. My phone was on a hundred percent and I put on top of the\nrefrigerator and I went to bed. And I woke up in the morning and my phone was on the floor on 2% and it was ringing off the\nhook, and it was like the news. And they were like, \"Are you the guy that posted that viral\nvideo about the Amazon?\" And I was like, what? And that was the start,\nthat's where it broke. And that's where we went from\nbarefoot in the Amazon to all of a sudden, you know, I was a talking head for three weeks and going around on all\nthese news stations, and all of a sudden I was like the spokesperson for the Amazon. JJ's calling me, and he was\nlike, \"Go, go, go, go, go.\" Like, \"Get us that support.\" And it was just, you know. So communicating with people and bringing them into that reality, and whether it's rhino\npoaching and elephant poaching, or the Amazon being destroyed, it's like, to me, it's like being able to take people into that is\nsomething that I would love to do. - Yeah, and you do it directly with authenticity on your Instagram. People should definitely\nfollow your Instagram, I think Rogan follows your Instagram too. - Well, the end of that story\nactually kind of involves him. 'Cause I went to all these news outlets and I was living in green\nrooms and traveling around and I was all strung out\nand I hadn't seen anybody I actually know in a few weeks, which was starting to get to me. And I finally got home and I\nwent to like a family party, and everyone was like,\n\"Dude, it's been crazy.\" And I was like, yep. And then I left, and my\ncousin Michael calls me and he's screaming, and\nI'm going, \"What, what?\" And he goes, \"Joe Rogan just shared it. Joe Rogan just shared it.\" - [Lex] Oh, nice. - And everyone was losing their\nshit and it was so amazing. And it was like, that's\nwhen it really took off. And what happened as a\nresult of all of this is that a Canadian entrepreneur who started Lightspeed reached out. And several months later,\nafter COVID, after that boom, I'd been in the game for\nmaybe 13 years or something, had no money, no savings,\nno job, no nothing. And after that great publicity\nthing, nothing happened. The waves came and\neverything got real exciting, everybody reached out and\nthey said, \"We care so much.\" Nothing happened, though. You know, we can run into battle, but if we don't have arrows in the quiver, what can we do? And I actually, I made a\nphone call to my friend Mosen right at the start of COVID, and I was going through\ndivorce and I was broke. And I said I'm gonna get a job. I said I give up. This is stupid. I said the ecotourism business is done, Junglekeepers is dried up. We're done. And then this guy Dax Dasilva\ncalled me on the phone and said, \"Listen, I'm\nin. What do we gotta do?\" And so if the analogy was me and JJ and a few other people trying\nto hold this boulder back from just destroying the rainforest, all of a sudden Dax comes in like a titan and just puts his arm out and\njust goes, \"I'm gonna help.\" And he gave us the funding to start actually\ndeveloping a ranger program, to start actually bringing loggers to be protectors of the forest, to be supporting smaller\nconservation things. And now we're protecting\n50,000 acres of rainforests, we're protecting entire streams\nand ecosystems that I love, and we're soon gonna double that. And it's like this whole thing, so yeah. The communication of\nthese things is crucial, and I actually think it's incredible that social media's played\nsuch a big role in it. - Well, I mean just 'cause I know Joe well and I love him so much, I definitely think you\nshould do his podcast but also just be friends\nwith him, I think you guys. He's one, you know, not to meme, but he's one with nature. And I'm much more with the, I'm one, while I do\nappreciate and love nature, I also love technology and robots and so on. So we're in that meme type of way, we're very, very different. - Well, either way, at some point make sure you tell the guy thank you because it definitely really\nhelped push us over that limit where, you know, if enough people see it, you get someone like Dax\nwho who says, \"I can help and I have the resources to help,\" and that changed our whole lives. - Changed everything. Back to the jungle. You had a bunch of\ninteractions with jaguars. How are you still alive? Like, what? - Man, dude. I'll tell you this,\nJags are not the danger, the falling trees are the danger. I'll tell you some elephant stories then you'll then you'll\nwonder why I'm still alive. So JJ started, and Santiago, his dad, started challenging me to do solos, go out alone into the wild style. You know, I'd have a hammock, a headlamp, three days worth of food,\nsome fish hooks, a machete, and that's it. And so, like one of the\nstories that happened early on was I was out there and it\nwas raining, and I was lost. This is how we test your jungle knowledge. Can you survive out there?\nDo you know how to find food? Have you listened to the\nthings that we taught you? And there was one night\nthat I was in a hammock and a jaguar came up, and I\nwas asleep when it happened. And she came up right next to my head and she was (imitates jaguar panting) and I could hear her smelling me. And then my first instinct\nwas to turn on my headlamp, and just the sound of my arm\nmoving against the material, and she just (imitates jaguar growling). Right here, I could feel her breath, and I just laid there in the dark. And that's one of those\nmoments where you go, you really learn a lot about yourself, because I wasn't scared, I felt like I understood\nthe intentions of the cat. If she was hunting, I'd already be dead, she was curious. And I was lost, and I didn't know if I was ever gonna get outta that jungle, but what she did was energize me 'cause it was an experience\nlike the giant anaconda where I said this is so wild that it's so almost cinematically outside the realm of what I\nthought my life could be like that it made me, like, wait, 'cause the previous day I\nwas lost, tired, confused, kind of devastated, tail between my legs. After that, I was like, \"Man, you've been waiting\nfor this your whole life. Go get it.\" And I woke up, and I was\nlike I am gonna navigate. Even though I've been in\nthis swamp for three days, I'm gonna find my way outta this swamp. And like, she just like\nbreathed fire into me, where it was like, if that's possible, if I could be six inches\naway from a jaguar's face. I got that energy from her. - So that you're able to\nstart to really hear and feel the jungle around you. That was a sign that you\nknow what you're doing. - [Paul] It really felt\nlike a sign, I really did. - How do you survive in a solo, solo hike through the jungle? What are the different components, what are the different dangers? So you said you had a\nhammock, you had some food. What kind of food, by the\nway, are we talking about? - Nuts, stuff that won't\ngo bad, because you can't, so you can't really start\na fire in the Amazon. Like, I'm a good, I mean\nI camp all over the place, I'm a wilderness guide. Starting a fire in the Amazon is futile, in fact a lot of survival manuals\nwill tell you don't do it, 'cause if you're really lost,\nit'll break your spirit. You're not gonna be able to do it. - [Lex] That's dark. - They're like, \"Don't even try it.\" But you can still get like hypothermia if you get wet and you\nlay out in the jungle, exposure can still get\nyou, so you want fire. In the beginning I used to\nbring like ramen noodles, which is, nutritionally, is irrelevant. And so I started bringing like nuts and then supplementing that with fish, which forced me to become\na very good fisherman. Now of course JJ knows that he can like, they can cut certain\nroots and they bash it up and they put it in the stream and the fish just float\nto the top, and they take. He's got all the cheat codes, whereas I'm sitting there with a hook. He'll go, \"Now, find bait,\" and I go bait. In the most competitive\necosystem on earth, good luck finding a worm. You can't do it. What does JJ do? He takes the machete, looks at his foot, cuts a slug of callous off of his heel 'cause he's got this thick rhino skin. Puts that on the hook,\ncatches a six-inch fish, chops it in half, puts\nit on a bigger bucket. And in 15 minutes he's got\na four-foot giant catfish that could feed a family of 16. And he's happy, I'm\nsitting there and I'm like, I'm gonna try and stick a\nbeetle on a fishing hook. - Do you have just a line and\na hook or is there a rod too? - Just a line and a hook\nand then you just chop a rod and tie it to the, you know, you just chop a little sapling. - So are you still able\nto start a fire or no? - I like for the food that I\nbring to not be fire-dependent. And so if I have some\nnuts, I can shove in a few, enough calories to get\nme through the night, and leave a fishing line out and there'll be something\nthere in the morning. But yes, I can start a fire but a lot of times what I'll\ndo is I'll bring a flask and not with alcohol but with diesel. And so you have a tuna can\nand you put the diesel. This is what the local guys do. Everything I do, you know, I'm sure there's gonna be\nsomeone listening to this and they're like, \"How could you do that?\" And it's like, this is what\nwe do down there, sorry. It's a tuna can, you pour a\nlittle bit of diesel in it. It burns slow, you light\nit and you put your sticks, you make a pyramid over that, and eventually that will\nburn through the moisture. And finally you'll get a\nvery reluctant little fire enough to burn, you know, to make yourself like a cup of tea or to pour that into the\nnoodles, something, something, or you just eat a fish raw. - How important is it to stay dry, is it basically impossible? - It's impossible to stay\ndry, you're wet all the time. You're wet all the time. - What does that mean? That means infections are more efficient? - Yeah. I don't know\nif you saw the picture in my book where I have the - [Lex] Yellow spots?\n- Yeah. - So yeah, there's a picture with your entire face consumed with yellow spots, it's basically, I guess, that's MRSA? - [Paul] Yeap. - Oh boy. So how did that happen? What was the infection like? And how crazy are you for\nletting that infection stay in you for a long period\nof time without treating it? Or you had no choice? - No, I did have a choice. I was 19 years old and I was\ntaking care of a giant anteater that was orphaned. And this is like my dream\nanimal and she was mine, and my job was to teach her the jungle. And so when I started like\nnoticing that I had an infection, I think I had dengue at the time too, I went back to town,\nprobably picked up MRSA in the hospital where I got tested. Came back into the jungle and\nthen got progressively sicker and sicker and weaker and weaker as I was two weeks, three\nweeks in the jungle. And it got to the point where my vision went black and white and I passed out one day. I don't know why, but at the\ntime I had shaved that day. And when I woke up the next\nmorning, I couldn't open my eyes because the pus had come outta my eyes and the pores in my face,\nall those little microcuts, and the pillow was stuck to my face. I was stuck upriver with\nno help at 19 years old. And also when you see that picture, you can imagine that I\nassumed that my life was over 'cause I didn't know what it was, or at the very least I\nfigured I'd be disfigured the rest of my life, I didn't think there was any\ngetting better from that. And so I remember sitting\nby the side of the river praying that a boat would come by, but it was the rainy season, there aren't gonna be any boats 'cause the river's psychotic. And so, it was a long time\nbefore I got back to town, and I didn't wanna leave the anteater, but it became like, I was\nlike, I realized I was dying. And then I finally got a\nboat with some loggers, a death boat, just loaded with, these guys had gone into the jungle and shot everything they\ncould and taken all the babies and they were gonna go sell them. And so it was like baby\nmonkeys and toucans and birds in cages and\npieces of crocodiles and anaconda skins and\njaguar skins rolled up. And it was just like,\nI was just laying there with all these dead animals in the boat with all the flies on my face. Got back to the hotel, called my mother, said, \"Please book me a flight\nout like today, like today.\" And then I sat on the plane. Somebody sat next to me on the\nplane, and I had a hood on. And I do remember that in the haze, at this point I was having\ntrouble staying conscious, but I do remember that\nshe like looked over trying to see what was\nsitting next to her, and then she got up and never came back. And when I got to immigration\nin New York, you know, the cop, he takes my passport and he goes, \"Yeah, so what were you doing in Peru?\" He is looking down, and he goes, yeah. And he holds up the passport, looks at the passport, looks at my face, he goes, \"Bo, buddy.\" He goes, \"What the fuck?\" And I said, \"No, that's why.\" I was like, \"I'm trying to get\nhome to go to the hospital.\" He stamps it and he goes, \"Go, go, go, go. God bless. God bless.\" He's like, \"Oh shit.\" And then they put me in\nthe room in the hospital with the hazmat suits, and\nthey didn't know what it was. And I spent like five\ndays on IV antibiotics with four different things\nrunning through my veins. The doctors were like,\n\"Don't let it go that close.\" They're like, \"You went\nreal close on that one.\" - Yeah, that's what that picture, I mean people should check out the book just to see the picture, because I imagine you just laying there unable to see, have a fever probably, so you're like half hallucinating. - [Paul] Yep, yep. - And there's no boat, there's no way out. - [Paul] There's no help coming. - Plus there's this creature\nwho you've become a parent of, that you love.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - Boy that's a dark place\nto be as a 19-year-old. I mean, most people will\nnever be in a place like that. Like, where did you find\nstrength in that place? - I don't know. I just remember\nwriting a goodbye letter to my parents 'cause I\nsaid if I die out here, it was really dark,\nlike, it was terrifying. It really felt like it was the end. And I was writing, if you\nfind me out here, I'm sorry, and all that type of stuff. And it was, you know. I don't know about strength,\nthere was no strength, it was just like move forward. And at some point it was like,\nif you'll take me downriver, take me downriver, you know. - You just got lucky with the\nloggers, with the death boat, that they found you?\n- Yeah. - Well, how did the\ninfection start by the way? - I don't know. I really don't know. I mean, we always have\nsome sort of little shit. But the thing is now JJ taught me that there's like three different trees that can cure infections, I didn't know this at the time, I didn't know the cheat codes. Now, if you have a small infection, you can use sangre de grado\nand it'll cure it right away. Like, let's say you have a botfly and it gets a little pus-y, there's a fly living in your skin, you put that on there, not\nonly will it kill the fly, but it'll heal the infection. Now if you have a worse\ninfection, you can go to ojé, which is ficus insipida\nand you can use that. And that will completely\nheal, that will murder, it's like crocodile blood,\nit will murder infections. So like, forget neosporin, that's a joke, these are heavy chemical compounds running through these trees, and they know all about 'em, and so whatever it is. So now at this point,\nthat's no longer an issue because we know how to handle it, which at that time if JJ had been there, I would've been fine. - Well, you learned the hard way. So these are open wounds and then there's creatures\nthat start living in them? Basically, what is it? - Well, that's separate, that's botflies. Yeah, there's a creature\nthat unfortunately, very, very, very unfortunately likes to make its home\ninside the flesh of mammals. And so the flies attach\ntheir eggs to mosquitoes, the mosquitoes go and seek\nout warm-blooded animals. The eggs, microscopic\neggs fall into your skin and then begin to grow. And sooner or later you feel a twitch, and it's a worm living inside of you that's like vertical down in you and it's eating you. And at first it's not a problem, but when they get to about\nas thick as that pen, it starts to hurt 'cause\nyou got a hole in you. And they have a little\nbreathing tube that comes up and they breathe and they go back in and then they eat and they\ncome back up to breathe. You have a friend living in you. - [Lex] You've had one of those? - I've had lots of those,\nit's tough to take 'em out. They have hooks. (both laughs) - How do you? Do you have to? (chuckles) Oh man, you gotta love the jungle. So how do you take it out?\n- You have to come. - [Lex] A hundred percent. - You gotta put an irritant. So like, a lot of times\nwhat we'll do down there is someone will take a\nmassive drag of a cigarette and then they'll power exhale and get some of the tar, which also shows you how much\ntar you get out of a cigarette and then with a knife you\nput that right over the hole. And then you slap some vaseline\nor something on top of that so they can't breathe. And eventually over the\ncourse of a few hours, they'll come up enough looking for air and then you gotta grab 'em with a tweezer and try not to rip him cause then you're gonna get an infection, and you gotta squeeze from the butt, it's a whole ceremony. When people have botflies, we're all like, oh, it's botfly time, let's go. And then like JJ will squeeze, he's got like pliers for thumbs. He can like take a piece of your neck and you think he's going\nto break your skin, he'll just squeeze until\nthis thing comes out. - And you don't wanna, this is an open wound right there. - Yeah, you don't wanna\nbathe for a day or two after until that closes 'cause\notherwise you're gonna have water sloshing around in\na little pocket of yours, it's kind of gross. - And that water might\nhave other organisms in it. - That water in your skin tends to, yeah. I mean the jungle water's\nclean, we drink it. Like, I drink the water\nfresh outta the stream. - [Lex] Oh, that's interesting. - Well, it's just a\ngiant filtration system, all those roots, the whole jungle's constantly purifying everything. - People might be thinking\nabout that with the jungle, there's insects probably\nall over you all the time. - It's not as bad as you think. Like, I've been to Finland,\nLapland in the summer and the mosquitoes are\nhorrendous, like devastating. The Amazon in our area, if you're sitting in a\nhammock reading a book out, our research stations don't\nhave walls or anything, you're good for about one\nmosquito every half hour, which really is not a lot, I mean, it's worse than New Jersey. Like, it's really not that bad. - Tell me a little more about the little baby anteater, Lulu, who you've rescued and\nhad to sadly leave behind. - Yeah, I just was always\nfascinated with giant anteaters. They're this, you know,\nGerman shepherd sized thing with Wolverine claws and\nthese giant Popeye forearms. And they excavate ant and termite mounds, and they have this long tongue. And their baby's ride on their back for the first six months of their lives. And so they actually have this incredibly intimate relationship with their young, and it just so happened that this animal that I was wildly fascinated with, there was an orphan on the river, and JJ was like, \"You love these things?\" And I was like yeah. So he went and he was like,\n\"Hey, my friend, you should,\" he got me the baby. And we were, like, we're gonna rewild her. And so I spent like weeks\nand weeks and weeks just like with this thing on my back,\ncrawling through the jungle, teaching her to find\nants, giving her milk, falling asleep with her on my chest. And their tongue is like\n11 inches long at that age, and so when she wanted me to wake up, she'd fired up my nose and\nit would come out my mouth. And then if I tried to\nget her off me quick, she'd stick the claws in. And you know, on all my\nclothes I have old, you know, now they're like museum\npieces with rips in them from Lulu's claws. - She was able to also communicate emotion and feeling and all that. - She needed it, she needed it. So if this animal didn't\nhave the physical touch, if I didn't hold her all day long, she'd throw tantrums,\nshe'd go shred something, she'd go pull down the curtain,\nshe'd go ruin the woods. She'd start literally\nhaving traumatic response to not having intimacy,\nwhich was shocking, 'cause again, on the scale of\na cockroach to an elephant, you go, I didn't know that giant anteaters had such intense emotions, like, but she did. And also taking care of her forced me to explore the jungle from\nthe perspective of an animal. So I got to like be an animal. And so there's only a few\ntimes in your life, in my life where I've gotten to do\nthat, one was with her, another time was living\nwith the herd of elephants where I had to walk with them through the forest and like see how they interacted completely natural. And it's different, it's very different. And you realize like, just\nlike a person's public persona when they're out on the\nstreet in Manhattan, is gonna be very different than when you're on the couch\nwith them on a Tuesday night. And with wild animals\nit's very much like that. You know, like if you\nsee a bobcat on a trail, it's gonna look at you and\nglare at you and then go off. And it's like, yeah, but what's\nit like when it's in the den and it's playing with its cubs? - Yeah. So that when it's looking at you, that's like the Instagram\npost it's making. - [Paul] He's doing dark face. - Besides Amazon, you spend\na lot of time in India. Can you tell me what you learned hanging out with the herd of elephants? What do people not\nunderstand about elephants that's beautiful to you,\nthat's interesting to you? - First of all, I think the elephants should have government representation as like a subset of\nsociety, like, actually. - [Lex] They have intelligence? - They are so intelligent. And when you look at an elephant, so there's this question\nthat keeps coming up of, are we smart enough to\nknow how smart animals are? Can we interpret the\nintelligence that we're seeing? I lived with a semi-wild\nherd of elephants in India for a while, and some of the things that I saw changed how I view reality,\nto be honest with you. 'Cause you know, you watch a\nmatriarch of an elephant herd walk up to someone that\nnone of us knew was pregnant and her trunk goes to her stomach, and then she calls all\nthe other ones over. And they're interested\nin this little human that they know that\nthere's something in there. And they're all conversing\nabout it and you go, whoa. Or that every morning we'd wake up and the elephants didn't\nwant the stream water, they didn't want the lake\nwater, they didn't want puddles, they wanted the water from our well. We had like a stone well,\nyou know, like a traditional. And every morning we had to run outta bed 'cause all the elephants were gonna come and they were gonna rip the bucket off and destroy everything, but they wanted that\nnice cold, clean water. And so it was like caring\nfor elephants that were wild, that were sometimes\ngetting shot at by farmers, 'cause if they went to\ntry and rob some bananas. So these are sort of\nlike delinquent elephants that were half wild and the forest department\nwas thinking about, you know, getting rid of them,\nwhich, whatever that meant. I made really good friends\nwith this one elephant, his name was Dharma. And Dharma had the... It's hard to write the\nbook I'm writing right now because none of it sounds real. He grew up around people\nbecause he was a tuskless male, so he couldn't hang out with the females 'cause he was a grownup male, and he couldn't hang out\nwith the males, the bulls, because he couldn't defend himself when they roughhoused and everything. So, Dharma would be like\nwandering around the forest not knowing who to hang out with. And so like, there was one\nnight there was a tiger calling and we just heard (imitates tiger roaring) you could hear it echoing over the hills. And what does Dharma do? 2:00 AM, we hear Dharma show up. And same thing, he starts\nthrowing a tantrum, he starts pulling shit over, takes a chair, throws it. We had bananas in the truck. Dharma walks up to the\ntruck, it's like a jeep. He walks up to the jeep, smells it, he looks at me and he's like,\n\"Are you gonna get outta bed?\" I'm like, no, I'm not gonna get outta bed. I was like, \"Dharma, you're\na grown-ass elephant.\" The tiger does his thing again and he's like, \"I need\nbananas to feel better.\" Pushes the truck up on two wheels, looks at me, is this\nhow you want it to be? And so I'm up, I'm up. And I go and I'm like,\n\"Please, please, please.\" Dharma, I'm rubbing his face. And he's like, he puts it down. He's like, all right, well then hit me. I didn't do it, so he lifts it up again. And so in the end, there was no way for me to outsmart the elephant, he wins. There was nothing I could do. And so a lot of my job was\ntaking him out into the forest and you know, spending a\nlittle bit of time with him. I have this beautiful, one time I set up the tripod and I went, and I was just journaling. And he would come and he\nwould just play with my hair and he'd be like, \"Hey, what's up? He wanted someone to interact\nwith on an emotional level. And when you think about elephants in terms of the fact that, you know, people go, oh, they use medication to induce labor. It's like, yeah, that's\nnot that surprising. They hold the bones of the dead, it's like, yeah, they have the best smell of pretty much any animal, that's also not surprising. They probably know exactly\nwho that was, that bone. But they can navigate to waterholes and communicate in ways that\nwe cannot really figure out. And so when you hear about people measuring elephant intelligence, you'll hear about scientists being like, \"Oh well, we gave it a\nbucket with a hole in it, and then it had like a\nkey and there was a rope.\" And you're like, bro,\nthis is all human stuff. Can you go walking with them\nfor three weeks in the wild and watch how they deal with the problems that they encounter in the forest? And so elephants have become, especially recently with the work that I've been doing in Africa with VETPAW I've just become so\nfascinated with elephants. The African elephant population\nright now is down at 2% of what it was a few hundred years ago, we're really putting them\non the brink of, you know. There's some elephants that\nare being born tuskless because poaching has taken down the great tuskers to the point where now it's actually beneficial for some elephants to not have tusks 'cause then they won't have humans. That's like we've created\ndeformed elephants. And so now I'm gotten very concerned with issues of elephants. - And tusks are fundamental to the interaction between elephants? - Absolutely. I mean, when\nmales compete with each other, but also elephants use their tusks. They'll break a branch\nand they'll be like, \"This is a good branch, I'm\ngonna eat the hell out of this\" and they'll like hang it on their tusk, and they'll grab a bunch of other stuff, they'll like hold it. You know, ripping a tree\nup out of the ground. I just watched it. Two weeks ago, I was watching an elephant, he got down on his knees and\nstuck his tusk into the ground and like leveraged up. He, like, archimedes this\nroot out of the ground and then was like, that's a sweet root. And then when he left, I went, and I tasted the root and\nit was like sweet ginger. And I was like, I have\nno idea what this is but he knew it was good. - Do they use tusk for sexual selection? Like, to impress the ladies, or no? - It's certainly involved\nin who has mating rights. - [Lex] Oh, who wins in the contest. - I mean, if you got the big tusks, and there are elephants out there, like the mammoth, big tuskers that have tusks down to\nthe ground, like, huge. And when you see them,\nit's like seeing something unique on earth, unique in history 'cause we're at a point\nwhere we might lose those. There are only a few of them left and then they're so prized by hunters. - Yeah, it's interesting 'cause I forget what the actual conclusion on that is 'cause there's some studies of the use of the value of beauty in evolution, like birds and peacocks and so on, that there's no actual value to it but it plays a role in sexual selection. Meaning value, like, it's much easier to\nunderstand competition, like a tusk helps you\ndefeat the competitor. - [Paul] It's a tool. - But I bet you there's\na component to the tusk where the ladies go,\n\"Goddamn, that's a nice tusk.\" Like, there's a visual\nbeautiful component, maybe not, I don't know. - But what if beauty though, as we're defining it though, is symmetry and the absence of\nyellow spots on your face and healthy-looking hair. And so like, I think to us beauty is sexually-appealing traits\nthat look good to mate with. - So that 19-year-old with MRSA everybody in the world would\nswipe left on that. (chuckles) The least sexually desirable\nobject in the universe. Okay. Speaking of elephant intelligence and something I think\nand work quite a bit on, as with artificial intelligence, is what the philosophical\nquestion that comes up is what is intelligence? What is intelligent? Humans, homo sapiens are often thought to be highly intelligent, that's the reason they stand out. In your understanding of different species like the elephant, what stands\nout to you about humans? Or are they just another animal with different kinds of intelligence? - Well, we're certainly unique because we have altered the entire planet. You know, the term the Anthropocene, I mean, it's like we've literally created a geological layer of us, whereas other animals don't. And going back to elephants, it's like they also\nengineer their environment. If you're in a forest, like if you drop me in a forest on earth, I could tell you in two seconds\nif there's elephants there because there's twisted\nbranches and excavated earth, they're constantly gardening. But I mean, look at us. I mean we're clearly unique in nature, which makes me not understand\nthe anti-human sentiment that so much of\nenvironmentalism has about like we're bad, we're damned,\nwe ruin everything. And it's like, I've seen the worst, I've seen the burning\nAmazon and I'm still like, I love being able to share ideas with you and travel to places and FaceTime my family\nwhen I'm not around them. And it's like, I celebrate a\nlot of what makes us human. It's almost like reality\nis this crazy video game, and it's like if we could just\nfigure out the right keys, we can pretty much do\nanything we can think of. I mean, poetry, art, I mean, you know. I'm the biggest animal lover in the world, but we are different, we really are. - Yeah, the ability to\npuzzle solve, create tools. What do you think is the coolest invention humans have come up with? Is it fire? What's the most impactful? - I feel like fire is kind\nof a gimmy. I feel like the-- - [Lex] They didn't really\ninvent it, they probably-- - Like, the wheel, flying. I mean, flying. Think if you could go back in time to someone that never flew. You know, a saltan, an Egyptian king, George Washington, you know, and be like, you can fly. I mean, just on my way here, and I fly way too much, but I was looking out the\nwindow at the clouds and going, \"This is unbelievably\nspectacular. It's just stunning.\" You know, as a kid, you\nlook at a cloudy day and you go, \"The world\nis like this today.\" And then you get in a plane\nand you fly above the clouds and it's sunny up there and you go, oh. It changes your perspective, it's like when people go to\nthe moon and they come back and they tell you the pale\nblue dot, you know, just. I'd say flying, I think\nthe ability to fly. I mean the fact that I could\nget on a plane and be in India in 20-22 hours is shocking. - In terms of its usefulness, I would argue that's not in the top five, but in terms of its ability to inspire. There's somebody I forgot\nwho told me this idea that there's something about the\natmosphere, earth's atmosphere that allows you to look\nup and see the stars. Like if we didn't have that, human civilization\nwould not have happened, meaning like, being able to look up and see something out there. Like, something that allows you to look up versus just look down, looking at your local environment, be able to like wander and see, holy shit, there's a big world out there,\nand I don't know anything. If you're able to look up and see that, that kind of humility combined with the ability\nto dream about exploring, maybe it just inspires the exploration. It's kind of an interesting thought given how inspiring, for example, the extra upgraded super\ncool version of flying, which is flying to other planets. There's going to be,\nhopefully it's possible, this century, a child born, no, not this century, maybe this century, a child born on another planet that looks up and looks back at earth, has to be educated by his\nor her parents that like, there's another place. There's another place-\n- [Paul] That creeps me out. - where life is way easier. - [Paul] Oh God, it's so easy. There's water everywhere. - Yeah, exactly. People\ncomplain about earth, man, earth is really, really nice. - [Paul] It's really, really good here. - Water everywhere, anything. - Oh man, I wouldn't even leave. Given, like right now, if somebody said, like,\nyou could go to the moon, I'd be like, no, I'm good. If I died in space, I'd be so pissed. I love it here. - Yeah, but you're still, there's a longing to explore for you. - There's a longing to explore but I really think I'm such a... Like, my longing to explore is like river streams, oceans, jungles. - [Lex] Life.\n- Yeah. I would watch the hell\nout of the live stream of Elon touching down on Mars. Like, I'd be like, this is incredible, it's amazing that I get\nto be around to see this. I'm staying where, I'll be right here. - Yeah, but it's good that\nthe human spirit pushes us. - [Paul] Oh, it's amazing. - That it was possible. And it does that for you. Just a out-there question. What's the most dangerous\nanimal in the Amazon, would you say? Mammal, let's go with mammal. - [Paul] Dangerous mammal. - Like, dangerous in terms of you walking around doing the solo hike. - I'm gonna disappoint\neverybody with this, but it's humans. It's nothing, there's no... If I'm out in the Amazon, there's nothing that's going to attack me. And in India you might have an old leopard or a tiger that's missing a\ntooth that decides you're prey, or you might have an angry\nelephant that's in must that just decides to flatten you. In the Amazon, you're not, jaguars won't even let you see them, and there's really nothing else. One of my friends, a brilliant scientist friend of mine, Pat, got attacked by a rabid ocelot once, but that's like a diesel\nhouse cat just having a fit, you know, it wasn't the\nworst thing in the world. - Just the assholes of the animal kingdom. In terms of humans, you've said that the tribes, some of them uncontacted can be exceptionally dangerous. What's your experience with\nthem? What should people learn? Because it's such a\nfascinating part of life here on earth that there's\ntribes that don't have much or any contact with the quote, unquote \"civilized world.\" - Most of the people that\nI meet don't actually really understand how\nisolated these people are or how weird it is that we're sitting here and that we have iPhones and\nairplanes and all this stuff and these people are\nliving naked in the forest at this moment. The thing though, you know, and I also was recently somebody showed me all this\nlike paleolithic tribes, and it's like, no, no. Just by default they're\nmodern tribes living now, they just happen to be\nliving out in the jungle. And there's a huge debate about\ndo we try and contact them and bring them in? And there's two camps of people\non this who they say that it was the trauma of the\nrubber boom that sent them out that far into the forest\nand made them terrified of the outside world. And so that's also what\nmade them so hyper violent. One of the guys we work\nwith on our team, Victor, was in, I think it was 2004, he's coming downriver and he\nhad a load of mahogany wood. And he's piloting this boat. And he sent two people, husband and wife, ahead to go start cooking\nbreakfast on the beach so they could put the little\nkitchenette thing down and put the propane. He sent them ahead. He's going nice and slow with the barge coming down the river. They go ahead, reach\nthe beach, they get out, he starts cutting some cane\nto start making a fire. Tribe comes out, no warning,\nthey just start screaming, they start shooting arrows. The man instantly gets\nan arrow through the leg and it pins his leg so he can't run. He tells his wife, go, save yourself, and she does. She jumps in the water, there's arrows falling around her too. And as she's floating down the river, she looks back and the last\nthing she sees is these guys getting to her husband and\nbeginning to rip him apart. As Victor comes down the river, this is a guy we work with every day, he comes down the river\nand sees his friend disemboweled, opened up, dissected, his parts are all over the\nbeach, the beach is red. And they only found out what\nhappened because they found her later on holding onto a stick in the river and they were like, what happened? And she was like, \"They just attacked.\" They don't want people on their land. On the sort of the underground\nWhatsApp chain of the Amazon, a few, in August, like this was not internationally known, some loggers went up and\ntried to steal a few trees from where the tribes were. And then everybody sent the pictures of what the loggers looked\nlike after a few days because the tribes\nporcupined them with arrows. They were laying there on the ground with just arrows sticking\noutta their bodies. And then eventually the\nauthorities came out and looked, and there was just these white body, I'll show you the pictures later, there's just these white puffy bodies with like the skulls sticking out. And it was like, you don't\nmess with these tribes. - I wonder what's the mythology around, that they construct around\nwho these outsiders are? Are they gods, are they demons? Are they humans? Who are they? Who are we to them? - Well, you gotta go\nback to the rubber boom. The rubber barons went down there and at the start of the\nindustrial revolution, the only way to get rubber\nwas to mine it from the trees that are out in the forest. And so the only way to do that, 'cause you can't make a rubber\nplantation in the jungle. The rubber, when it's in plantation form, when it's a monoculture, it gets this leaf blight and it all dies. Henry Ford tried, it didn't work. And so what they did was\nthey sent these people down who just whipped, burned, enslaved, raped and pillaged the people. It's one of the worst\nperiods in human suffering that I've ever read about. One missionary said they\nwere killing the locals the way you or I would kill a mosquito. They just went nuts. And so they sent them out\nand they would come back with rubber and this would go to fuel the industrial revolution for\nhoses and gaskets and tires and all this stuff that\nsuddenly we needed. And it was during that\ntime that these, you know, gangs of foreigners\nwould go into the jungle to enslave the natives that these uncontacted tribes\nwent back into the jungle and said, \"Not us.\" And they have six-foot\nbows and seven-foot arrows with bamboo tips. They make the bamboo\ntips into razor blades. And so when those things fly, actually one of my rangers,\none of the Junglekeepers team was present when the tribes\nhad come out onto the river, and he tried to help them\n'cause they're nomadic and they live out there. And so there's an element of like brother, you know, they're trying to be like, you don't need to be like this, like, we're friendly. So they sent a canoe across\nthe river with bananas. And so he's up to his waist in the river and the tribes are right across the river. And they shot, and he sees the arrow coming right at his head. And as he moved to the side,\nit hit him at the temple and sliced them back towards the ear, opening him to the skull, he's fine. But let me tell you something, when he goes and gets a crew cut, it's the most badass scar\nyou've ever seen, man. And so he always keeps it\nreal short on that side. But even if you try to help them they're not necessarily friendly. - [Lex] That's a tough lesson. - Yeah. - [Lex] I suppose they have a point. - They have a point and\nprotecting them is a default of, you know, now that we're\nprotecting all this ecosystems and all these other\nindigenous communities, it's like we all sort of\nlive with this knowledge that they're the hermanos, the brothers are out there, and that's the way they want to keep it. And so we just have to\nbe respectful of like, you don't camp on certain beaches at certain times of the year because we know that they might be there. You really have to be careful about that. - Have you yourself interacted with any? - My interaction with them came on a solo where I pushed it a little bit too far. I was planning to do a three week, this was like the big one. I got dropped off by poachers up a river and I went past the point where\nthey were like names there. I said what tributary are we on? And they were like, \"Tributary.\" And I was like okay. And I said, \"Leave me here.\" And I remember the guy being like, \"Are you committing suicide?\" And he didn't understand that. I was like, \"No, I have a\nbackpack and I have food. I'm gonna like take videos\nand I have a tripod.\" And I was, like, we're cool here. They looked at me, like,\nthey were like, \"Goodbye.\" And I was like, \"All right.\" And I like went up this river. And again, you learn these\nthings like, you know, it was only when I'd been alone for a week that you realize you're, there's that saying, like, you're born alone and you die alone. It's like, no, you're not. You're born into a room\nfull of people usually, at the very least your\nmother's there for everybody. So you've been around people probably if you're a normal person\nevery single day of your life, you've seen dozens if\nnot hundreds of people. And all of a sudden you realize what a social creature we are, because on day six, it gets weird. For me, it got weird, I know there's people\nthat can do it longer. - So what does that mean? Like, longing for contact? Like, lonely? - Longing for contact,\nthe distortion of reality in the sense that like, you know, you wake up\nand there's no one there and you start to, you know, you're going up a river. I kept looking back downriver and almost thinking of\nmy life as something, it was almost like I had already died and I had gone to somewhere else, and I was looking back\non that life as like something that I had experienced. And then there came this\npanic of, what if it's gone? Or like, what if World War III broke out and I just don't know about it? My family in New York is\nvaporizing. Something. - So actually, your ability to comprehend and interpret reality kind\nof requires other people. It's not just that you're lonely, you need that contact to\nactually just perceive the world, makes sense of it, all of that, so you start basically hallucinating in a certain kind of way. - I started feeling very uncomfortable. And it doesn't help also that, like, Santiago told me these\nstories where he's like, \"If you hear capuchins\nsounding not quite monkeys, if you hear capuchin monkeys sounding not quite like capuchin,\" he goes, \"It's the tribe and\nthey're coming to get ya.\" And then, so the guy\nwho was shot, Ignacio, they showed me videos where\nwe saw them on the beach and they're communicating in monkey calls. They're using it as code so\nthat we don't understand them, even though we don't speak their language. But they're using animal calls. And so every night you go\nto sleep and then you go, did that tinamou sound off? And you're like, \"Shit.\" You know, and it's really\nhard to fall asleep. And then one night, I messed up, and I left a fish. I cleaned this fish, I\nate like this huge fish, I just ate it to my face. You're putting out marathon\nlevels of energy every day, like, you know, Goggins would love solos. He'd be like, \"This is awesome.\" - Do you eat fish raw? - This one I actually cooked it. But the skeleton was laying there right outside my tent, stupid. And in the middle of the night I wake up, I just could tell there\nwas something there, you know, and then you\nalmost don't wanna look. It's like when you're a\nkid at the basement door and you're like, is there a ghost? I unzipped the tent, and I open it up, and\nthere's like 27 black caiman outside of my tent all\nlooking at me like this. And some of their heads are\nthis big and they're like, \"This fish there, can we have it?\" And I'm like, \"Holy shit.\" I kind of like had to scooch the tent back and move back and let\nthem have their fish, and there was a host of\ncrocodiles outside of my tent. But no, so then there was--\n- Wait, how many? - Like 27, maybe? There was a lot. Big ones, small ones, medium-sized one, every type were all there. Their eyes glow in the night. You know, you shine a light at animals and they have a tapetum lucidum and so their eye shine comes back at you. If you shine a headlamp\nat a jaguar or a frog, almost every animal has a tapetum. - There's a croc, there's\na whole lot of them. Can we go back to the\npart of the conversation where you said the\njungle is not dangerous, the humans are the most dangerous? - Well, did they eat me? No. - [Lex] Why didn't they eat you? - They wanted the fish. - Is there some way of\nyou interacting with them that shows that you're not source of harm? - I don't believe so. I'm sure there's someone out there that thinks they can talk to crocs, but. - Because there's a story\nof you grabbing a croc by the tail. What did you learn from that? - [Paul] Learned to not\nalways listen to JJ. - So JJ was testing you. - Yeah, to see how stupid it was. - [Lex] How do you hold\nthe crocodile exactly? - You have to get 'em by the head, like an anaconda, like this. - So you're one of the world experts of grabbing creature by the head? - I wouldn't say world expert,\nbut I've done a lot of it. I also have, you see how there's\nlike kind of a ball there? That's where a crocodile\ntooth went in that side and came out that side. That was a really good chomp. And the watch I was wearing\nat the time saved me, 'cause that (imitates\ncrocodile snapping) like that. - [Lex] Just real fast, just chomp. - Just whack. Like, somebody\ntook a sledgehammer, you put your hand on the table and it just went (imitates\nsledgehammer slamming). Really hurt, shouldn't\nhave been doing that. - [Lex] How did that come up? - Because I caught a\ncroc that was too big. So usually when we catch\nlittle caiman in the streams and we measure them to\nmonitor the populations, you get it by the neck and then I tuck the tail\nunder my arm and I hold it. And you're talking about a little, you know, four-foot croc, nothing. This one, I dove into a swamp, and I caught like a\nsix-foot spectacle caiman. And her head was big, and\nI had her by the neck. And I realized I couldn't\nget her tail under my arm 'cause her tail was all the way back there and she started thrashing. And it was like probably croc\nnumber 375 that I'd caught, and I just got a little\ncocky and I said, \"Haha.\" You know, I just like\ngrabbed her by a leg, I was like I got this. And she just came back and tagged me. And I went, okay, gonna\ngo back to being safe. - Just to linger on it. Is it one of the bigger\npredators in the Amazon? Are they going extinct? Black caimans? - Black caimans were, I believe, they were critically\nendangered for a while because for a while the fashion\nindustry loved their skin, it's soft and it's black. They're bouncing back a little bit now. Like, most animals, if\nyou leave them alone, they'll be fine. I mean, crocs have been through, you know, how many millions and millions\nof years on earth before us. I mean, that's even\nthe joke with the joke, but that's the grim reality\nof tiger conservation. There was 100,000 tigers in 1900, now there's 4,000 tigers left on earth. It's not rocket science. All you have to do is\nnot bulldoze their forest and allow there to be some\ndeer and tigers will be fine. That's it. It's so simple. And that's like sometimes\nwhere I feel like I have the dumbest job in the world. I'm like, guys, please\nstop killing the things that keep us alive. The Amazon regulates our global\nclimate, produces medicine, it's home to indigenous\npeople, it's beautiful. Rainforests only cover 3%\nof the planet's land mass, like, it's not that much to ask. - If you leave their home untouched, they'll figure out how\nto have sex and multiply. Except for pandas, apparently, 'cause pandas you have to convince. - Yeah. Humpbacks, they went down to, they went from 130,000 down\nto, I think, about 8,000 at wailing times. And then when we banned\nwailing, since that time, I think we're back up to\nover 100,000 humpback whales. They've bounced back,\nit's a success story. We're not gonna lose 'em. - Okay. So you're on a solo, with the crocs looking at you. - See, this is why you're good at this. I would've lost, we would've\nbeen on tangent forever. - [Lex] That's pretty epic with the fish, that was your mistake. - That was my mistake, the fish. - I don't understand\nhow you're still alive. (Paul laughs) It's really inspiring. - When you come, I'm gonna show you. You told me you're coming earlier. - Hundred percent coming,\nyeah, but you know. (both chuckles) If there's any place, I mean, sort of a grim joke, but if there's any way to\ndie, that's a good one, if I'm being honest. - [Paul] It's a cool one. - It's a pretty cool one. - [Paul] You'll become part of the- - Part, yeah. I'm not even joking, there's a oneness to the whole thing. All the stories, just reading your work, looking at your work, it seems like you are a part\nof this machine that is nature, this incredible machine. Like, we all die and we're\nall part of this big thing that humans do have the capability to also construct narratives\nand stories and myths and tell 'em to each other and share them with each other and have more sophisticated ways therefore to communicate\nlove to each other, but animals do as well. They communicate love, maybe more simply, maybe more honestly. Anyway, so you were with\nthe crocs and the fish. - Yeah. So I messed up,\nI left the fish out, crocs showed up outside my tent. But in the end it was fine. I backed off, they had\ntheir way with the fish, and then they all started\nbiting each other, it was fun to watch. - Is that a general, sorry to interrupt, is that a general rule,\nyou want to not leave food? - Yeah, just like if you're\ncamping in the northeast, you don't leave like, you do\na bear bag or a bear canister, you don't want to invite the wild animals. I really did mess up, I kind of was just like,\nyou know, whatever, I do this every now and then,\nI get a little too cavalier, and the ocean has almost taken\nme down for that a few times. But yeah, so the crocs, and then you keep going for a few days. And my plan was to get to a point where I reached the end of the tributary. And this had a very... You know, again, for me,\nthis is like a pilgrimage. This is like me going into the heart of the very center and soul\nand essence of everything that I am fascinated with, like, as close to God as you can get because you're leaving\nevery type of security, every human relationship, you're also pushing all your chips in. Every step I took further upriver, it got weirder and\nweirder and more intense. And every day and every moment it changed. I brought pictures, and at the time, there's no\nway to keep a phone charged, I didn't have like a\npower bank or anything. You know, I brought pictures from home. I brought a National Geographic magazine, something just to, you know. And there came a day right\nwhen I was getting to the end, like to the point where the\nriver was so shallow that it was just a trickle. And I was walking on the rocks and the Andes mountains\nwere in front of me. And I was like reaching the place and the music was swelling, and then all of a sudden I saw\nsmoke around the next bend. Like, my spine is reacting\nright now as I talk about it because I knew what I was gonna see 'cause I knew that it was\nimpossible for loggers to be out there, there's no motor that could take you, the boat would've run a ground miles ago. And so, I went. This is the other idiot thing. It's like, just turn around. Just do it. I'm that kid though when you\nsee like a wet paint sign, like I walk by and I touch the wall. And so I went around the bend and I see a few naked people on the beach and they see me. And we're like a good distance apart, they're on the other side of the river. But, you know, arrow in hand, bow in hand. The intention of pose,\nthey're looking at me, they're clearly conversing. And that moment lasted for a long moment where I said, \"This is\nthe part of the story where they are going to rip me apart, dissect me to see what I eat.\" I mean, every other story in\nthe region that we've heard, that's the ending of it. If you're alone with these people, it's not gonna go well, and I have nothing to defend myself with. And I turned and I ran\nfor like three hours and I got in the river\nand I swam for a while. And all my food got\nwet, I mean everything. - [Lex] Just ran for dear life. - Just ran for dear life. And my get out plan, the thing after I crossed the mountains and came down into the next\ntributary was I had a pack raft. It's a tiny little inflatable raft, good enough to handle rapids. And I inflated the pack\nraft once the river was like six inches deep, I inflated the pack raft and I went. And I went for the rest of\nthat day into the night, I went into the point\nthat my headlamp died and I was just floating\nin a raft down the Amazon and hitting into things. And then I was like, okay,\nI'm gonna pop this raft. So I got out of the raft, set up my tent, and I was like, I need some\nsleep, I was freaking out. I hadn't had food in\nhours and hours and hours. As soon as I fell asleep, my asshole brain comes\nup with the dream of that I hear voices, they're\nright outside the tent. Sleeping was worse than being awake. So I woke up, got back in the tent, and then at one point it was really cool 'cause one of the same\nblack caiman that had come for the fish as I'm going downriver, he came right up next to me\nand the two of us were going and he was just like motoring downriver, this giant, like, 16-foot crocodile. He just came up to me and\nlooked at me as I was going. And it was funny 'cause\nI wasn't scared of him, I was scared of them. And yeah, it took me like\na week to get back to town. And again, the things you\nlearn in these moments, the appreciation for your parents, what a hug feels like. When you are faced with\npretty much certainty that you're not gonna\nget those things again, whether it's from MRSA or uncontacted tribes or, you know. I find that it brings you this\nnew joy for life where you-- - [Lex] Just being that close to death. - Yeah. You go, \"My god,\nthis is all a miracle.\" - It's sad because they're\nhuman just like you. Actually, how different are they? Like, if you were forced to\ninteract for a week together, where they can't, they're\nnot allowed to kill you. - [Paul] Not allowed to kill me. - How fundamentally different\nare they, do you think? - I don't think they're different, I think they're like any\nother Amazonian natives. They're tall, they seem\nto have tall genetics. And there's places, you know, again, there's what is known and then there's what we know down there. Like, there's one community where, I don't know whether it\nwas like a bad rainstorm or something, but some kid\nfrom the uncontacted tribes did end up in a village. And so he learned Spanish, or he learned whatever dialect\nthey speak in that village. And so he's told us a little bit about what life was like with them. But like, they're just\npeople. They're just people. They have their own culture, they know about medicines\nthat we don't know about. They definitely have hunting practices that we don't understand. They can hit a spider\nmonkey out of 160-foot tree with a bamboo arrow, we can't do that. I mean, they are incredible hunters. And also like, living naked in the jungle with the botflies and the mosquitoes, I don't know how they do it. Like, sometimes at night, and again, we don't have night vision, whereas almost every other animal does. And sometimes we'll be sitting, you know, at the research station at night and we'll be just drinking\nand like looking out, you know, we'll scare each other. We'll go, you realize if they\nwere out there right now, they could be looking at us. And it's like, the truth is is that when it's dark out there, they can't see, it's not easy to start a fire with matches in a lighter and gasoline, they do it with friction. They have some beads on survival that we could really learn from. Not to mention that then you\nhave people that believe that they're actually the guardians of the extinct giant ground sloth, and what they're doing is living out there because they're protecting\na secret population of previously extinct megafauna. But there's all kinds, I mean, it's like you go into\nthe crypto world so quick I've heard so many people be like. - But then again, you have to be humble at how little we know about that world, about the world of life. Like, you said, there's so\nmuch of life in the Amazon that we don't, creatures with no names. - Tons of 'em. We could go out on a night walk right now and I could show you\nsomething that, you know. I've done it. You pick\nup a bug and you go, \"That doesn't look right. That's not right, he's got three heads.\" You know, and then you send\nit to the greatest expert on that genus of insects. And they go, \"Look, I got no idea,\" and you're talking to a world expert. And it's like, that's it. And 50% of the life is up in the canopy. And so like, we started\nclimbing the trees, like rock climbing, like\nwhat Alex Honnold does. I'll climb up 50 feet and\nthen I'll put a safety, like I'm basically trad climbing. And then I'll climb up another 50 feet and I'll have JJ belaying me from below. And then he'll be like,\n\"Ooh, look a snake.\" I'm like, \"JJ, pay attention.\" Like, to get up there and the branches are\nas thick as this table so you can walk around freely. It's like total like \"Avatar\" when they're in the floating islands. You can go run around\nif that's what you want. Bromeliads, orchids, cactuses, because up there it's against the sun so it's a different environment up there. - [Lex] Oh wow, interesting. - And then you start seeing\nlizards and snakes and birds and things that aren't down on the ground. And so how many scientists\nhave actually gotten to really spend time up there\nand really inventory the life? And that's why when you hear about, and it's like a taxonomical discussion of how many species they're on earth. They're like between 10 and 30 million. And it's like, well that's a big swing. - What about stuff on the ground? So you mentioned some insects. What about bullet ants? So it's supposed to be the\nmost painful bite in the world. You've been bitten by one? - Seven or eight times, yeah. - Cool. What does it feel like? - Okay, so the first time\nthat we ever did bullet ants, JJ said, you know, okay, this is what we're gonna do. He goes, you know, it's\nbullet ant roulette. We're gonna get a bullet ant and you're gonna get like chopsticks. You like, pick up this\nbullet ant, and they're big, they're big and they're tough. He goes, \"We're gonna\nput our forearms together and we're gonna drop the bullet ant and clamp our forearms\ntogether and just rub. And whoever it takes, it takes.\" Of course, JJ did not get stung and I did. And it hurts every bit as\nmuch as they say it hurts, it really let me have it. And then I was like hitting\nmy arm against the table to try and kill it or get it off. But it was holding on and just like really injecting the venom. And yeah, really letting you have it. And then it travels up and\nit goes into your lymph nodes and into your here and you get a headache. And I think the brilliant thing about the venom of a bullet ant\nis that it makes you feel like this feeling of alarm, it makes you feel like something's wrong. You don't just go, \"Ow, this hurts\" like it's like a bee sting, where you \"Ah, this\nreally hurts on my hand.\" It's like, no, no, no, no. Your whole nervous system is freaking out and you start sweating\nand then you get cold and then you're tired and then you get a little blurry vision. And it's like, yeah\nthat's actually that bad. I mean now after six or seven I get bitten and I'm like kind of okay. - [Lex] So it's a full\nbody, full mind experience. - It's a full body, full mind experience. But then there's places in the\nAmazon where they, you know, stick their hand in a\nglove with like 70 of them. And I think Steve-O did that, which I just don't understand\nhow you could do that without going into complete\nanaphylactic shock and dying 'cause one really sucks. - Well just like we said, with animals and with humans\nthere's different kinds. - [Paul] There's different kinds. - Steve-O is definitely, specially unique. - [Paul] The first of its species. - Whew. On the point of uncontacted tribes, it's interesting to think about what kind of civilizations\nhave there been? This is something that you've\ntalked about a little bit. Graham Hancock has written about ancient civilizations and sort of challenging the conventionals or the mainstream thinking\nabout the civilizations that have been there in the Amazon. Can you steelman and criticize the idea, so the pro and the con of the idea that there have been ancient, advanced ancient\ncivilizations in the Amazon? Like, how much do we know? Or what are all the possibilities\nof what's in the Amazon in its past? - So like, when Orellana\nwent down the Amazon, the reports were that there\nwas great civilizations in the Amazon. And then, you know, a\nfew hundred years later when people got to actually\ncheck up on this stuff, it was all gone. And so was that because of disease that we wiped out all these civilizations and these communities of people? Potentially, probably. Was he just wrong? Probably not. This is a guy that navigated\nby the stars back to Spain after building his own\nboat. Or did he, you know? Or was he trying to just,\nI don't know. I don't know. But there clearly is a long history of complex civilizations in the Amazon. A hundred percent, there's\nno one that can deny that. The thing that I reacted to was that I've heard videos, I've seen\nmoments in podcasts where the narrative becomes not, there's more ancient civilization\ninformation in the Amazon than we previously\nthought, true statement. We're discovering with lidar, and this is what Graham\nHancock is talking about, that we're discovering constantly that there is more civilizations\nthan we thought in various places. The place where I take offense is where they start to\nsay that the Amazon, there's actually articles\nthat are titled this, that the Amazon is a manmade garden, which is not true. - So the actual, which I think\nis a really different idea that the entire ecosystem, everything we've been talking\nabout, all the species, all the forestry and the\ndifferent, just life, life, one of the most\ndiverse ecosystems on earth is initially created by humans. - It's ridiculous. - Well, it's not. First\nof all, it's unlikely, but it's not ridiculous. So we can't, there's no\nridiculous in science. - [Paul] No. - But the complexity of life\nis very difficult to engineer the more you study about\nbiological systems and so on, it's very difficult to\ncreate the kind of things that nature is able to do. That said, I don't know if you've heard, but the entire earth, the world has gone through\na pandemic recently. And everybody said of\ncourse it's natural origins, viruses mutate all the time. And nevertheless, it\nseems more and more likely in this particular case, it was of an artificial\norigin, leaked from a lab. So humans are able to create stuff, at least modern technological\ngenetic engineering. - We made golden retrievers. Come on. - You can't be that nice\nand that good looking. It used to be a wolf, yeah. So that bothers you because\nit allows you to think that we don't need to preserve the Amazon, we can always engineer it. - Yeah, exactly. This is just to me,\nthat's a slippery slope. It's so quick from, I'm a fan of expeditions\nto find ecological ruins and to learn more about the\nancient civilizations to, which I don't think is what\nhe's putting out is that, then sort of like news articles, which I think they're trying to bait you, where they're going,\nwas the Amazon manmade? And it's like, you know. Because then you get a\nBrazilian president that go, \"See? See what they said? It's manmade. So we might as well continue\nto engineer it and manage it.\" And it's like, there's such\ncomplex systems and interactions and such a giant web of life there that, at least in my opinion, is clearly one of the most\nauthentically natural things. And again, are there things\nthat we've engineered, the uncontacted tribes,\nsometimes they have banana plants that they've stolen and we\ncould see it from the air that they have banana plants. We've made banana plants,\nthat's engineered by us, we know for a fact. - [Lex] Agricultural engineering. - Agricultural engineering\nand stuff like that. But suggesting that the\nAmazon basin, you know, it's just a weird way to think about it. I've just heard people dismiss\nthe protection of the Amazon based on the fact they're like,\noh well, if people made it, and it's such a giant leap\nfrom zero to a hundred. Is there slash and burn that\nthe ancient civilizations did? Of course. Are there areas that were\naffected by people? Of course. I just get worried when\nwe start talking about it was a man-made thing. - Yeah, here you loud and clear on that. And I personally think\nthat's completely separate from wondering about what\nthe ancient civilization have been able to accomplish. It's almost really sad because\nif all the humans on earth die now, how long does it take before all signs of humans ever existing disappear for the most part, from an alien perspective? - What timeline are we talking about? I mean, like a hundred thousand years? - It could be less, it could be less. It could be like a few thousand because a hundred thousand\nis complete destruction. - [Paul] Hundred thousand is like nothing. - But then it could be in\njust a few hundred years, it starts becoming, the government of the alien\ncivilization is gonna have to pay quite a bit of money\nto do the research to find, 'cause they're gonna\nfind other life first. They're gonna find the dolphins\nand the fish and so on. They're gonna find the trees, maybe the trees are the interesting thing. The buildings are not that\ninteresting without humans. They crumble.\n- But there must be examples of cities that have been left unattended for a few\ndecades and like how quickly the plants push up through the street and everything starts to get broken down. - If you really look, you'll be like, oh, there's some interesting geometry here for the buildings and so on. But most of the computer stuff, all the stuff of the past hundred years, the airplanes, all of\nthat, all the technologies, all of the paperwork, all the hard drives that\nstore all the information. - I want to actually\nknow how long it takes like a 747 to biodegrade. Like, if you just leave it\nthere sitting on the runway, society stops, how long does it take for\nthat thing to disappear? Like, that's a weird one. - Completely versus to a point\nwhere it's unidentifiable might be different, but. I mean, the point I'm\ntrying to say here is, as you've brilliantly\nput, the Amazon churns. - [Paul] Yeah, oh yeah. - And the fact there, I wonder throughout its history, what are the peaks of the awesomeness? How many banana, how many agricultural Einsteins of bananas were there? They're creating different kinds of ideas, different kinds of geometries,\ndifferent kinds of tools. - Well, yeah, look what the Incas did. I mean the Incas, you know, Machu Picchu. When Hiram Bingham found Machu Picchu, it was covered in jungle, you could hardly see it. And I mean the stonework they did, much like what the Egyptians\ndid with the pyramids, a lot of it we don't really\nunderstand how they did it. If you come to the jungle, you gotta go to Machu Picchu\n'cause it's not far from there. And I usually, like, I'm the person, like, I don't usually go see like the, you know, I've never been to see the Taj Mahal after living in India for\nfive years, like I'm just not. But when you look up and you\nsee Machu Picchu, you go, either they were communicating\nwith the gods there or these people were\nso smart that they knew that anybody they brought,\nthey were gonna impress. They've built something there that when you look up at that\nmountain, you go, \"Whoa,\" with those giant stones,\nthe beauty of it, you know. It's just stunning to imagine that there was this culture of people that could achieve this. And so through the Amazon, I mean that's sort of up in the Andes, but there's all kinds\nof stuff in the Amazon. There are places where\nthey say there's pyramids beneath the canopy that\nwe just don't know about. I mean, it's endless. - If you had billions of\ndollars, trillions of dollars, what would be the efforts in the Amazon, for both conservation and for exploration? Which are tied together. - Yeah, exactly. First,\narrest the deforestation so we don't have an ecological\ncrisis on our hands. We don't wanna keep losing species, losing indigenous cultures, losing the climate stabilizing services that the Amazon provides as a whole. Stop that, that's my first mission. Next, then we can play. And then it's like, let's go find, I mean, I've flown over\nthe Amazon in a Cessna and it's like, you see\nthings where you go, we have to go see what that is. You know, weird lakes, or shapes in the jungle\nthat don't make sense that are strange. - So even at that level,\nyou can see weirdness, you can see different, like,\nsigns of possible awesomeness. - Oh, the jungle is so weird. And here's the other thing is that most, so like the region I've been working in, you see where the researchers go. There's certain biological stations, there's certain places where like, oh, this university has\na relationship with this, this university with this. So everybody goes to the\nsame few study sites, and then they walk on the same trails and they have the same guides. When you fly in a Cessna and you fly a few hours away from all that and you see a tiny little tributary, and then you fly for 40\nminutes over unbroken green, just wild, before you\nreach another tributary. Even if somebody could survive\ngoing up that tributary, had the expeditionary expertise\nand the ability to survive getting shot at by arrows, if they could get up that tributary, now cut perpendicular into\nthe jungle, which I don't do. On the solos, you can never,\ndon't ever leave the river. But you're telling me that\nin that span of 70 miles between tiny tributaries\nat the edge of the world, no one's been there, none\nof us have been there. You know, maybe somebody\n10,000 years ago was there, but we don't know what\npopulations of things are there, we don't know what ruins are there. And so there's so much\nundiscovered stuff in the Amazon that is just waiting, just waiting. - What is the process of exploring that? So how does money get\nconverted towards exploration? Is there safe ways of doing that? - There's places where, you know, we've found out about things\nthat have to be explored. You come up with, well how do we do this without getting shot. And not only without getting shot, but also without endangering them too, 'cause how stupid are we if we go in there to people that are living in\nthe jungle, not bothering us, and we go insert ourselves into there because we're curious about some rocks. That doesn't seem fair for\nthe loss of life, and so like. But yeah, that's something\nthat we're working on. And one thing of course\nis like lidar and stuff, but eventually, at the end of everything, it comes down to boots on the ground. - As somebody who has to\nask that very question about how to deal with uncontacted tribes, they're going to kill you, but you also don't wanna\ndisturb their environment. If you were an intelligent\nalien civilization - [Paul] Oh boy. - and you came about earth, how would you interact with it? Can you put yourself in the\nmind of an alien civilization? 'Cause there seems to\nbe some parallels here. - [Paul] That is actually right,\nit's like a microcosm of... - We're very aggressive, human civilization is very aggressive. So if we were easily, we get threatened easily\nfor stupid reasons, 'cause we start, like, American military probably thinks it's like the Chinese or the Russians if we see any kind of flying objects, it gets very on edge. - I don't know, I mean. 'Cause you know, part of it is like, you just want to ask. Like that's the thing, I\njust want to ask questions. - Yeah, but you don't\nknow the same language. - [Paul] What you gonna get? First of all--\n- You send a boat of bananas. - You send a boat of\nbananas, you get shot. I mean picture if aliens\nlanded in New York, how long would it take for\none of them to get shot? It'd be minutes, it'd\nbe matter of minutes. - [Lex] Yeah, but that's\n'cause it's New York, and everywhere else. - Look where we are right now. (chuckles) - That's true, it'd be\neven worse here, yeah. Makes me wonder what is the\nright way to interact with intelligent life that's not like our own. I dream of in our lifetime\nwe would interact with possibly life on Mars or on one of the moons\nof Jupiter or Saturn. And like, how do you\ninteract with that thing? This very technical, biological\nand chemical processes, but also if there's any\nkind of intelligence, how do you try to communicate\nwith that intelligence? - So we're not talking\nabout like a cockroach, we're talking about like some\nsomething that's clearly like doing things, making things. - Well, cockroach, possibly. How do you know the difference\nbetween a cockroach? Like, how do you know? We were just talking\nabout those elephants. We don't know, we don't know. - Just like a race of like\nphilosopher cockroaches just chilling on the rocks. - Well, here on earth we kind of, there seems to be a strong correlation between size and intelligence. It seems like the bigger things\nhave bigger nervous systems and brains and so they're usually smarter, but that doesn't. - I think it's the ratio, brain to body, 'cause you have like crows that are up among the most intelligent. And it's like the size of the\nbrain to the size of the body. - But there also could\nbe kinds of intelligence who we're completely,\n- [Paul] That we have no idea. - we're not appreciating. Maybe cockroaches, they've\nsurvived the longest. They're talking about us\nright now, this dumb humans. - [Paul] Like, dude.\nThese rocks are so great. - A couple of hundred years, exactly. - Did you hear that Kurt Vonnegut where the two space travelers get lost? This really impacted me as a kid 'cause my dad was an English teacher so he is always quoting\nDostoevsky and Kurt Vonnegut. And there's this two space travelers get crash landed in a cave. And on the walls of the\ncave are the Harmoniums, and these kite-shaped animals and they feed off the\nvibrations of the cave. And that's all they do, they don't hurt each\nother, they just do that. And so for like two years,\nthese travelers are stuck and they're trying to fix their ship. One of them starts playing\nmusic for the Harmoniums, and the Harmoniums love him for the music and they all come around him and he plays this music for him. And finally they fix the ship. And the one guy is like, \"All\nright, let's get outta here.\" And the other guy's like,\n\"You know what, I'm staying.\" He goes, \"I found a place\nwhere I can do good. I'm not hurting anybody and they love me. I'm staying right here.\" - Yeah, this whole ambition\nthing we've got going on, always trying to build the\nbigger boat, bigger thing, that might not be the ultimate conclusion of a happy existence as a civilization. That's one of the possibilities\nwhy we haven't met the aliens yet at scale. 'Cause once you get good\nenough at technology, you realize that happiness\nlies in a peaceful coexistence. It's possible. - So where do you stand\non like aliens now? Like, there's a lot coming\nout about the pilots and the things people have been seeing. And again, I kind of come\nin and out of this stuff, like I'll be in the\njungle for three months. I miss a lot, so like, update me. Are we being contacted right now? - Of course nobody knows,\nbut I tend to believe. My intuition says there's\naliens everywhere, even our galaxy. That's a bigger leap\nbut I believe our galaxy has probably billions, hundreds of millions of\nplanets with life on it, like bacteria type of life. And I believe there is, I don't know, thousands of intelligent\nalien civilizations that exist or have existed. The problem is there's a lot of time, and it's very difficult\nto contact each other. So to achieve a kind of\ncivilization that's able to actually send out enough signal or radiate enough energy\nwhere we would notice, I think that's really tough. That said, statistically speaking, it seems like that\nshould have been possible inside our galaxy or maybe nearby. And so, I suspect that once an alien civilization is\njust many orders of magnitude smarter than us humans, the way it would contact us is going to be very difficult\nfor us humans to understand. We're very ego-centric. We want the message to be\nsent as like a, in English, versus, you know, I think\nconsciousness itself, emotion, thoughts, could be like fingertips, could be words in the story\nthat aliens are telling us, or things that are just like a low-dimensional projection of a much higher dimensional message that's being sent by aliens. And that maybe are striving\nto create technology is to create the kind of sensor that's actually able to\nhear some of the message, maybe that's what AI is trying to do. So I think that bridging\nthat barrier of communication between us and cockroaches, I think that's the biggest challenge. - [Paul] Interesting. - Like, the messages are\nall around us, they're here. I suspect that the\nalien messages are here. The aliens are here, we're\njust too dumb to see it. - So first of all, the imagining planets\nwhere there are, like, just picturing, not a silent planet, but just like a planet\nof alternate life forms. You know, maybe it's not\nsomething that we can communicate and have a conversation with, but just a planet of like\nbutterflies and centipedes and weird, you know, things. - Unfortunately, bacterias,\nfor billions of years, it was bacteria as single cell, prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but they're boring, but yeah. - Animals of some sort in\nan environment of some sort. Imagine that, it would just\nbe such an interesting, beautiful, amazing thing,\nand I'm sure they're out. On that, I'm yeah. - The kind of viruses they got going on. But they could also not\nbe biologically based, they could be different chemistry so you have to be humble to that too. - [Paul] Sure. - But then, you know,\nit depends on the day. Like, I think you caught\nme on that day today, an optimistic one. Sometimes I think we're all, this is all there is because\nyou ask that question the fermi paradox, like,\nwhy aren't they here? You can't imagine an\nadvancing civilization that would not be explorers,\nbecause we're explorers. - Why is that depressing to you? The idea that... Let's just say you\nfound out right now that there isn't anything else. Let's just say that\nfor example's sake that the earth is the earth and\nthe universe is the universe, and it's sort of like the\nbackdrop of a video game, and it's just what's out there. Would that be tremendously\ndepressing to you? - I think it's exciting for an engineer, it's probably exciting for an explorer. But I would equate that\nto your going out hiking for three days with one match. It kind of terrifies me\nthat we only got one match. - Really?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Really? - Yeah, one. All you got is one match. No, no, no, hold on a\nsecond. Hold on a second. Paul, wait a minute. You're going out, there's no more matches, this is the only match you got. - But no one's gonna\nextinguish the planet. Like there's not, as far as we know, there's no meteor coming. I'm saying like, do you live in a, so what I'm saying is that is your worry then that we\nneed to have a backup plan? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Really? So what if we do mess it up so bad that we can't live here anymore? - Well, there's different\nways to mess it up. There's ways to mess it up to\nmake life really difficult. - [Paul] You have \"Mad\nMax\" type of things. - But there's nuclear war with a further and further\nadvancement of technology that can destroy all of our, it just feels like that's going\nto be exponentially growing. - [Paul] Yes, it's gonna get worse. - Listen, I'm very optimistic, but it's a heck of a Russian\nroulette we're playing. - Okay. But I'm still curious\nabout your intention though, or like where your passion\nfor this comes from. Or maybe it's both, but is it the need to have a backup plan for humans, which is admirable for your\nintense love of humanity and our consciousness and\nlove and art and everything, or is it also just that\nthe raw fascination of imagining what's out there? Because the way you said that about like, oh, you caught me on a positive\nday where I think it's, there was something in\nthere that made me think that you need there to be. - Ah, yeah. I think I'm the kind of person that sees beauty in everything, but to me, a universe full of diverse life is more beautiful than one\nwhere it's just humans. It's just the earth life. - [Paul] Interesting. - There's more beauty. I mean, I'm not egotistical\nabout the awesomeness of humans. I like if humans are not the smartest in our galaxy, or not even\nclose to being the smartest. And that to me is, I don't know. That that to me is exciting\nabout the possibility of what the universe can create. - Yes, I'm with you on that, that it's wildly exciting to... Like if we found, even if it was just a distant inkling that we found out that there\nis a planet that has life. There's no communication coming from it, but we know for a fact\nthere's stuff going on there. It would just change how we\nthink about our entire reality. We know now. - And it could be, to me, I guess the little\ninkling of a thing, that is depressing. If all there is is earth and humans destroy it, then we are the coolest thing that the universe has\never created. (chuckles) It's over. - I'm interested to\nhave this conversation. I'm really, I'm saying like, I would be interested to\nbring you to the jungle. Now I'm also wondering, I'm wondering like what your\nwilderness experience is because I feel like for me, I'm so earth-centric to\nthe point where I'm like, we differ in that. For me, this is, like, it's a curiosity. I feel wonder and I feel\nit's fun to talk about like what's at the edge of space, like, you know, there's the\nconundrums of space time. To me I'm like, what if the aliens are watching us, or what if the aliens aren't watching us? But what if the challenge here\nis we've been put on earth as the most intellectually\ncomplex of these creatures and we're being observed\nto see how we manage it. And it's like, we haven't made a good job of managing each other. You know, before Orellana\nwent down the Amazon they showed up and just sacked the Incas. I mean, read our history, I\nmean, I don't have to tell you, just got back. Sometimes I wonder, you know, is there a grand narrative with what we're doing to wildlife? Because it's like we have\nall these other species and we're struggling even\nhere in this conversation to sort of quantify like, you know. And I think that most people don't think outside of the human framework,\nyou know what I mean, like, just driving around. For me, living outside of the jungle, even just for a few weeks I get, you don't even think about the fact that there's other species around us, we really don't day to day. You look at TV and you listen\nto the radio and it doesn't, it's not very consequential\nto the average person living in a city that\nthere are these, you know, islands covered in walruses\nand that there's rainforests filled with birds and frogs and all these things happening. The salmon are contributing\nto our fresh water and that life is literally\ngiven to us and made possible by these ecological systems. To me, that's where like the whole essence of my existence comes from. - Yeah, thank you for that reminder, because you're basically saying\nlike the alien civilizations you dream about are here on earth. Those worlds are here. - [Paul] For me, yeah. - No, I agree with you. I think I agree with you, and I think that's actually the way I think most of the time. I think I'm on mushrooms all the time, genetically somehow because\nwhen I go out in nature, it's just the beauty, even of nothing, you talk about the Amazon, man, just basics of nature fill me with awe. The other thing that fills me with awe is our own mind, like the\nbiology of these things firing. Basically, not our own mind, but biology of any living organisms 'cause it's like an ecosystem. These cells came together,\nthey somehow function, they delegate, they mostly\noperate in a local way. First of all, it's just like\nyou said with the anacondas, you start out as a tiny\nsnake and you become giant. When you're a tiny snake,\nyou're prey for everything, when you're a giant\nsnake, you're a predator, or you're prey to no one. And just that whole process, same starting with a single\nembryo, single cell as a human. And through the embryogenic process, constructing this giant human\nthat's able to have limbs, move about the world, think about things, write books and so on. So you see that that is\nincredibly beautiful, and all of that is here on earth, yes. And so actually I was being\nsort of poetic about aliens and so on. I think I can spend 99.99% in terms of filling my\nmind with awe and beauty just looking down here on earth. For sure, I agree with you. - Yeah, and they shouldn't cancel out. Like, I think it's beautiful that there's people that are\nfascinated and obsessed with looking out into space\nand that will travel there. I mean, just to me, the idea of, I mean I have a little\npiece of meteorite at home that I hold. It does amazing things to\nmy mind 'cause I'm like, everything I've ever\ntouched is from this earth, and I'm holding this\nthing that's been places that we can't even think about. And it blows my mind and I love it. But when it comes to like intelligence, I think it's like, I'm so\nconcerned with the fact that we're at this moment in history, and it's interesting to me that, you know, we had the internet and now\nthat with the emergence of AI and more and more I feel like\nwe are starting to resemble like an ant colony, where\nthere's more and more connection, and there's more and more interaction globally between everybody. In the next 10 years,\nwe're gonna have to decide, are we gonna let our ocean\necosystems just collapse? Are we gonna just take\nthat 3% of rainforest and just let them log the shit\nout of it until it's gone? And it's like, we're gonna be in a very different reality then, then it's gonna be very dystopian future. Or, can we keep the good things\nabout earth, transcend that, realize that we have these\nincredible alien species around us that are animals\nthat we grew up with, that we wouldn't be here without,\nthat we owe something to. And I feel like at that stage then the outward look becomes something else. It's almost like we've proven, if aliens came up to us,\nthat's when I'd feel good. Aliens would come up to us and they said, you know, Louie has the\nthing where he goes, God comes back and he\ngoes, what did you do? He goes, the polar bears are brown. He's like, I left food for you. And it's like, if the aliens\ncame and were like, you know, and they interviewed the elephants and they said, \"How are you feeling?\" And the elephants would be like, \"Listen, fuck these little primates. You know what they've done to us?\" And it's like, I mean, you know, I've seen people break an elephant, I've seen it all with that stuff. And it's like, if anybody was to ask them, they'd be screaming. And so like to me, it's just, you know, I have trouble looking out into space, I have trouble looking out\ninto normal life as a human because I'm so concerned\nwith trying to make sure that they're okay because not\nenough people are doing that. - Well, the interesting thing\nabout all the development with AI and just that we're living more and more of our life online, I think we're actually learning what's missing when it's online. Like, I think people realize that online interaction is shallow, but we're just learning\nthat that's a reality, that we need that human connection. And I think there's going to\nbe the swing back to like, sadly, AI systems of the future might be able to live\nfulfilling lives online, but us humans have to have\na deep connection with earth and like with each other\nand physical connection. I think there's going to be a\nphase somewhere in the century where we go back to deep\nphysical connection, and there'll be a digital\nworld that we visit that will be separate. You have discussion\nwith that, with Twitter, with Instagram, with all\nthese social networks that they seem to be dividing us, they seem to not be bringing happiness. And you have to try to\nfigure out like, okay, so how do we use them in a way that does connect us, does educate\nus, grow our knowledge base, but also keeps our lives fulfilling in a deep human way that we're for good and for bad genetically designed that we can't overcome,\nthat we can't escape these meat vehicles. - Yeah, but to me that's so reassuring. We all have those friends\nthat are like, you know, we gotta live forever. And it's like, I don't know man, do you? I don't know. Is it that bad\nthat this is how it works, like, that we don't understand it? - Yeah, and it's often\nfrom the tech sector that you have discussions\nabout immortality and so on. I think that's somehow trying to escape the beauty of this earth that there's something beautiful. - [Paul] Too bright to look at. - Yeah. And I perhaps\nlike you am worried about the unintended negative\nconsequences of trying to escape the way things are on this earth because this is an incredible mechanism. - How many times in the past\nhas new technology come out that people have hailed as\nblasphemy, or it's not gonna work or it goes against nature. And now, well, heart\ntransplants are pretty cool. You could say what you\nwant about like television and like, you know, it rots your brain. It's like, yeah, but also how many times have you sat in a room full\nof people being entertained and all laughing and\ninteracting and eating popcorn because of the televisions there? And it's not one or the other. And so I feel like with AI, we'll learn our way through it, you know. - Like with the legged robots especially, and humanoid also. So anything on legs,\nfour legs or two legs. I remember like the\nfirst time I interacted with a legged robot, I saw a magic there, that this too can have consciousness, this too can have this life-like quality that a human being loves\nabout other human beings, about other living creatures. Now, while I'm still, I grew up in the place with no internet in a time with no internet, so I still like biological dogs better. I noticed the magic in robotic dogs, and it makes me wonder, same way we're just talking\nabout aliens looking up, it makes you wonder about\nother aliens civilizations. Now the deep love is for\ndogs, for other humans, but there's still this wander. - Ah, I struggle with that. Like you said, whatever's\ngoing on in here, the idea, and there's so\nmuch talk about the fact, like at what point does an\nartificially-intelligent robot become something that has, and it's like I get very\nuncomfortable with that. It makes me... I don't know how to handle the things 'cause I don't know\nenough about it probably. But it's like, I don't know how to handle. - I don't know how to handle either, nobody knows anything about\nit because it's really, everything is terrifying here. It could be as simple as\nconsciousness is easy to fake. So what if we live in a world\n10 to 20 years from now where your toaster, there's a\nbunch of robots in your room that are faking consciousness. And then you fall in love with them and you have a deep connection with them, and then you actually\nhave a deeper connection with your toaster than you do with any romantic human partner you've ever had. And you start to-- - I was upset about the dogs. I was like, at least the robot doesn't take a shit on the floor. You just took it way worse. - Yeah, yeah. And then they start to, I don't know if you've seen AI porn, but it gets pretty intense. - Like, fully AI porn?\nLike, they're fake people? - [Lex] Fake people take people that can-- - Things I've missed in the jungle. - Things. (chuckles) Boy do I have a lot to show you, or not show you, not show you. Let me ask you about a touchy topic, climate change. What's the effect of climate\nchange on the Amazon, maybe species diversity. What is something that\npeople should think about? Because there's different views on, I think most people\nbelieve that climate change is human-caused and that it's happening, but there is different\nperspectives on the degree of damage that it's\ngoing to do over the next several decades and what\nour response should be as a society. And so it would be amazing to\nhear your perspective on it, in small slices of your\nexperience or in large. - To me, there's no denying the fact that we are experiencing changes. I think anybody that\ndoesn't agree with that hasn't been outside in the last 20 years, or hasn't interviewed old farmers who will tell you that\nit changed or, you know. I think a lot of us can agree with that. Where I deviate is that I\nam not a climate scientist, I am not qualified, and so I just like\neverybody else am listening. And what happens to me is I see that someone like Santiago Durand, JJ's father, will tell me, \"It's totally\ndifferent than it was when I was a kid, the seasons have changed and moved.\" In New York when I was a kid, we used to get like white Christmas, like we used to get snow. I was in shorts. I came off the plane right before coming here and\nI was in shorts for a second. I was like, this is a different reality. But my ability or my\ninterpretation of climate change, you know, I feel like is just as dumb as those people that go like, it's really cold, I thought\nthey said it was getting warmer. It's like, it's a very rudimentary thing. And so as a someone that's fighting for the preservation of biodiversity, I don't feel like I'm any more qualified than the average person. I can only provide anecdotal evidence of the stuff I've seen. What I do do though, and I always make a\nstrong delineation here, is that I can speak to the\nfact that I've been places where the ocean fisheries\nhave been depleted and the local fishermen can tell you, and the scientists can tell\nyou there's no more fish here. I've been to the places\nwhere the rainforest line is being pushed back in Borneo and it's getting smaller\nand smaller and smaller. And I've been in the Amazon and I've walked through the killing fields and through the fires and\nI've burnt my lungs on it. And I'm a big believer, personally, in instead of trying to take on all of it, I've tried very hard in\nmy life to pick one thing. And to me that one thing is protecting as many wild heartbeats as I can because they're under constant fire. And so climate change, you know, there's so much arguing over it, and like you said, the\ndegree to which we affect it. And how do you, you know what I mean? Like, I like to have provable data points. I can show you tropical deforestation, I can show you the decline in tigers over the last a hundred years, I can't prove, you know what I mean? Like, I can't answer that\nquestion, I don't think, probably you can better than I can. - No, I think one of the criticism I'd love to get your opinion on is one of the criticisms that somebody like Jordan Peterson provides is that the climate is\nsuch a complex system, there's so many variables that making conclusive statements about what's going to happen with\nthe quote, unquote \"climate\" in the next 10, 20, 50 years is a nearly impossible task. Therefore, as he would say, as people like Björn Loberg would say, the kind of fear mongering that is done saying we should spend\nhumongous amounts of money to change the trajectory\nof everything we're doing in terms of energy, in terms of infrastructure and so on, in terms of how we allocate\nmoney is not justified because predicting is very difficult. And instead, it's better\nexactly what you're saying, which is focusing on local problem, (chuckles) local, saying we need to protect the Amazon. What are the things attacking\nthe Amazon this year in the next five years? How can we stop the deforestation? How can we stop different things? And humans are exceptionally good at coming up with solutions for that, especially when you put money behind it, you put attention to it. And that's the way we solve\nall the different problems that are projected for the climate change in its worst case scenarios\nto be realized on this earth. So that's kind of the case he would make. And I should also mention\nthat one of the reasons I was fortunate enough\nto discover your work is, first, a friend mentioned that I should definitely talk to you, and then I Googled you. And I saw that somebody recommended that Jordan Peterson\nabsolutely must talk to you on his podcast.\n- Oh, wow. - [Lex] I think it was like a Reddit post. - Thank you, Reddit poster, that's great. - And I was like, oh, interesting. And then I looked, and Jordan hasn't yet. I thought my goal is\nfor you to talk to Rogan and to Jordan Peterson\nfor different reasons, but for the same reason, they get connected to a human being that deeply cares about this earth. And I think that's probably\nthe right lens through which to look at the effects of climate change in terms of focusing\non the different things that are threatening\nthe diversity of species in this most magical place on\nearth, which is the Amazon. But also, as you talk about\nwith elephants and tigers in India, and focusing on\nhow to solve those problems. I don't know if there's\nany comment you wanna make on folks like Jordan Peterson who are sort of raising questions about how much do we really\nunderstand about the climate. - First of all, I'm such\na Jordan Peterson fan, and I think the guy is heroic\nfor a number of reasons. And I find his use of language\nand his use of theology and the message that\nhe puts out wonderful. I cringe a little bit when he says, I feel like, and I might not\neven be accurate on this, but I cringe a little bit\nwhen I feel like he dismisses that there is an ecological\nemergency happening right now. Now, I'm not saying, I'm not talking about\nclimate change specifically, but I've heard him say, you know, \"Environmentalists upset me.\" And he goes, \"Well, what do\nyou mean by the environment, everything?\" And it sort\nof seems to outrage him. And I kind of agree\nwith him there because, so are you telling me that we need to halt our global process and progress and economies and everything? I don't know, I don't know. So to me, that doesn't bother me because he's exploring what the hell are these\npeople talking about. I personally have friends and students and people filling my inboxes, I have young kids telling\nme that they've become vegan and they ride a bicycle and\nsometimes they don't watch TV 'cause it uses electricity, and I mean, they're just\nbecoming so terrified of they're killing the earth. And so it's this doomsday\nanti-human sentimentalist thing that we're evil. It's almost like a new\nreligion about your evil. And so to me, it almost makes me in a totally different camp where like climate change\nand the right/left politics, and you know, I can sit at a family, I can see the Thanksgiving dinner and listen to the climate\nthing go back and forth. And I'm like, I'm not even here. And that might actually annoy some people in the environmental field that might feel betrayed\nby me saying that. But I don't care. My job, and it's not just the Amazon, and that's one note that\nI wanted to make is that my career has taken place\nlargely in the Amazon and also in India and now a lot in Africa. It's not even just these\nexotic places either it's people realizing that, you know, the salmon runs in Canada and the butterfly\ngardens in our backyards. There's biodiversity everywhere. And I strongly feel like, you know, the idea of Junglekeepers, the idea of stewards of nature. And so for me, my job, my one thing, and I try to tell this to\nthese kids that message me and my inboxes are full\nof this where they go, you know, the climate is burning and elephants are in decline\nand tigers, and this and that. I'm like, guys look, first of all, calm down, first of all. Like, go outside, go get laid, do something, have fun. Next, pick something that you can affect and it doesn't have to\nbe with the environment. Do something good on earth. Go help somebody that needs food. Go help your elderly\nneighbor, whatever it is. Practice with being effective\nat one thing at a time. And so for me, like I\nsaid from those early days of sitting there with JJ on\nthe side of a river and going, someone has to protect this. My concern is that we've\nlost 70% of the wildlife on this planet in the last 50\nyears, that's a huge problem. Wildlife maintain the ecosystems. And so I have a very\nclear cut, very definable, very measurable and provable thing that I'm fighting against, and to me, it's a very small ask, don't cut down the 3% of the world that has 50% of the biodiversity in it. Maybe let's keep some wild\ntigers for future generations because tigers have their own\ninherent right to exist here. That's my thing. In terms of when we get to, you know, I get attacked for, you\nknow, you should be a vegan. Okay. You have me roll into a village in the Amazon when they\noffer me spider monkey and you tell me that I should be a vegan, you see how much they respect you when you tell them that you're a vegan. But no. So for someone like Peterson, I think it's actually good that he's first of all telling everyone\nto make their damn beds, and exploring it through a different lens. He's coming at it from a totally\ndifferent thing and saying, are we just being alarmist here? I mean, again, imagine\nif there isn't a problem and they're making one out of it and all the implications that\nthat could have for progress. So I think what he's doing\nis perfectly reasonable. There is a podcast though where he's, it was a great one though, where he's discussing animal intelligence. And I could really see that the human psyche and theology and religion is so much his world that really the idea of animals\nbeing intelligent was novel, and it was fascinating. - Yeah, that's why I would love\nfor the two of you to talk. I don't know, and hopefully\nI'm not outta line here, but he is so focused on the human mind that I think he forgets that there's other life out there. There's this whole\nmachine of intelligence, of a kind of intelligence out there. This entire trillions of\nspecies, tiny and big, just everywhere, and we're actually part of it. So to look at it, human\npsychology is distinct from that is missing at least some of the picture. - Some of the picture. I do believe though I would\nagree with him on that humans are unique. Human psychology is unique, we just are. He's in such an interesting\nplace because usually you have, you know, environmentalists\nwho are like, you know, nature, nature, nature, and that's very anti-human, and then you have the other side. And it's like he's on this path where he's starting to explore what those diverse intelligences mean. And that to me is really amazing 'cause I love hearing\nwhat he'll do with that. - And I think also on top of that, I think if you're aware of\nnature, deeply aware of nature, it gives you another perspective on the evolutionary history of humans. Like, it is one thing to be\nan evolutionary biologist and kind of study it from\na philosophical perspective and it's the other to\nreally I think experience it and deeply know and to see, I don't know, the fact that we came from fish and really be cognizant of that. That's something else. That's like, I don't know, to realize that we're part\nof a computing machine that created intelligence. We're part of the thing\nthat started bacteria and is now creating AI and I don't know, Dunking Donuts, I don't know what else is impressive. - [Paul] The other\ngreat human achievement. - It is the other great human. I was thinking, what's\ninteresting about Boston? - But I feel like we keep\nscratching up against this thing in this conversation that it's so easy, I think something like 50 or more percent of the humans on this\nplanet live in cities. And I think it's so easy for people to forget\nthat we share this planet with so many other things. And I think that that sort of, in a way, we're almost\nlike ecological orphans and that we've left the things that actually make us feel at home. And that's a bit of a stretch 'cause I don't know if\neverybody feels that way, but for me, I mean professionally\nas an expedition guide, when I take people into nature, I see what happens to them. And they leave going, I mean it doesn't have to be the Amazon, it could be, you know, upstate New York. But it's like, if you do it the right way, if you remove the fear of breaking an ankle, seeing a snake, being bitten by a\nmosquito, all that stuff, if you can get people to a peaceful moment and you're fly fishing, a lot of times they'll take that moment and they'll talk about\nit the rest of their life if they don't live in that, then there's those of us who\nspend our lives doing that, but for a reason because it's\nthe only place we feel sane. - And you were kind enough to suggest that we might travel together\nfor a time at some point. If we do that, if we journey together, where would you recommend we should go? - So what I would wanna show you is sort of, I'd want\nto take you to church, I'd want to take you\nto see the giant trees, take you to meet the old gods, really. There's places when you\nwalk in off the river that are so deep in the forest, you know, and again, now we do this, we have the boats, we have the rangers, we protect this ecological corridor now. And so it would be taking you\nto meet some of those loggers that we converted. It'd be taking you, we'd have\nto go to the floating forest, meet some of the trees\nthat I love the most, go piranha fishing. And like, really just spend, my ideal trip for you would be to spend five days of airplane-mode phone, completely living out comfortable. I'm not saying, I don't wanna torture you, I'm saying go and live\ncomfortably on an expedition in the Amazon. And that means a few days\nat this research station, maybe go upriver three days and camp up here just on the edge of where the uncontacted are, and then come back and then\nsee the Junglekeepers station. But along the way, seeing all\nthe special sacred places, it would be almost like\nsaying, like, let's go see all the treasures of Italy. It's like, this is one of the most beautiful things on earth, and I've had the incredible,\nalmost unbelievable fortune to be responsible for protecting it. I think it's a privilege to be able to share that with people. - To be able to witness\nwhat this earth has created. It's been just a gift just\neven to follow your Instagram, the window you create on\nthis part of the world is just really beautiful. I do wanna ask on that, maybe it's like behind\nthe scenes a little bit, like, how do you keep the equipment dry? How do you, like how hard is bringing\nequipment, the cameras? You're an incredible\nfilmmaker and photographer, so how do you make it work? - I don't know, it's not that hard. - [Lex] Really? It's wet.\n- It's not that bad. It is wet. The new iPhones are waterproof. And if they don't get, I'm telling you dude,\nit's been such a weapon, it's been awesome. If you drop it in the river, my one thing is you gotta have a tether 'cause I drop it all the time. And so I'll be hanging off a boat and I'll be trying to take a video, and I'll be like, here\nwe are in the Amazon, you can see the line and\n(imitates water plopping). That's the biggest thing. We shoot on Canons. I don't know, it's worked\nout, it's not that bad. - Oh really? So you can\nkeep the equipment dry. - I keep the equipment\ndry and I actually don't, a lot of people put\ntheir in silica at night and keep it dry and then they take it out. And I find that when you do that, the temperature change creates\nmoisture inside the camera. So what I do is I never do that, I just keep my cameras in\nmy backpack with a zipper so they're more or less\nexposed to the elements. And so it sort of always has\na little bit of equilibrium, and that's it. I mean, I shoot on some pretty\nfancy equipment sometimes and it's great. But I mean the awesome thing\nthough now is that like, with a cell phone, I mean like, I put my phone down on\nthe ground a few weeks ago and let this rhino walk\nup to it and stuff. And it's like, you can get video footage that you can literally put on Netflix. It's getting really exciting, and that's where I deviate\nfrom the nature people that are like we need to\ngo back and live in cabins. I'm like, dude, this is awesome. And I love taking slowmos, like, no way. - It makes you re-appreciate,\nbut just by yourself, just re-appreciate over and over and over and then you can also\nshare it with the world. - Well, that's the thing\nof sharing it with people, there's nothing better than like teaching a kid to catch a fish. In a way Instagram has\nallowed us to do that where it's like, I can\nhave this crazy ass moment that is so unique and then\nput it up for people to see. I mean, I remember one\nof the most recent things that got people, you never know what's\ngonna get people excited. I literally just like, there was like 3000 butterflies on the beach and they were all like\nblack, red, and blue, beautiful butterflies. And I just like panned the phone across it and then like jumped in\nthe river and swam away. And threw that up on Instagram\nand people went berserk. They're like, this is\nthe most amazing thing and like four different\naccounts reached out to try and share it. And I was like, butterflies,\nthey're everywhere. There's is 4,000 species\nof butterfly in the Amazon. But sharing that with people is beautiful. - How do you find the thing to shoot? How do you come up with the butterflies? How do you notice the\nthing that's beautiful and say, I'm going to\nwait a minute, like pause, this is beautiful, let me\ntake a picture of this, because like sometimes\nyou might get used to the beauty, right? - Yeah. Or like sometimes\nsimple crazy things like leafcutter ants,\nthey're just walking by, it becomes pedestrian. It's like, well. I mean, just like when you're\nliving at the elephant camp and it's like the elephant comes out and he starts like\ntrashing the water bucket. We're like, \"Would you stop? We're trying to watch\n'Peaky Blinders' here. Just leave us alone.\" It becomes normal after a while. But no, in the jungle, that's never a struggle for\nme, because as a photographer, it's like whenever my eye\nhits on something I went, I've never seen that\nmany of those butterflies all the same species together. Oh yeah, I'm trying to get this one thing that the butterflies do\nis in the dry season, the salt deposits, you'll\nget like three or four, maybe 5,000 butterflies all\ncoming onto this one area of sand 'cause there'll\nbe like some leaching, there'll be some salt\ndeposit there or something. And they'll all be wings\nflat against the ground with their proboscises on the sand. And if you go walk near them, they will vortex up and\nyou have a rainbow vortex of butterflies, and you can\nlike go run through that. And it's surreal. What I wanna do is get the shot where I, I guess leave the phone\nrecording in slowmo facing up, and leave it there for an hour. Let the butterflies come in and settle and then disturb them so I get the bottom of\nthe vortex of the bug. I'm like, these are the\nways I think where I'm like, how can I show people the\nabsolute mind-blowing, you know, perfection.\n- [Lex] With an iPhone? That's amazing.\n- I mean, that's what I have, I'm sure that somebody\nelse could do it with a red and nail it, but it's like, that's what I have in the jungle because I have to travel light. - Yeah, I think that works. It was the same thing when\nI was traveling in Ukraine. The equipment was just that suitcase over there with the foam. And you just shove it full of equipment and who cares?\n- [Paul] Do the best you can. - You can go to war\nzone, it doesn't matter. It has to do with the, you were talking about like\nprotecting your camera or not, it feels like the more you protect stuff, the more it's gonna get damaged. - Yeah. Like, see my\ncameras, they're all missing, this is amazing to me. So all my cameras are missing the, how you can see the\nmetal through the paint, so all this because I'm constantly, I'll like slide in and take a picture. They're banged up but\nthey're good machines. - I think they get tough over\ntime if you put 'em through, it's like the immune. - It's like muscles. It's like David Goggin's cameras, you gotta make 'em suffer every day. - Yeah. What's your view on hunting? So you really hate poachers. - I really hate poachers. - How do they operate? Who are they? What are they up to? What do they do? - Poachers to me are the\npeople that are going in and annihilating wildlife\nfor profit without any, you know, the people that are going in and machine-gunning an\nelephant to take its tusks. The people that are sneaking\ninto protected areas in Africa and shooting rhinos so that they can cut off their horns before the animal's even dead\nwhile it's baby is beside it. And there's a difference\nbetween a poacher and a hunter. I'm a hunter, JJ's a hunter. I work with an organization\ncalled VETPAW in Africa, and they use United States\nveterans who have come back, post 9/11 veterans who\nhave come back from the war and have these skills. And they've been using\nthese guys to protect the last black rhinos,\nwhite rhinos, elephants. And so, I've gotten to see this play out on a private reserve in Africa\nwhere these incredible people have decided to protect\nzebra's, wildebeest, all types of impala, giraffes, several herds of elephants,\nwhite rhinos, black rhinos, all of this stuff is protected. And what's interesting is\nit's a hunting preserve. And so it's been very\ninteresting and challenging sharing my work there with the\npublic because, for instance, I went to a very high-profile\nphotographer recently and I said, \"You have to\nget over here and see this.\" It's amazing what these people have done, it's this reserve called Buffalo Kloof. This rescued families of\nelephants and they have, you can see a black rhino\nevery day if you want to. They're critically endangered. And it's because of the\nwork that VETPAW does, protecting these animals from poachers. But what people don't\nunderstand is that hunting happens all the time on the reserve, not for the elephants and the rhinos, those are special and they\nwill never be hunted there. But things like an impala,\nthings like an inhala, a wildebeest, a zebra. There aren't as many\npredators as there used to be. So if you leave those animals unhunted, you know, without the\nwolf to chase the herd to thin off the ones that\nare old and dying or sick, well then you just have animals that are old and dying and\nsick walking around suffering. And so on reserves like this, they hunt, and they take the old ones, and they use the funding from hunting. No one's gonna pay you $30,000 to take a picture of a buffalo, but they'll pay you\n$30,000 to hunt a buffalo. And so these reserves\nresponsibly and ethically on foot can go hunting and manage. And again, if they were hunting rhinos or if they were hunting\nelephants, I'd be out in a second. - They're hunting non-endangered species. - They're hunting non-endangered species, they're hunting game species. And the difference is\nthat a poacher is gonna, and so those are responsible\nhunters that are ecologists and conservationists, whereas a poacher is\nsomeone that will come in and kill recklessly and murder an animal for no reason for a part to sell. - I would love to travel\ntogether actually. So we'll talk offline, I would love to make that\nhappen, if you allow me. - I'm a hundred percent serious, man. I've tremendous respect for your work and I've been watching\nyou since the beginning. I would love to do that together. - I've talked to Joe quite a bit about it, and I really love the\nidea of eating the meat that I've hunted. It's mostly what I eat is meat, not for dietary, I don't\nhave any weird constraints on my diet and so on, I just really enjoy eating meat. - [Paul] It's really good. - And there is a part\nof me that's bothered by factory farming, that it's very easily-accessible meat but there's something\ndeeply wrong with it. Part of the reason I love fishing and eating the fish that I catch, it just seems to be more ethical, but also a more intimate, deep connection, honest connection with nature. You get to see the killing of\nthe food that you're consuming versus removing that from the picture, not even thinking about it, not thinking about that\nthis came from the meat. I love the idea that I kill one animal and I eat that animal\nbasically for the whole year. - Yeah. An ethically-slaughtered animal, whether it's a fish or\na deer or whatever else, to me that's, oh God, I'm gonna use the\nwrong religious term here, but there's a, I feel like I wanna use\nthe word like sacrament, but it's like, there's a deeply profound ritual. And honestly, if you teach\na kid to grow a vegetable, you show a kid how to grow a carrot and the miracle of like, wait I put a, this thing just grew in there, it just appeared because\nthere was sunlight? And it's like, yeah. To me, yes, when you feel\nthat fish tug on the line, to me it does something that awakens a deep primal\nsomething, this satisfaction. And then when you eat that you feel good. The other thing sort of\nfunctionally speaking is that, aside from the fact that I\nthink it's one of the original, we are so disconnected,\nlike we should be hunting. We should be gathering, walking more. I mean, look at what we discussed now, like people are like, oh,\nyou gotta get your steps in for the day. And it's like, that never\nused to be a problem. You know, people are like,\nshould we be eating animals? And it's like, what do you\nthink we do here on earth? Like, I'm not sure how\nyou got so confused, but Walmart did it to you. Like, I don't know. Living where I've lived, I mean, from 18 to 35, I\nfeel like I've grown up, I've lived more outside\nthan I have inside. It just to me like showing\npeople these things, I can see this miraculous\nwonder in their eyes when they realize that they\ncan reach out into the world and interact with something. So when I hear these frantic\npeople talking about, you know, whether or not it's right, no, of course it is. Then again, factory farming is awful, but I try and walk the line. I'm worried about wild animals, I'm worried about wild ecosystems. The other thing that's sort of important about hunting is that if people's livelihoods\ndepend on salmon and elk and ocean fisheries, well then they'll fight\nto protect it naturally because it's part of their life. If everybody's going to Burger King and everybody's getting\nchicken wrapped in plastic, they forget that the fish are there because they're too busy watching sitcoms. And so when the conglomerate\ncomes in and builds a dam, nobody really cares. And then you just end up\nwith a few hippies and signs standing next to the river\nand it becomes silly. We forget the meaning. - You mentioned that ayahuasca reveals... - [Paul] Oh boy. Oh no. - the darkness that's there in the jungle. There's beauty, but there's darkness. So what is it that ayahuasca reveals? What is the heart of darkness? - Fuck, it opens the heart\nof darkness right up. I'm gonna show you a picture of our shaman and then I'm gonna ask you if\nyou wanna do ayahuasca here, not here in that sense, it can only be done in the jungle. Anybody that tells you,\nI've heard people be like, \"Oh, I did ayahuasca\nin Brooklyn last week\" and I'm like, no you didn't. I actually told that to my native friends. I went, \"Hey, guess what?\" I said, \"A bunch of gringos keep thinking they're doing\nayahuasca in Brooklyn.\" And they were like, howling, laughing. They're like, \"You can't\ndo it outside the jungle.\" And I was like, \"Exactly.\" - I've never done\nayahuasca, I would love to. I've done or eaten whatever mushrooms, it's a wonderful experience. - I think it's wonderful. But ayahuasca, oh man, see I had done mushrooms,\nI thought I was okay. You know, I was like I got this. I had my notebook, I was like, I'm gonna\njournal a little bit. I quickly, quickly realized\nhow out of my depth I was and how unprepared I was\nfor what was happening 'cause you sit in a circle\nwith these native guys. And there's one, he's got\nthe feathers and he is old, and he is got a face like\nthe map of the world, and he's smoking this\nfat, old tobacco thing. He calls you forward and\nyou kneel before him, and you're going, is\nit too late to back up? And everyone's, you\nknow, he has one candle and he blows smoke over the\ncup and he hands it to you. And you're like, again, it's these things that you can't argue\nwith, it's these facts. You're like, as soon as this\ngoes down, I'm gone. I know it. And this is a moment in my\nlife that I have to either embarrass myself in front of everybody or I'm going forward with this. And then I went and sat. And you're sitting in the dark. Again, so we're on a platform\nwith palm-thatched roof, the jungle is all around you, so all those tens of millions\nof frogs and insects. And I'm like, all right, cool. And I remember, I tried to\nlight a cigarette or something, and I went, oh, that's not gonna happen. And then I put my hands on the floor. My experience, I mean, like, you've done mushrooms so you know, it's interesting, it's introspective. No, this was like somebody\nunzipped the universe. Without boring people with it,\nI spent a lot of time in like unconstructed dream space,\nlike, floating between nebulas. Like, there's a long period where there was no physical shape\nwhere I lived without a name. It's like you get brought so deep down, so elementally lost in the universe where I truly felt like I was experiencing moving through places like that asteroid that I have. It's like a piece of, you're a piece of something\ndetached from the earth. And so I got back from it, had a interesting new\nappreciation for life. I strongly suggest that\npeople just do mushrooms like a normal person, unless you're ready. - [Lex] So it was really intense. - It was really intense. But to be fair, the shaman who did it was like the old school guy. And he was getting up there in years and he had forgotten\nand overboiled the brew. And so we came back and it\nwas like four in the morning, and I had, you know, all this crazy shit, I had been on journeys\nand years down there. And so when I came back and I had hands, I started crying, I\nstarted absolutely weeping. - [Lex] Gratitude or what? - Gratitude that I was alive, I was gonna get to see my people again. I was like, I'm gonna get\nto see my parents again. I'm gonna get to talk-- - So you kinda thought\nyou might have been gone. - I was gone, I was gone. I was a dimly-conscious\nsomething floating in dark space and spent what felt like years down there. I really did feel like being reborn, which I was like, cheap trick. But no, the way it moves\nyou through the jungle, the way the jungle\nmoves through your skin, there are moments of absolute majesty and incredible discovery\nthat happen along the way. And on the way up, the\njungle brings you up and the shaman brings you up and you get to move through\nthe forest in a way that it's almost like you're inhabiting the consciousness of animals. Very, very, very, like, I didn't think that\nhallucinogenics could do this to a brain, you know. Mushrooms, you're like, \"Oh,\nI feel like I can feel music.\" Like, cool, you know. You guys wanna watch\n\"March of the Penguins?\" - This is transformative. Did that change you? - I don't know. I think it definitely, I almost feel like it showed me the thing that I was scared the most of that it's all just cold, dark, nothing, and like brought me to the\nbasement of the universe. And I felt like the point\nof that was to come back to this place where there's all\nthis life and light and love and all this amazing\nstuff that we experience on a day-to-day basis and\ndon't take for granted. And so just like almost dying, this was like fully dying, you know. But the great part is is that, usually it's not that intense. This guy had overboiled the brew. He'd also, I saw the vine afterwards, most ayahuasca vines are\nlike as thick as your arm, this one was like as\nthick as a garbage can. It was like the oldest\nayahuasca vine you can imagine. And at like four in the morning, I like crawled over to my friend Chris, who's a tough New York City firefighter. We were holding each\nother, just like weeping, just like, \"Thank God we're back.\" Then we had to go looking for the shaman. Where the hell is this guy? He's gone. We found him in the morning and he was laying in the stream naked, like ET at the end when he\nis like laying, like in the. Yeah, he kicked his own ass with that brew and he retired after that. - [Lex] Oh shit. - So we really got, like, we had somebody turn the\ndial all the way up on us and so we got blasted. It's not supposed to be that bad. - But I think you're\nsomebody who's fearless and sort of diving into\nthose kinds of places. - I think I also retire from ayahuasca. I could be fearless with other things, but I think I'm good. - It sounds kind of, to me personally, kind of exciting. - Well, I think that you\nhave a severely fearless aspect to you. When you come up with\nsomething that intrigues you, like if somebody told you right now that you could go\nphysically into deep space, I feel like you would do it. - Yeah, I'd go to Mars, yeah. And some of it is... I don't even know if you have that. Some of that is more Goggins like, I want to see where my mind breaks by pushing it to tough places. There's a curiosity of exploring the mind, the limits of the mind. I feel like your--\n- That's not a cold plunge, that's like, you're not coming back. - [Lex] Right, and that's okay. - See. I do. I'm with you on that I\nlove seeing my limits, I absolutely love seeing my limits. I love getting my ass kicked, I love being shown how insignificant I am. But when it comes to something like that where you gotta push your chips in, it's gotta be something for me, it's gotta be a hill that I\nbelieve in before I die on it. Like to me, the promise of\nexploring space isn't enough. But like, even just the way you said, you're like, \"I'm going\nto Ukraine. Here I go.\" You know, there's a certain dedication to curiosity at any expense. And I think that that is\nsomething that maybe we share in different directions. - Something tells me with\nthose crocodiles outside I would've gotten eaten. Something tells me. There's something trying to\npreserve you in this world, I'm not sure exactly what that is. Somehow you keep surviving. What do you think is the\nmeaning of this whole thing? Why are we here? Like, do you ever ask\nyourself for that question? - I feel like that's every day. I feel like I'm someone\nthat lives with that a lot. And I think that it actually takes me away from the human world a little bit. I feel like I've always\nbeen a little bit apart because I think that other people do, you know, mushrooms and they go, wow, it really made me think\nabout how amazing it is here. And I feel like on a daily basis, I find myself where I'm like, I can't believe that\nany of this is possible. And that goes from how\ndelicious something tastes to being able to talk to\nsomeone in your family, or have a phone. There's times where I'm in\nthe Amazon and I miss home, and even just FaceTiming with someone, I go, this is possible? Like, people were rubbing sticks together to try and survive sabertooth\ntigers not that long ago and I'm over there like,\n\"Yo, mom, look at this.\" It's wild. Like, I'm in\na constant state of awe. I actually hope that this is a testing ground. And whether it's aliens\nor God or whatever it is, that this is something\ncrucially important. That would be nice, because\nit feels like it is. - Yeah, I hope that too, that the universe almost created\nus to see what's possible. And that I'd like to believe that beauty and good is possible. - And those are the things\nthat make me say that it's not, it's impossible for it\nto just mean nothing. And just like you said,\nthere could be life forms that we can't even understand. I'm very open to the idea that there's meanings that\nwe have no idea about. The few things I know or\nthe things that I love and some of the things that I love are being pushed to extinction\nso I try to protect them. That's my mission. But I'm saying like in terms\nof what are we doing here, I'm just always amazed at the simplest things, you know, that we can sit here\ndoing this exchanging. - Using our imagination\nto fill in the gaps, exchanging feelings, experiences, images. Yeah, it fills you with awe. And every once in a while you get a little glimpse of something, like a deeper meaning that might be there. And you don't really know what it is, but you get a glimpse\nand you keep searching. And then it's over\nbefore you know it, Paul. Hopefully for you, you\ngot many more years. - [Paul] That's dark, man. - You're an important,\nimportant and a beautiful man. Paul, thank you so much for talking today. Thank you for being who you are, for everything you're doing. I hope to see you again soon, many times and maybe one day soon in the jungle. - I hope that happens. Thank you, Lex. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Paul Rosalie. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with\nsome words from Jane Goodall. If we kill off the wild, then we're killing off\na part of our souls. Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time."
