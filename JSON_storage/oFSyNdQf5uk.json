      "text": "- You always know when you live in Gaza that it's only a matter of time\nbefore the next bombs drop. You know, if you're in Gaza, that you are waiting for your death. People dream about going out in the world and pursuing education. People dream about going out in the world and pursuing economic opportunity. In Gaza, your idea of\nopportunity is an opportunity to see the next year. That has been the case,\nand so when we talk about, you know, this not existing in a vacuum, if people only hear about\nGaza on October 7th, that is a major part of the\nproblem, and that is, again, part of the problem of our\nignorance and our apathy, right? Why is it that the plight\nof the people of Gaza is not brought up until an\nattack happens on Israel? - The following is a\nconversation with imam, Dr. Omar Suleiman, his\nsecond time on the podcast. He is a Palestinian American, a Muslim scholar, a civil rights leader, president of the Yaqeen\nInstitute for Islamic Research, and is one of the most\ninfluential Muslims in the world. Our previous conversation\nwas focused on Islam. This time, the focus was\non Gaza and Palestine. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description, and now, dear friends, here's Omar Suleiman."

      "section": "Oct 7",
      "text": "What did you think, feel, and pray for in the days that followed October 7th? - I think the first feeling was that there's going to be\na lot of death and destruction in Gaza as a result, right? We always kind of see this,\nwhere one Israeli casualty leads to hundreds of Palestinian\ncasualties, right? So, it's a pretty familiar\ncycle in some ways, where there are daily\ntransgressions against Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza, the checkpoints, the\naggression on Masjid Al-Aqsa, the settlements expanding, the\nstories of Palestinian death, and then you have rockets fired from Gaza, and that's when the\nWestern press catches up and starts to cover it. Israel responds with Hellfire missiles, white phosphorus bombs, and the casualties are\nwildly disproportionate. And so I think that, you\nknow, I wasn't surprised. I prayed for the people that I knew were going to bear\nthe brunt of this outbreak, but the outbreak was predictable. - You wrote a statement on October 9th. I was hoping to read it, if it's okay. - Yeah, go ahead. - \"Our Palestinian casualties\nare always your footnotes. The daily humiliation\nof occupation ignored. The aggression by settlers\nand soldiers alike on holy sites and souls. The annihilation of entire\nfamilies that follows. The devastation of whatever scraps remain in the open air prison of Gaza. Unsustainable and inhumane. So if you're waking up to a\nsudden interest in the region and want to know what's been happening, dig a bit deeper than two weeks and try to read beyond the headlines of a media that has been\ndehumanizing us for decades.\" - Again, this was not surprising,\nthis was very predictable. If you've been watching\nwhat's been unfolding before October 7th, 2021, Human Rights Watch\nputs out the report, \"Threshold reached, Israel\nis an apartheid state.\" Amnesty International 2022,\nthe crime of apartheid, showing how all of the\nlegal determinations of apartheid have been reached. The occupation's only\ngetting more aggressive. Shireen Abu Akleh, a\nPalestinian American journalist, is shot dead in 2022\nin front of the world. The United States says, initially, that if it is shown that\nIsrael was complicit or that Israel carried out the execution, then there will be consequences. Of course, once it was shown that Israel was indeed\nresponsible for the bullet that killed Shireen Abu Akleh, the United States did absolutely nothing. Shireen's funeral was attacked,\nthe pallbearers were beaten, her casket almost fell, and\nagain, the world is watching. The aggression against worshipers in Al-Aqsa is getting worse. You have the flag march,\nthe Jerusalem Flag March, where extremist settlers\nare let loose and wild on Palestinians by the thousands, chanting things like, \"Mohammed is dead. We're going to murder you,\nArabs,\" all with the protection of the state, with Israeli soldiers, and throughout this time, it's like, something bad is gonna happen,\nand then 2023 comes along. You had 13,000 settler units in 2023, a plan of 13,000 settler\nunits, the most in the history of the occupation, the most\nracist and extremist government, Israeli government that you have ever had, and people don't realize\nthat in 2023 alone, over 600 Palestinians\nhad already been killed. It just doesn't make Western headlines, and so if you wonder\nwhy the American public sees this so much differently\nthan the rest of the world, it's because American media shows the American public\nsomething so much different than what the rest of the world is shown. And so, this was a pressure cooker, this was going to explode,\nit is extremely predictable. You've given people absolutely no hope. And so, I think that, as\nwe're watching that, you know, it's important for us to actually\ninterrogate the ignorance that people have of\nthe Palestinian plight, the ignorance of the root\ncauses of this violence, the ignorance of the occupation, and also ask yourselves,\nyou know, why is it that Israel can violate every\nsingle international law on the books, have all\nthese determinations, and the United States keeps on issuing these inconsequential\nstatements while also, at the same time, funding\nthese aggressions? So it's like, \"Stop the settler violence,\" the United States will issue\nstatement after statement, \"Stop the settler violence,\nstop the incursions on Masjid Al-Aqsa, stop violating\nthe people in Jerusalem, stop trying to wipe out\nthe Palestinian people,\" stop openly saying, you know, that there is no two-state solution, that we will never allow\na Palestinian state to be established, but at the same time, here's your $3 billion check, and if the United Nations\nissues any sort of resolution against Israel, or if any\ninternational body tries to hold Israel accountable, the United States stands in\nthe way of any accountability. It's important for us to ask why, and so I always tell people,\nread beyond the headlines. Even now, with the backdrop of a genocide, over 30,000 people have been killed, if you open the front page of most American mainstream sites, you will see stories about the hostages, the Israeli hostages, you will see stories about October 7th, but\nOctober 8th is missing, October 9th is missing,\nOctober 10th is missing, a hundred days of genocide are missing. And you'll barely have a story that shows up every once\nin a while that, you know, is still very much so controlled by the Israeli propaganda machine because while Israel kills\nPalestinian journalists, it also makes sure that\nAmerican journalists are only able to tell a certain story. They're only able to see Gaza\nfrom a certain perspective, they're only able to speak about Gaza from a certain perspective,\nand this is well-documented, that they have to review\ntheir media tapes with Israel before they can publicize them, and so this is state\npropaganda at this point. The mainstream media and\nthe United States government are in lockstep, telling\na very skewed story, and that is leading to a\ngreater sense of frustration, and I think the American\npublic has been wronged as well by not knowing what's happening. - So you mentioned settlements. So, to you, this is bigger\nthan Gaza, it is the West Bank, it is the the Palestinian people, broadly. - Absolutely, you can't\ndisconnect Gaza from Palestine. You can't disconnect the\nWest Bank from Palestine. You can't disconnect\nJerusalem from Palestine, and you can't disconnect\nthe very human story from the political plight. You interviewed Mohammed\nEl-Kurd, you met him. What did the world do\nwhen it saw the images of the Kurd household\nbeing taken over by a guy from Brooklyn or Long\nIsland who just shows up and lays claim to their home? What did the world do when American settlers suddenly\ndecided they could walk into historic Palestinian homes and throw people out of their homes? What did the world do? And so, yes, this is\nvery much so connected to the broader issue of\nPalestinian existence. If you realize here,\nwe are erased in peace, and we are erased in war. In peace, it's the Abraham Accords, agreements between Israel\nand its Arab neighbors, which is supposedly to solve\nthe Palestinian problem. The Palestinians are\nabsent from their own fate, from discussions about their own fate. In war, it's the Israel-Hamas\nWar, it's Israel and Gaza. Where are the Palestinian people, the millions of Palestinian people, that have either been\nremoved from their land or are being tormented on their land? Where are they in this discussion?"

      "section": "Palestinian diaspora",
      "text": "- What are the Palestinians\nin the diaspora feeling? - I think deeply frustrated. A great sense of anger, sadness. Every single Palestinian\nright now knows someone that's been killed. Every single Palestinian\nis a part of a story of displacement or destruction. Every single Palestinian has a relative that's either missing\na limb or a loved one. Every single Palestinian\nin the world is traumatized by this, and in some ways,\nbeing outside of Palestine, being away from it all, hurts even more because you see your people\nbeing killed and starved and brutalized and slaughtered, and you can't do anything about it. And the people around you are\njustifying that slaughter. If you turn on a TV, or if you\nopen a mainstream news site, these sites are justifying your slaughter. And people are being killed over there because they look like me, because they're Palestinian\nlike I'm Palestinian, and so we're watching this\nin diaspora with agony. We can't go, we can't heal our loved ones, we can't comfort the\npeople that are there. I recently spoke to a doctor\nwho's lost 75 relatives, 75 relatives in Gaza, and\nhe's a medical doctor, and all he wants to do is get in there and just use his medical\nexpertise to help his people, and he can't, and so, we're\nwatching it from afar, but our hearts are there. They are in the buildings\nthat are being destroyed, they're in the hospitals\nthat are being bombed, they are there, and they\nare with the people. - You're somebody who's always rushed into the midst of a crisis. So what does it feel\nlike on a personal level to not be able to do that\nhere, to go to Gaza to help? - Yeah, it's really hard. I mean, when any group\nof people are killed, my instinct, and I think a lot of people, is to go there to help,\nwhether it's a natural disaster or especially after an incident of terror, wherever it is, right? It's rush there and do\nthe best that you can to help people get through it. So it's been extremely hard\nto watch this from afar and feel like I can't\ndo anything about it, and so that's why, instead,\nI think that most of us are driven to continue to be\nthe voice of the voiceless. You know, I always say that\nif they've made them faceless, they can't make us voiceless. They have reduced our casualties\nin Palestine to a number. The number is hundreds a\nday, over 30,000 people. We're averaging 10,000 people a month. The fact that they've been\nturned into faceless numbers with no stories, with no humanity, makes it that much more important for us to tell their stories here,\nand to remind the world that you've lost your humanity\nif you can watch this unfold and not even have the decency\nto call for a ceasefire. I mean, that's the, that's\nwhere we've reached, that's how low it is right now. Calling for a ceasefire\nhas now become radical. So we have to remind the\nworld that if you're okay with the demolition of\nan entire town or a city or whatever it is that you wanna call Gaza 'cause it wasn't always the Gaza Strip, but if you're okay with this, and you're okay with this\ncasualty count every single day, it's not just them who are being killed, it's your hearts that are dying. And I think that when I look back to Dr. Martin Luther King\nJr., and I mentioned this, he wrote about Vietnam. He said that if America was to succumb to its spiritual death, the\nautopsy would read Vietnam. I would say that it would read Gaza now."

      "section": "Wael Al-Dahdouh",
      "text": "- Speaking of the people,\nthe faces, the voices, one of the people you've talked\nabout, you've posted about, you've written about is Wael Al-Dahdouh, him being hospitalized. He's a Palestinian journalist\nand the bureau chief of Al Jazeera in Gaza City. What can you tell me about this man? - If Wael Al-Dahdouh wasn't Palestinian, he'd be on the cover of\nTime Magazine right now. He would be the most celebrated\njournalist in the world. Wael Al-Dahdouh is from Gaza. He has been in Israeli prisons, he has been under Israeli airstrikes, he has seen the worst of the occupation before he's seen the worst\nof the genocide while on TV. I mean, and this is insane\nwhen you think about it. We have over a hundred\njournalists now, right? That's more than any conflict in history that have been killed, and\nthere is sufficient evidence by international watchdogs\nthat this is intentional, that journalists have\nbeen killed intentionally, but then their families,\nWael was reporting on TV when an airstrike hits his wife,\ntwo kids, and a grandchild. He goes to the scene, and he said this, \"You know, you never\nexpect as a journalist to be the subject of the story.\" Suddenly, the camera's on him\nmourning over his dead wife and kids and grandkid, and\nhe's saying, he even says it in Arabic, he says, \"They're\ntaking it out on our children. They're taking it out on our children.\" You know, I've heard\nthis from multiple people that have had relatives targeted that, \"I wish it was me instead.\" He gets back on camera the same day because he feels a\nresponsibility to continue to cover the lives of the people of Gaza. He understands that his story,\nas devastating as it is, is not unique in regards\nto the people of Gaza, that there are many people whose families have been\nkilled in airstrikes. All two million people have\nbeen traumatized in some way. And so he gets back on\ncamera, tells the story again, and then he is targeted himself. His arm struck, his\ncameraman, Samer Abudaqa, dies in front of him. He bleeds out, Wael watches\nhim bleed out for hours, and while any aid workers try\nto reach them in the building that they were in, snipers\nwould shoot all of those that were rushing to Samer,\nso he watches his cameraman and one of his best\nfriends bleed out to death. Wael goes to the hospital,\nhis arm is wrapped up, gets treatment, he's back\non camera the next day. A few weeks later, another\nchild is killed, again, with his friend in a car, so\nthis was a targeted airstrike. His son is driving, and\nhis son and his best friend are hit in an airstrike. Wael leads the funeral prayer,\nis back on camera again and speaks with such dignity,\nwith such compassion. You know, one of the things\nthat always gets to me as a Palestinian, right,\nand as a Muslim too, is that we are portrayed to\nbe these beasts and savages. Tell me a man that would be put through what Wael was put through and\nstill stand on that pulpit and in front of the\nworld with such dignity, with such grace, continues\nto tell the story. Wael has become a hero to many of us, and he would be a hero in a world that wasn't anti-Palestinian,\nand unfortunately, Wael has not only lost his family, he's not only lost much\nof his own existence, but Wael is part of the\ngreater story of erasure. So even though he's telling the\nstory of the people of Gaza, and he is the story of the people of Gaza, most people will never\nlearn about Wael Al-Dahdouh. - You have posted videos and\nwritten about what is happening in Gaza since October 7th. What has been happening\nthere, the individual stories and the broader impact on\nthe two million people there. - Gaza been described as the world's largest\nopen-air prison, unemployment, blockaded from all directions, no airport, regular added restrictions placed even on their ability to fish. So every aspect of Gazan life\nhas been under occupation. I would argue that it's an injustice to even call it an open-air prison because inmates are not\nbombed in prisons routinely by the most sophisticated\nweapons in the world. Regular bombardment of\nGaza, every single person in Gaza has lived through\nmultiple rounds of bombardment. It is deeply distressing. You know, I remember, in 2021, there was an image that\nI will never forget of children having to go back to school after the bombardment of 2021. And next to them, they\nwould have the empty chairs and the posters of the child\nthat used to sit in that chair. I think what encapsulates it most for me, an image that I grew up with was the image of Mohammed al-Durrah, who\nwas in his father's lap over 20 years ago, and\nhis father was begging for Israel to spare his child, and Mohammed was murdered in his lap. And you know what\nhappened this last round? His other kids were murdered. So Mohammed's brothers were murdered, and his father's been on the run. Every single person in Gaza\nhas witnessed multiple wars, has witnessed the greatest\nsuffocation of occupation, has even had their diets restricted, and has suffered under\nIsrael state policy, which is called \"mowing the lawn.\" And everyone should look this up. This is what Israeli ministers refer to as routine bombardment of\nGaza, \"mowing the lawn,\" which shows you that before\nthey called us animals, they considered us insects. And unfortunately, the casualty counts get higher and higher every time, and people become more and more desperate, more and more helpless. Gaza has been, unfortunately,\nthe worst manifestation of anti-Palestinian bigotry. It's already, I mean,\n60% of the population is a refugee population. What that means, and people\ndo need to understand this, is that people move to\nGaza from other parts of occupied territory to find refuge, and were practically living\non top of each other. There are people that\nare in the Gaza Strip that know that they had homes right beyond that apartheid wall, and those homes were stolen from them, and they can't even enter\nthat territory anymore. And they know that on the\nother side of that wall, there's life, on the\nother side of that wall, there's opportunity, on the\nother side of that wall, you have a passport, you have an airport, you have the ability to travel, you have the ability to export and import. You can dream, but behind that wall, you are to live until the next airstrike, you are to live until\nIsrael mows the lawn again and hope that you're\nnot part of the grass. That's what Gaza has\nbeen all of these years. - So pragmatically and psychologically, it's very difficult to flourish when you're just waiting\nfor more bombardment. - 'Cause you know that\nit's around the corner. You always know, when you live in Gaza, that it's only a matter of time\nbefore the next bombs drop. You know, if you're in Gaza, that you are waiting for your death. People dream about going out in the world and pursuing education. People dream about going out in the world and pursuing economic opportunity. In Gaza, your idea of opportunity is an opportunity to see the next year. That has been the case. And so when we talk about, you know, this not existing in a vacuum, if people only hear about\nGaza on October 7th, that is a major part of the problem. And that is, again, part of the problem of our ignorance and our apathy, right? Why is it that the plight\nof the people of Gaza is not brought up until an\nattack happens on Israel? - I've gotten a chance to\nwitness a destroyed school in Ukraine. That's something that is\nreally difficult to see. - You have over a hundred\ndestroyed mosques. Every university in Gaza\nhas been demolished. We're seeing TikTok videos\nof Israeli soldiers laughing and singing as they press a button, and we see the demolition of every single university in Gaza. Schools have been reduced to rubble. There's a cultural genocide as well. And I want you to think about\nwhat you saw in Ukraine. Look, imagine coming\nback to school in Gaza, in some destroyed building. You're missing legs, you're missing arms, you have white phosphorus burns. Have you ever seen what white\nphosphorus does to a person? There's a reason why it's a war crime. You have white phosphorus\nburns, your mom's dead, your dad's dead, all of your\nuncles and aunts are dead, all of your siblings are dead. Somehow you got pulled out of the rubble. You know, in my own family,\nmy father's in-laws, my father remarried after\nmy mother passed away, and they're in Gaza. All of them were killed in an airstrike except for an elderly aunt who somehow made it out\nof the rubble a day later. If you're a child that's been\npulled out of the rubble, what are you gonna grow up with? I mean, what are you supposed to feel? What are you supposed to think? And then you have, you\nknow, racist commentators that say they could have\nturned that into a Singapore. You know, the Palestinians are the authors of their own destruction\nbecause if they wanted to, they could have turned this\ninto a place of prosperity, but they keep on bringing\ndestruction upon themselves. So at the root of this\nis a bigotry, and again, this idea that Palestinians\nare savages, they're animals, and the only way to deal with them is to continuously mow the lawn while simultaneously\nexpanding the occupation and erasing anything that\nwas ever called Palestine and any human being that was\never called a Palestinian. - So those kids growing\nup in Gaza now, to you, they have almost no choice\nbut to have hatred for Israel? - It's human. I mean, look, any child\nthat is under that type of oppression is going\nto hate their oppressor. I don't care who you are,\nI don't care what you are, but here's my problem with\nhow that gets brought up. You're talking about the future\nof the security of Israel. Even some people that speak about it, seemingly from a place\nof being well-meaning, that say the only way that\nIsrael can have its security is to stop killing Palestinians. And so the future of Israel depends upon Palestinians not\nhating Israel so much. And so we've gotta stop\ntormenting these people so that they don't grow\nup to want to torment us. You've already decided then whose life is worth more than the other. And so, instead of\ntalking about the future of Israeli lives, why don't\nyou talk about the present of Palestinian lives? Instead of talking about\nwhether or not your state will be secure in the future, talk to me about why you're killing children now. Two-thirds of the 30,000\ncivilians are women and children. And so, we can't talk\nabout what these children are going to grow up with. We should talk about whether\nor not these children are going to grow up in the first place. And that should be what dominates\nour conscience right now and what drives our policies and what drives our emotions right now. - So when I had a conversation\nwith Elon Musk, he suggested that what Israel should do is\nconspicuous acts of kindness. So do as much positive\nthings in Gaza as possible, on a basic individual human level and at a policy level, at every level. What do you think about that? - I mean, you don't pass out\ncandy in a concentration camp, you end the occupation. And so there has to be a solution that is beyond merely acts of kindness. At the end of the day, if\nyou're occupying a people, you have to remove that occupation. Apartheid is not dealt\nwith by acts of kindness on the part of the occupying power. Apartheid is dealt with\nby ending apartheid. And so there has to be a\nlevel of accountability. It's not just acts of kindness, it's not just treating the\npeople with more dignity. It's giving them the ability\nto pursue their own dignity. There's a reason why it's called Palestinian self-determination. The United States likes to use it in all of its inconsequential statements, that we need Palestinian\nself-determination too, but the United States also\nvoted against 138 states in the United Nations to allow for Palestinian self-determination. Self-determination means I\nget to pursue my own course of worth, I get to\npursue my own happiness, I don't have to depend on the\nbenevolence of my occupier. And when my occupier feels like, you know, throwing me a few more\ncrumbs, it has to end. There has to be a point\nnow where the world says, \"This is not sustainable.\" It's not just about ending\nthe present genocide. A ceasefire is the bare minimum. I think any decent human being would be calling for\na ceasefire right now, but at some point, you cease occupation, you cease apartheid because\nwhat led to the ability of Israel to carry out a genocide\nwithout any accountability was that the global arena\nhas permitted it to do so, largely due to American\nobstruction of justice."

      "section": "Violence",
      "text": "- Is violence an effective\nmethod of resistance? - So, the framework that I would propose is that Dr. King mentioned\nthat peace is not the absence of violence, it's the presence of justice. And so occupation and\napartheid are violent, even in their most\nbenevolent manifestations. The default of occupation\nis that it is unjustified. The default of apartheid\nis that it is unjustified, and it must be dealt with. The default of resistance\nto occupation and apartheid is that it is justified, but\nthere can be transgressions even in resisting occupation\nand apartheid, right? And I come to this from\nan Islamic perspective. My moral framework is Islam. The Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, was outraged when he saw a\nwoman or a child that was dead from the other side, the\nside of his persecutors. And so, yes, you know, we\nhave a saying, as Muslims, that they are not our teachers. Our oppressors are not our teachers, but the concept of\nresistance to occupation, it is morally justified, it is justified by international law. Any occupied people have the\nright to defend themselves. We talk about Israel's\nright to defend itself. Israel is the occupier. Any occupied people, by\ninternational law, have the right to defend themselves, and\nany occupation is unjustified and illegal, and so\nthat's where I start from, that's the point that I come to this with. I think that the problem\nis, is that the Palestinians are told, \"Find better ways to resist,\" and then they are demonized when they try to find\nany other way to resist. You know, if you go back a few years ago, you had the Great Return March. People in Gaza marched to the wall in what was one of the\nmost inspiring protests or demonstrations that I had ever seen. Marched to the wall, non-violent protest, and snipers took out their legs. AP actually documented that\nIsraeli snipers had knee counts, where you had an Israeli\nsoldier that would say, \"I took out 45 knees.\" They actually had to register\na scroll of knee counts, and so you have all these kids in Gaza walking around without legs now because they were targeted by snipers when they marched to the wall. We're told to find methods\nof non-violent resistance, but when we boycott, when we\nlaunched, you know, boycotts around the world in response\nto this transgression, in response to this ongoing oppression that the world powers have\nshown either the inability or the unwillingness to rein in, we're told that that's anti-Semitic, even though it is based on\nthe South African method of bringing an end to the\napartheid regime there. So don't respond with violence,\ndon't respond non-violently, don't protest, don't\ntry to use people power in the face of global impotence\nat the political level. Instead, let's just keep talking about the two-state solution, and while talking about\nthe two-state solution, if you were to look at a map, under every single Israeli\nregime, conservative or liberal, whatever it is, the\nsettlements have expanded, more Palestinian land has disappeared, more Palestinians have been dispossessed, more Palestinians have been killed. And so we have these little pieces of land that keep on shrinking, and\nJerusalem keeps disappearing, and there's aggression, whether Palestinians are resisting or not, but then we're told, \"Why can't you people just pursue peace? Why can't you just\nbelieve in a better way?\" All along, we're hearing Israeli ministers become far more radical and\nopen about their intentions to wipe us off the face of the earth. And that is actually their policy. It's not just slogans,\nit's not fringe elements. Actual Israeli ministers, starting from the prime minister himself, who has executed a policy of the removal of all Palestinian lands\nand Palestinian lives. And then we're told, \"Peace,\npeace, peace, peace.\" And it is awfully ugly when\nyou use the language of peace to suffocate the work of justice. You know, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., one of his early sermons was\nsomething along the lines of when peace is obnoxious,\nwhen peace is obnoxious. It was in the 1950s, around\nthe Montgomery Bus Boycott, and he talked about how this obsession with the language of peace is usually used to try to keep people in status quo and make them complacent with\ntheir miserable situation. That has been the story\nof the Palestinian people, that they've been told that\nif you do things differently, then you will find peace, but everything the\nPalestinians have tried, inside and outside, has\nbeen met with repression, the most violent forms of\nit there in Gaza and beyond. And so, look, I start from the place of wanting to see peace. I want to see a situation in which no innocent\npeople lose their lives, but we have to analyze the situation with some justice, with some fairness. What would any group of\npeople do in this situation? That doesn't mean that you hope for hell, that means that you analyze\nthe existing circumstances of hell, which was life in\nGaza even before October 7th. - That said, you did talk about\nWael Al-Dahdouh and dignity, and you mentioned transgressions. So there is places where\nviolence can go too far. - Absolutely, so violence,\nagain, the point is, is that you ask yourself\nwhy we've been silent about the violence all of this time. And you know what? When people say, \"Well, what about this? Well, what about that?\" My response is this. What I would love to see is\neffective international bodies of justice being able\nto rein in any party, that has committed an act of aggression or committed an act of injustice,\nand hold them accountable. Any reasonable human being\nwould say, \"Yeah, you know what? There should be effective\ninternational bodies that can rein in parties that can't be reined in domestically, that could stop the violence, that could assign blame properly, and then have methods of accountability.\" The problem is, is that Israel\nhas been made invincible in the international arena\nbecause of the United States. And then we wonder why there's such a rise in global anti-American sentiment. It's not because of American freedom, it's because America is\ndirectly participating. The United States government\nis directly participating in the worst genocide\nthat we have ever seen in our lives, right? Playing out onscreen, you\nknow, on social media, and we can't do anything about it. So I think that the point is, is that we need those\ninternational bodies, we need methods of\neffective accountability. And I would love to see\nblame properly assigned and anyone that kills\nany innocent human being taken to account, anyone that is guilty of a\nwar crime taken to account. We have to ask ourselves, why\nis it that Israel has violated over 63 United Nations resolutions, has expanded its occupation, has killed over 600\nPalestinians before October 7th, why is it that Israel\ncannot be held accountable? And so when you talk about, you know, words that get thrown around,\nyou know, that are used to justify violence against\nmore innocent people. You know, when I'm asked about terrorism, is it only terrorism if\nit's a non-state actor? If someone's sitting inside\na room, you know, of suits and can press a button and\nterrorize thousands of people and murder innocent people\nwith no consequences, how is that not terrorism? So if terrorism is only to be\nassigned to non-state actors, then it's a word without function. In fact, it's a word that\njustifies more terror that is then rained upon\ninnocent populations. We have to have more consistency. Children should not be killed. Non-combatants should not be targeted. We can all agree upon that. Why aren't there proper\ninvestigative bodies and then proper international\nbodies of accountability then that can execute their findings in a way that makes the\nworld a better place, in a way that actually\nbrings about more peace? And so, you know, I think this\nis where we're at right now, and this is the frustration,\nand this is the place that the Palestinians have been left. - To you, violence becomes terrorism when women and children,\nnon-combatants, are killed, no matter who is doing the killing. - Absolutely, absolutely. - In America, for you,\nfor other Palestinians, other Muslims in your community, what has all of this been like? - It feels like there's a\nreturn to some of the days after 9/11, the dehumanization, the feeling of complete\ndisregard for our humanity at the level of government,\nat the level of media, feeling of an increase in surveillance, the feeling in an increase in bigotry. People are losing their jobs,\nand people are being berated on campuses, in grocery stores,\nand people are being killed. You know, I went to the\nfuneral of a six-year-old boy who was killed directly due to\nanti-Palestinian propaganda. And so I think that a lot\nof us are feeling a return to that, but we also refuse\nto be cornered into a position where we are told to perpetually\ncondemn acts of violence and not speak about the violence that's committed against\nus here or abroad. - Can you tell the story of\nthis boy, Wadea al-Fayoume? He's a six-year-old\nPalestinian American boy who was stabbed 26 times in his home in Plainfield Township, Illinois. It was found to be a hate crime\nmotivated by Islamophobia. And the attacker said,\n\"You Muslims must die.\" - So before Wadea was killed, Wadea was killed on a Saturday. It was the immediate\nSaturday after October 7th. I remember, on Friday,\nmedia starts to reach out to every imam in the\ncountry, every Muslim leader in the country, and say,\n\"What are you gonna do about this global day of Jihad? What are you gonna do about\nthe global day of Jihad?\" It's like, \"What are you talking about?\" It's like, \"Well, Hamas has called for a global day of Jihad, so\nhow are you gonna stop Muslims from attacking people,\" right? So it's Friday, and I'm like, \"Well, this is the first\nI'm hearing from you.\" And I remember responding\nto a local reporter. Most people I just ignored. I responded to a local reporter. I said, \"I've got people in my community that have already lost 10,\n15 relatives at that point. Now it's 20, 30, and\nyou haven't said a word, and now you're reaching out to me about the potential violence\nof Muslims in America? This is great, this is\njust like 9/11, right?\" What are you gonna do to\nrestrain you angry Muslims from responding to\nwhat's happening overseas and responding to the call\nof a global day of Jihad? Guess what? That night, this man\ntakes out a military knife and attacks a six-year-old boy, a six-year-old Palestinian boy. By the way, it gets worse the\nmore details that you know. And I recently had a chance\nto go and speak to his mom 'cause she was in the\nhospital and I was there for the funeral, so I\nhad a chance to visit her not too long ago. - And she was attacked also. - She was attacked first. It was actually their landlord. So Hanan, the mother,\nwas at home with Wadea, six-year-old boy. Landlord comes in, and\nwith absolutely no emotion, just charges at her, starts with her. She was able to fight him\noff, stabbed her, initially, seven or eight times with\na military-grade knife. She fought him off, escaped to call 911, and while she is calling\n911, she hears Wadea. Wadea ran up to the man,\ncalling him Uncle Joe because the landlord, prior to\nthat, had been kind to them. Used to give Wadea toys. Wadea had an infectious, beautiful smile. Every picture you see of that kid, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful smile. And so Wadea runs up to\nhim, says, \"Uncle Joe.\" He runs up to him to give him a hug even though he's carrying\na military-great knife with blood on it 'cause\nWadea doesn't believe that harm can come to him from that man. And Hanan didn't think that he\nwould do anything to her kid, even in that fit of rage. The last thing that she\nsays she heard was, \"Oh no.\" You know Wadea says, \"Oh no.\" And then he starts to stab him 26 times, says, \"You Muslims must die.\" Usually, in a scene like\nthat, police are hesitant to classify something as a hate crime. It was classified as a hate\ncrime the very same day. The thing is, is that who's\ncomplicit in that hate crime? What filled that man's\nhead for him to believe that he was doing an act of good by murdering a six-year-old\nPalestinian boy? And in reality, Uncle Joe was motivated by President Joe Biden, who\nrepeated a debunked report that there were 40\nbeheaded Israeli babies. And he said, \"I saw 40\nbeheaded Israeli babies.\" The White House walked it back afterwards in a statement\nthat no one reads because it was factually\nfalse, but Uncle Joe heard it and had been binge-watching media about these violent\nPalestinians, and suddenly, the propaganda overcame his own humanity and what he knew of that family, and he went in and ruined their lives. And you know, now, you\nknow, just like any mom, you know, she hasn't moved a thing. His bike is still in\nthe same place it was. Toys are still in the same place. She's left with this great\nvoid, this great emptiness. If that was the only\ncrime, it would be enough to wake this country up and say, \"Oh no, this is not where we need to go.\" Oh no, right? The last thing she heard\nhim say was, \"Oh no.\" If that was it, and I\ngot the news, by the way, when I was, ironically, at a protest, we were protesting on\nSaturday, Downtown Dallas. And I started getting all these texts about what happened in Chicago. Oh no, right? Like, no Muslims attacked anyone. The media was in a frenzy\nover the global day of Jihad. I got called by national news outlets and local news outlets, \"What\nare you gonna do about Muslims that are gonna turn into monsters and start killing people in the streets?\" Next thing we know, we have a dead six-year-old\nPalestinian boy. Went to his funeral,\nand that kind of speaks to the proximity part of things. Yeah, it felt like stepping\ninto Gaza, right, for a moment. It didn't feel like America,\ndidn't feel like America. It felt like stepping into Gaza. His casket was wrapped\nin a Palestinian flag. There was not just sadness at his funeral, but a deep sense of anger. At the funeral, some of his\nfamily members shouted out, \"Joe Biden, you did this,\nJoe Biden, you did this.\" And, you know, I remember, the next day, it was right after the funeral,\nlooking at the front page of CNN, and the story of Wadea was buried in the last section, and it was right over all\nthese meaningless ads. And I thought to myself, \"That's it.\" Like if this was an\nArab man, let's be real, let's be honest here, if this\nwas a Palestinian landlord that stabbed a six-year-old\nJewish boy to death, this would have gotten more attention. It would've been the\nfront page of the news, and rightfully so,\npeople would have grieved over the insanity of stabbing\na six-year-old boy 26 times. Wadea became an afterthought\nthe very next day. And so it's an extension of the bigotry, an extension of the racism, and there's so much\nthat happens after that. There's the terrible stabbing of a Detroit synagogue\npresident, Samantha Woll, and it's horrible. She was stabbed in her driveway. Immediately, front page\nof all the news outlets, immediately, it's the main\nnews story, and immediately, the implications are,\n\"There go the Muslims, the Palestinians have lost their minds. The Muslims have, they are who\nwe thought they were,\" right? That's what it is, they are\nwho we thought they were. They went and they stabbed\na synagogue president. It turned out it wasn't a hate crime, although it was an awful crime. It turned out it wasn't a hate crime. Wadea is an afterthought. I had people reach out to me afterwards, expressing condolences,\nand I responded to them, those who have justified\nthe genocide in Gaza, but that were somehow offering\ncondolences for Wadea, privately, of course. You know, by the way, if a Muslim would've committed that crime, every single Muslim\nleader would've had press in front of their door\nto condemn that crime. We would've all been made complicit. Had people reach out to me, say, \"I'm sorry about what happened\nwith Wadea, it's terrible. You know, I saw you at the\nfuneral, praying for you.\" My response was, \"What's the difference between Wadea and a boy in Gaza? What's the difference\nbetween me and Wadea?\" I'm a Palestinian child. My parents made it out of Palestine. I was born in this country. If I didn't have the\nopportunity to grow up here and to become the person that I became, you would've been justifying\nmy murder right now. You would've been okay with my genocide. You would've been giving\nthe talking points to the press to erase\nme, but you feel sorry because Wadea was killed? And I think this is when we say that anti-Palestinian\nbigotry is an extension of Islamophobia. If a mosque gets targeted here, people rightfully rush\nto protect that mosque, and say, \"This is horrible,\nand it shouldn't happen.\" But when you have an Israeli\nsoldier bombing a mosque and laughing like a maniac on video, and it's going viral on TikTok, and there is no way to rein that in, and you don't have a word\nof condemnation about it, in fact, you are standing\nin the way of a ceasefire, then you're a hypocrite. There's no way around\nit, you are a hypocrite. What's the difference\nbetween a mosque here and a mosque there? What's the difference between\na Palestinian life here and a Palestinian life there? If you're okay with me\nbeing murdered there, don't say that you care\nabout my life here. And so that hypocrisy has been laid bare. We have said multiple times, \"Masks are falling, masks are falling.\" People that we thought were decent people somehow have found it in\nthemselves to justify a genocide. There is no shortage, at\nthis point, of videos. And again, when you, you know,\nI could have made the excuse for you maybe in the\nfirst few weeks, you know, that you hadn't seen enough, but with all social media\nsuppression across all platforms, there isn't a single platform that hasn't suppressed Palestinian voices, with all that suppression,\nthere are enough videos at this point of children whose\nheads have been blown off, of children walking around without limbs, of parents carrying their kids in bags, not body bags, I mean grocery bags 'cause they don't even have\nbody bags, and screaming out and saying, \"Why are you doing this to me? Make it stop.\" And you come back and\nyou tell that person, \"It's Hamas' fault.\" Where's your humanity? Where is your sense of decency? Isn't that the logic of\nthe so-called terrorism that you condemn? Yeah, well, you can wipe\nout entire populations. You should have talked to Hamas. It's Hamas' fault. All the kids in the West Bank\nall like, where does this end? So what's your, what are your\nmoral boundaries here, right? So if that's the logic\nthat you're okay with, then, in that case, when there's\na mass shooter in a school in the United States, just\nbomb the whole school. In fact, bomb the whole town if you can't find the\nmass shooter, you know? Where does this end for you, right? And so when I say people\nhave lost their humanity, they're killing us overseas,\nbut their hearts are dying. People have lost their humanity. They've lost any sense of morality and their moral boundaries,\nand being there, and, I mean, participating in\nthis funeral, it was anger. I'm not used to that,\nI'm not used to that. You know, I'm an imam, I pastor to people. I went to Christchurch, and that was the worst\nI'd ever seen before, where 50 Muslims were killed\nby a white supremacist. And he murdered them\nwith such callousness, and I remember being at those funerals, and yeah, I mean there was anger, but it was just profound sadness because at least the rest of\nthe world could all come out in one voice and say, \"That's wrong.\" Now most of the world sees\nwhat's happening in Gaza and says, \"This is disgusting.\" Most of the world sees this\nand says, \"This is a genocide.\" But we happen to live in this bubble here, where we're constantly being\ntold we did this to ourselves. And that's the same logic that led to our initial expulsion, 1948. What was the crime of\nthose 700,000 Palestinians that were driven out\nof their home in 1948? What did they do? They didn't do, they did\nnot commit the Holocaust, they didn't have a mass\nmurder of Jews at their hands. What did they do? What crime were they paying for? And so it's been the consistent theme. This is the story of our\npeople, not since October 7th. This is the story of our\npeople for the last 75 years."

      "section": "Biden and Trump",
      "text": "- There is a deep geopolitical connection between the United States\nand that part of the world. What is the role of US\npoliticians in all of this? - You know, James Baldwin wrote\nabout how Israel was created as an extension of United States policy to be a colonial entity at\nthe gates of the Middle East. And to function essentially\nas a military base out there and as a means of extending\nits policy, you know, throughout the Middle East,\nand it has functioned as such. The United States is not\nan honest peace broker. It never has been an honest peace broker. The United States has never\nshown any meaningful inclination towards peace, has guarded\nand protected Israel from international accountability, has made Israel invincible. The United States is not just responsible at the governmental\nlevel for the genocide, it's responsible for\nletting it get to this point in the first place. We have funded that arsenal. We've given them the most\nsophisticated weapons in the world to test on the most desperate\npopulation in the world. We've given them the weapons. It's been bipartisan. We have issued, at most,\ninconsequential statements of condemnation, but at the same time, stopped any international body of law from actually holding it accountable. So the United States, at\nthis point, unfortunately, has rightfully lost all credibility. It should remove itself from this because it is not an honest peace broker. I think Americans are probably\nsick of us paying for wars in general. I think Americans are probably sick of our tax dollars going\nto funding a genocide. While we have a rise of homelessness and income disparity here\nin the United States, I think that Americans\nprobably don't like that. We're making ourselves so\ndeeply unpopular in the world because of Israel's actions. So in the immediate\nmoment, make this stop. The United States could\nhave had a ceasefire a long time ago. The United States could have\nended this genocide right away. The reason why this is continuing is because of US foreign\npolicy, and in the process of Joe Biden talking\nabout managing this crisis and talking about making things better, there have only been more bills that have come out of Congress. In fact, he's bypassed\nCongress to fund the arsenal, to keep replenishing the arsenal. Stop paying for weapons, stop paying for someone else's war crimes, stop protecting another country as it commits these war crimes. And if you can't be an\nhonest peace broker, get out of the process. - So there's money that you\njust mentioned and bills, and then there's rhetoric,\nwhich you also criticized, that he spoke about the beheaded babies and things of that nature. So where has Joe Biden fallen short? - Yeah, we need another podcast. That's gonna take a few hours to talk about where Joe Biden has failed. For one, the first time he seemed to find the word Palestinian\nin his vocabulary was when he accused the Palestinians of lying about the death toll in Gaza, and then that turned out to also be false. In fact, the numbers that were coming out of the Gaza Health Ministry, according to multiple\ninternational bodies, have been under-reporting\nPalestinian casualty counts. Israeli intelligence has\nsaid that the civilian count or the death toll is actually higher than what's been coming out\nof the Gaza Health Ministry, so he's failed on that front. He has failed to speak\nto Palestinian humanity. He has spoken with deep\npassion and concern, as has Antony Blinken, about, you know, the devastation in Israel and the way that people\nare feeling in Israel, and has shown nothing of that\nsort towards Palestinians. We don't want the rhetoric, we really don't want the rhetoric. You know, when people say,\n\"Call for a ceasefire,\" the United States has had an opportunity and has an opportunity to really walk back and reflect on its entire\npolicy towards Israel-Palestine. This is a moment of reflection. This is a moment of restoration\nif you want it to be, right? And to think about what we've\nenabled in the first place. He's shown absolutely no real empathy. And I think that he is\nunder great delusion in thinking that the Muslim community or people of conscience\nare gonna forgive this, are gonna forget this come November. You can't tell us that. Well, at least I don't\nhave the Trump Muslim ban while also carrying out a\ngenocide primarily against Muslims and think that the Muslims\nare still gonna vote for you. And so we will make him\nhear us at the polls, and any politician, for\nCongress or otherwise, that has not called for a ceasefire, that has been a part\nof this dehumanization, we will make sure that\nwe see support for them in any way as a community. It's only right. - So Biden has lost or is losing\nthe hearts and the support of the Muslim, Palestinian people and the Muslim people in America. - I don't know if he ever had the hearts of the Muslim community,\nto be honest with you. I mean, I personally was\nnever a Joe Biden fan. I think a lot of people felt the same. You know, this country\nunfortunately leads to the, the way that our political system is built is that you're always\nvoting for the lesser of the two evils. That's always the way that it is. It's analyzing which evil is lesser, right?\n- Yeah. - And when people say, \"If\nyou vote for Donald Trump,\" and I'm not planning to vote\nfor Donald Trump either, but if you don't vote\nfor Joe Biden, right, if you don't vote for Joe Biden, right, then you are destroying democracy. I'm like, a democracy\nthat's given us a choice between Donald Trump and Joe Biden is already a failed democracy. And so, he never had the hearts and minds of the Muslim community. People always saw past his rhetoric. He always has had a terrible\ndisposition towards Palestine. He's always had a terrible disposition towards the Muslim world. You know, his segregationist\npast comes out sometimes when he starts talking\nabout the Muslim world, and you can hear the racism in his voice, and you can hear the way that he talks about Palestinian life\nin such devalued fashion. So he lost us a long time ago, but he's definitely not\ngetting us back after this in any way, and I can't\nspeak for all Muslims, but I think that come November, he and all of those politicians,\nespecially in swing states that have turned their backs\non the Muslim community, and not just the Muslim\ncommunity, by the way. 67% of this country wants a ceasefire. Three-fourths of Democratic\nvoters want a ceasefire. Half of Republican voters\nwant a ceasefire, right? It's not just the Muslim community. This is not some radical\nopinion to call for a ceasefire. And every single politician\nthat has refused to hear us is going to pay a price at\nthe polls, as they should. That doesn't mean that\nwe're under any illusion that the other side\npromises us anything better. In fact, it feels like\nRepublicans have simply rushed to out-racist the\nDemocrats, to outpace them in terms of talking about how they're going to be more unapologetic in supporting Israel\nunconditionally, right? Like it's been pathetic,\nbut something has to change, and I think that Americans\nof conscience have to look at how this failed political\nsystem has hurt people here and abroad, and talk about\nhow to transcend that with just more humanity. Again, when you have 67%\nof the American public that wants a ceasefire, but\nonly a handful of congressmen, out of over 500, can muster up the courage in the face of these super\nPACs to say that, you know, \"We should stop the genocide,\" right? And it's like, what are\nyou asking for here? You're asking for the genocide to stop. You're asking for Israeli\nhostages to be brought home. You're asking for Palestinian\nprisoners to be released. You're asking for peace and\nto start carving the path out to end this once and for all, right? In the most ambiguous way possible, by the way, because there aren't many radical American politicians, right? It's the way that the system is. In the most ambiguous, bare way possible, and you can't even bring\nyourself to do that. This is already a failed democracy then. All the while, again, you know,\nit always boggles my mind, if you're from the America First crew, what's America First about? Funneling billions and billions\nand billions of dollars to Israel while it\ncarries out this genocide while people are starving here. And if you're part of\nthe human rights crew and, you know, progressive\ncrew, it's, you know, they have a term called\n\"Progressive except Palestine,\" right, PEP, \"Progressive\nexcept Palestine.\" Where are all your\nnotions of social justice? You talk about policing here, but you don't talk about who\ntrains our police departments in many major cities and\nthe type of brutality that's being carried out there. You talk about human\nrights at the border here, but you don't talk about\nthe assault on people at the border there. You talk about all of these things here, but you somehow use\nthe exact same framings against the people there. So it's exposed, I think,\nthe moral bankruptcy of both political polar\nopposites that exist in this country right now, and hopefully, evoked a greater societal\nsentiment to say, \"This is ridiculous.\" You know, one of the\nthings that is happening is that more people are getting their news outside of legacy media outlets. You can't hide that many\ndead babies anymore. You just can't. More people have woken up to\nthe Palestinian plight now than ever before. More people are outraged that this has been our\nAmerican foreign policy all throughout, you know, Democratic and Republican administrations. This is what we've been paying for? This is what we've been excusing? And Israeli leaders\nliterally spit in the faces of whoever the American\npresident is, and says, \"Yeah, we don't care\nwhat they tell us to do.\" You know, American leadership\nsays we're pushing Israel to minimize the casualties\nto get less indiscriminate with its bombing, to manage the crisis, get a few more humanitarian corridors in, to make sure that that\nGaza is not evacuated and not ethnically cleansed, to make sure Palestinians can come back. And Netanyahu comes on TV and says, \"From the river to the sea.\" How ironic is that? From the river to the sea,\nand that is his policy. We're going to make sure\nthat Israel controls from the river to the sea, and we're going to push\nPalestinians into Sinai, and Muslim countries need to take them in. You have Israeli ministers,\nnational defense ministers, saying, you know, things openly, right? Like, \"We want to thin out the population, i.e., ethnic cleansing,\nwe want to remove people, and the Muslim world needs to step up and take in these refugees,\" right? And the American administration, you know, or the American president says, and American secretary\nof state says, you know, \"We're talking to them,\nand we're making sure that that's not gonna happen,\" and if one of their\nministers says something, Blinken maybe tweets out something about how that's not gonna happen, but then it happens anyway, and then we still write them the checks. So I think most of the American public is probably going to get\nsick of this at some point. Just people of decency\nand people of conscience are gonna say, \"Yeah,\nthis is not something we wanna a part of anymore.\" - Do you think there's something\nthat Donald Trump can do to help move this in the right direction? - Trump's first words were\nabout how he's gonna be worse on this, right? So he talked about how he's\ngoing to deport people, revoke visas of, you know, students that are part of these\npro-Palestinian rallies. - Also, the focus was on the rallies versus what's going on abroad. - Yeah, but look, we had\na Donald Trump presidency. He moved the embassy to Jerusalem. He was not better on this. Unfortunately, this is\na bipartisan problem. And so, again, we're\nunder no illusion here. Like we're not looking to\nDonald Trump as a savior here, but we are gonna penalize Joe Biden. And that's, you know, I\ncan't speak for everybody, but I think that that's\nwhere a lot of our minds are at right now."

      "section": "Ceasefire march",
      "text": "- You spoke at the November 4th\ndemonstration in Washington, called the Free Palestine March. It had a lot of people, several hundred thousand people there. What do you remember from that experience? - Well, the first thing I remember is that there was no news coverage of it. So 400,000 people march on DC, one of the largest marches in history. It was nowhere to be found\nin mainstream media coverage, whereas when the Stand\nwith Israel rally happened, between the 300,000-strong Palestine rally and the 400,000-strong Palestine rally, there was a Stand with Israel rally, where congressmen were bused from Congress to speak at that rally. Democrats and Republicans\nand high-profile celebrities, and it was, you know, live-streamed\nacross multiple places. I mean, I have to say this, the ICJ, if that wasn't the greatest\ndisplay of media bias in the domain of United\nStates mainstream media, then I don't know what is. They live-streamed the Israeli defense on multiple news outlets, defending itself against the case for genocide, and completely omitted the\nSouth African presentation of the crimes of Israel the day before. So what I remember, first and\nforemost, about the protest is that they were nowhere to\nbe found on mainstream media, which was expected, but\nwhat I also remember, from the actual day of, and from all of the pro-Palestine rallies, is that I have never\nseen a more multi-faith, more diverse group of people\nconsistently coming out for Palestine against the genocide in Gaza that I have this time around, and I think that has been\nthe experience all around. There has been a\npronounced Jewish presence, Jewish Voice for Peace, IfNotNow, other anti-Zionist Jewish groups, groups that are against the genocide, against the occupation,\nformer Israeli soldiers even, you know, that have been\nshowing up at these protests. There's been a pronounced presence from Native American\ngroups, Indigenous groups, all across the board, right? Christians, Jews, Muslims,\nI've never seen more diversity at these rallies than I've\nseen this time around, which I think is a sign\nof where things are going. And if you look at the\nunder-35 opinion polls, it's very clear that there's\na generational gap here, that the country is moving\ninto a more coherent direction and understanding what has\nbeen happening over there. And people from all backgrounds\nare standing up to it now. - What do you think about the protests on campus against Israel? - Every protest I've been to\nhas had the exact same tenor, has had the exact same messaging, but you always have that\nidiot or two that shows up with a sign, and no one knows\nwho that idiot is, ironically. Never comes with anybody else. Always shows up somehow in\nthe middle of the protest and puts up a sign that says\nsomething completely contrary to the messaging of the protest, then all the cameras\nshift towards that guy. I see it every single time,\nbut the overwhelming tenor of all of these protests\nhas been consistent. It's been calling for freedom, it's been calling for liberation, it's been calling for an end\nto the genocide, a ceasefire, an end to the occupation,\nan end to the apartheid. I will tell you what many\npeople are not seeing. Columbia University, two IDF\nsoldiers, former IDF soldiers, spraying Palestinian\nprotestors with skunk water, which is what the IDF uses\non Palestinian protestors and sometimes on worshipers on\ntheir way to Masjid Al-Aqsa, which has multiple health repercussions. And so I was reading about\nhow one of the students that was sprayed on campus at Columbia, Palestinian student,\nyou know, has showered, at this point of us doing this podcast, 11 times, cannot get the smell out of her, has suffered all sorts of health issues as a result of being sprayed. Again, people are not\nseeing the other side here. People are not seeing what\nwe've had to deal with at these protests, right? The open bigotry, and I want you to think about this, by the way. People go and serve in\nthe IDF and then come back to the United States\nor the United Kingdom, and they're not stigmatized\nfor participating in apartheid policies or\nparticipating in a genocide. How am I supposed to\nfeel as a Palestinian, knowing that this guy right\nnext to me participated in murdering my relatives in Gaza, right? And has open rein to\nsay what he wants to say or do what he wants to do. And so, we haven't seen the\nother side of that as well, but I'd recommend to anyone\nthat's talking about, you know, pro-Palestine\nprotests to actually go see one. If you go to the protests, you\nlisten to what's being said, and you don't just capture 'em. I mean you got 400,000 people. Don't just go try to find, you're gonna find four stupid people at a protest of 400,000 people, right? Because the protest scene is always messy. But I think that this is a sign\nof the outrage and the anger and the frustration\nthat many students have about being silenced. Again, in the media, in academic settings, professors are losing their jobs, students are having their\nfaces put on trucks, being doxed, shady watch\nlists that get put out. I'm on a few of them as well, and I just don't care anymore, right? But you got these shady watch lists. People are losing their jobs at law firms. They're losing all of\ntheir future opportunities, young Palestinian students,\nbecause of something that they tweeted that's\nbeing taken out of context 10 years ago, right, when\nthey were 17 years old. It's ridiculous, and so\nI think that, you know, we have to listen to the\noverwhelming majority of voices of people that are\ndemonstrating for justice, not demonstrating against anyone, but demonstrating for people. Again, there's a large,\npronounced Jewish presence at every single pro-Palestine march. In fact, if you look at the organizations, the groups that have\ntaken over Capitol Hill and, you know, train\nstations, it's been IfNotNow. \"Not in our Name,\" \"Never\nAgain\" means for anyone, right? It's been Jewish groups, many\nJewish anti-occupation groups that have been at the\nforefront, and I think that that's where we have to pay attention to the beauty of how diverse this movement for a free Palestine has actually been. - So the average sentiment\nis anti-occupation, not anti-Semitic. - It's incredibly lazy, incredibly lazy, to say that anti-Zionism or that anti-occupation is anti-Semitic. First and foremost, the\nPalestinians are a Semitic people. That's number one. Number two, look, I'm\nproud of my community. My community has stood\nagainst anti-Semitism in this country. The Muslim community has\nbeen at the forefront of condemning anti-Semitism. We have stood in front of synagogues, we have stood with the Jewish community when the Jewish community is attacked. This is about occupation. This is a story of a colonial entity that has driven us out of\nour homes and has done so in such a way that has forced\nus to try to be the voice of a people that are being\nexterminated overseas right now. This is not an anti-Semitic movement. This is a pro-freedom movement. - Do you think the\nprotests ever go too far? - The protest scene is a\nmessy scene, and so, again, you're gonna have\nsometimes that odd speaker or people get carried\naway in their emotions, and yes, sometimes people\nchant things or do things that are contrary to the protests. It's pretty unfair when you judge the entire protest movement by some of these incidents\nthat have happened at protests, and you don't pay attention to\nwhat they're protesting about in the first place, which is a genocide. Right now, everything is secondary to ending a genocide that is ongoing. In the course of this discussion,\nit's not an exaggeration to say that at least 30, 40\npeople would've been killed just over the last few hours because we're averaging 135 to 150 a day. So, everything else is secondary to that. This is where we all need to be right now as people of conscience. How do we stop this because every single day is deeply costly. - Do you think there has\nbeen a rise of anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hate in the US? - Yeah, I think that's factual. Look, anti-Semitism is\nalways to be condemned. It's wrong, it's something that, as a Muslim community and\nas people of conscience, we have always taken a stand against. Jewish people should not be attacked for being Jewish people\nhere or anywhere else. Synagogues should be protected,\nand if a person is attacked for being Jewish, we\nwill be the first to go and to stand with them and to\nreject that attack on them. And there has been, as I said, an inspiring pronounced Jewish presence in the movement to end the occupation. And so we're being\nmorally consistent here. As far as the rise in\nIslamophobia, it is felt, it's under-reported, and it is, you know, part of the same framing that\nhas led to the devastation of our people overseas. So there's a rise in Islamophobia, there's a rise in anti-Semitism,\nthere's a rise in hatred. All of that is true, but there's\nalso an ongoing genocide, and that should be our\npriority, right now, to end."

      "section": "Benjamin Netanyahu",
      "text": "- I think we spoke last\ntime, about a year ago, how has your view on Benjamin\nNetanyahu evolved over time? - Benjamin Netanyahu has committed himself to the erasure of Palestinian\npeople and Palestinian symbols and Palestinian land\nfrom the very beginning of his political career. This is who he has been. We just haven't been listening to him. He campaigned on bigotry and\nracism and on the promise that there would never\nbe a Palestinian state. He campaigned on the promise\nthat Gaza would be wiped out. He campaigned by saying, \"The Arabs are rushing to the polls. We need to make sure that\nthey don't infect our policy.\" He has always been this person, this has always been his policy, he has always indicated that genocide and ethnic cleansing is\nwhere he wants to go. So he's simply manifesting what\nhis message has always been, and anyone that ignores\nthat is being disingenuous. You can find statements\nfrom Benjamin Netanyahu in the 80s, 90s, 2000s. You can find him talking about\nthis prior to October 7th and after October 7th. He's definitely doing this now\nto save his political career. I think he wants to drive this\nas long as he possibly can because he knows that his\ndays in office are numbered, but let's also ask ourselves, why is it that Benjamin Netanyahu\nwas able to rise to power in the first place, right? There's something deeply\ntroubling about the fact that his messaging ever resonated\nand what the prospects are for peace if Benjamin\nNetanyahu was able to rise with such pronounced hateful messaging. - So the claim that security of Israel is the primary concern is,\nyou're saying, a dishonest claim. - I think he's trying to\nsecure his seat in office. He knows his days are numbered. This is not about Israel,\nthis isn't about the hostages for him, this isn't about\nanything but Benjamin Netanyahu. He is a narcissist, he's a tyrant, he is despised around the world. And I think even amongst Israelis, I think there's a depatriate form. I think the hostages' families\nknow that he doesn't care about the families or about the hostages, but he's driving a political agenda that doesn't care about people, not Palestinian people or otherwise. However, the problem of the occupation is not Benjamin Netanyahu. The problem of the\noccupation is the occupation. Yair Lapid was the progressive,\nmoderate alternative, and he drove just as bigoted of an agenda against the Palestinian\npeople as possible, so to the Palestinian\nthat's living in Gaza or the Palestinian in the\nWest Bank, whoever's sitting in that seat has meant the\nexact same thing to them, but Benjamin Netanyahu\nis certainly, I think, the loudest bigot that we have\nseen, you know, in that seat. - Do you think Israel has the\nright to defend its borders? - I think Israel has a responsibility to protect those that it occupies. I think you have to ask\nthat question differently. You know, Noura Erakat wrote\na tremendous article on this from a legal perspective. You know, when you talk about\nIsrael defending itself, Israel is bound to occupation law. This is the problem all along. You know, when John Kerry said,\nof course, the US is great, sometimes, at issuing\ninconsequential statements, but Israel has to choose\nwhether or not it wants to be a Jewish or a democratic state, be a Jewish or a democratic\nstate, but it can't be both. Israel wants to occupy and\ndeny, and at the same time, not be held to the standards\nof being an occupier, but be treated as if\nit's some normal state. Those borders were drawn\nacross occupied land, and have been expanding\ninto Palestinian territory, and people have been thrown out of their homes systematically\nand transgressed upon even in the places that they\nfled to, which is Gaza, right? So when you talk about\nIsrael having a right to defend itself, you should\nbe talking about Israel's duty to protect everyone under its occupation. Either lift the occupation or protect everyone under your occupation. Where are your borders, right? What is your responsibility? Who are you protecting? And I think that it speaks to the fact that Israeli policy considers\nPalestinians to be animals. They say as much, and they do as much. I've spoken about James Baldwin, and James Baldwin talked\nabout this pious silence surrounding Israel that\nwe're supposed to pretend like it's just another state, you know? And ignore how it came into\nbeing and what it functions as. And I think that pious\nsilence has to be broken. You know, I remember Jon Stewart when he had \"The Daily\nShow\" several years ago, and he talked about this\npolicy of, you know, we have to defend ourselves, and if someone was attacking\nyour home, what would you do? And the response was, \"Well,\nwhy are you forcing people into a closet?\" So you force people into\nthis desperate situation. You drive them out of their\nhomes, claim their homes, and then say that you're\ndefending yourself against them. The default is that an\noccupied people have a right to defend themselves. The occupier is obligated\nto those that they occupy. - Can you speak to this\nterm, occupation, in Gaza because the people that say\nit is not an occupation say that Israeli troops have\nbeen pulled out from there, before October 7th, for many years. - [Omar] Yeah. - And to you, it still\nis a de facto occupation. - Israel doesn't get to set\nthe terms and then define them. It is an occupation according\nto any legal standard, international legal standard. Israel controls the movements\nof everyone in Gaza. It controls the air and the seas. It controls the ability\nto import or export. The people that live in Gaza\nand the people that live in the West Bank, the Palestinians, have had their identity stolen from them. So there's the freedom of movement, there is the freedom of thriving, there is self-determination, all of that has been stolen\nfrom the people of Gaza. There's no airport in Gaza. That was destroyed by Israel as well. It is an occupation at every level, and by any meaningful legal determination."

      "text": "- What do you think about\nYemen's Houthi rebels attacking Israel in\nresponse to October 7th, and then the United States\nand the UK initiating bombing of multiple targets in\nYemen in response to that? - Yeah, I think that it's clear that the United States cares\nmore about its shipping lanes than it does about Palestinian lives, and that actually has proved it. Look, I do not support\nthe Houthis as Houthis or their policies in general, but if you look at what has transpired and what they have said,\nthey're attacking these ships in response to the occupation\nor in response to the genocide and saying that they\nwill continue to do so to stop business as usual\nuntil a ceasefire is reached. They have not killed anyone, right? They have ceased ships,\nthey have blocked the lanes, but they have said that\nif a ceasefire happens, they will cease their activity. So instead of the United States trying to get a ceasefire through, the United States decided,\n\"Let's go bomb Yemen too.\" You know, let's spend\nmore money on weapons and killing innocent people,\nwhich shows you exactly where our policy always leads\nitself to, unfortunately. So I think that most\nreasonable people would say that the problem is not with\nYemeni rebels attacking ships. The problem is with Israel attacking innocent Palestinian lives."

      "section": "Hostages",
      "text": "- You mentioned paying\nrespects to the legacy of EBJ, Eddie Bernice Johnson, and remembering Palestinian\nchild prisoners. Can you explain? - So Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson was one of the few co-sponsors of a bill that has been on the floor\nof Congress for years, initially sponsored by\nCongresswoman Betty McCollum, to penalize Israel for its\ndetention of child prisoners. Thousands of children\narbitrarily detained, put in military courts,\nsolitary confinement, and yes, sexual violence,\nthat's been documented by human rights\norganizations, against them, and there have been no repercussions. So I want you to think about this. You know, just the thought of\nconditioning aid to Israel, you know, so that it doesn't\nindiscriminately bomb entire populations has not\nbeen able to find any home in mainstream American politics for years. Just trying to stop Israel\nfrom picking up children and throwing them into military prisons, where they disappear for decades at times, has not found any thrust in\nmainstream American politics, whereas any resolution that is pro-Israel will make it past both\nchambers relatively quickly. When people talk about Israeli hostages and then talk about Palestinian prisoners, there's already a problem\nwith that framing. First of all, all 2.2 million\npeople in Gaza are hostages. Every Palestinian that lives\nunder occupation is a hostage, but all of those prisoners\nthat have been picked up, women, children, innocent people, with absolutely no process of making sure that they're treated right\nor given fair trials, or even given a communication\nline with their families or with any government to help\nthem, is absolutely criminal. All of those prisoners are also hostages. And when you already propose this idea that there are Israeli hostages\nand Palestinian prisoners, you're already implying\nthat one group is complicit in their own devastation,\nwhereas another group has had devastation visited upon them entirely out of their own doing. And so it's important for people to learn about children\nprisoners, who are indeed hostages to an apartheid system,\nand even what happened during that four-day truce, which all of us hoped would be extended and become permanent, where 150 Palestinian\nprisoners were released. Israel just went and picked up another 135 in the West Bank and\nthrew them in prisons. That's what I mean when I say you're not addressing\nthe root of the problem. The root of the problem is the occupation. The root of the problem is the apartheid. The root of the problem is the desperation that then drives the creation\nof all sorts of circumstances that will only further lead to the devastation of everyone, right? If you don't solve that\nproblem, and at the root of that problem is the\ndehumanization of the Palestinian, because no one is raising alarms for those Palestinian hostages\nin Israeli military prisons, no one's putting up their pictures, and no one's talking about who they are and their human stories, and the violence that's been wreaked against\nthem at every level. So if you don't solve, not\njust the root of occupation, but also the dehumanization\nthat drives the occupation, which is, unfortunately,\nso pervasive right now in the discourse, then\nyou're going to continue to have this gap in how\nthe world sees the plight of the Palestinians\nand how, unfortunately, the American public sees the\nproblem of the Palestinians. - And to you, big peace agreements like, of the like of Abraham Accords\nshould include Palestine. - Abraham Accords is\nnothing but an agreement in which you slap the name\nof Abraham on arms deals. In exchange for countries being able to undertake their own unholy pursuits, they use one of the\nholiest names in history and continue to erase the\nmain victims of this atrocity. And so the Abraham Accords\nare an insult to humanity, an insult to the Palestinians, and an insult to the name of Abraham. - But do you think something like that, agreements of that nature, of that scale, could be made that include\nthe Palestinian people, and that would actually make progress? - If they're honest to the\nplight of the Palestinians, if they are honest to the roots\nof the problem, absolutely. Look, again, peace is sought, but peace cannot be used to silence. The entire peace process has, you know, been hung over the\nPalestinians all of these years while settlements continued to expand and their situation only\ncontinued to get worse. Is Israel really going\nto remove the 700,000, 800,000 settlers, right,\nand suddenly changes tune on a two-state solution? Benjamin Netanyahu is saying right now, and he's speaking to, unfortunately, what is clearly a majority\nof the Israeli public, that there will never\nbe a Palestinian state. So these peace talks cannot be used to suffocate all of the work of justice and bringing Israel to accountability. The world has to act\nwhen they see apartheid. The world has to act\nwhen they see occupation. If the world fails to bring Israel to a place of accountability, then a few countries that\nhave their own agendas cannot put forth anything\nmeaningful for the victims of Israel being the Palestinian people."

      "section": "MLK Jr and Malcolm X",
      "text": "- There's a lot of\nquestions I wanna ask you about the nature of resistance, and what is the proper way to resist? What is the practical, pragmatic, effective ways of resisting? So one example that is often\nbrought up is the difference between MLK and Malcolm X. One emphasized non-violent resistance, the other emphasized\nany-means-necessary resistance. Which do you side with, in general and in this particular\ncase of what has happened over the past a hundred-plus days? - So, in general, that framing\nrelies on a sanitization of Dr. Martin Luther King\nJr. and a vilification of Malcolm X that a lot of\npeople do put forth and present as two polar opposites in how\nthey approached the plight of Black people in America and resisting racism here in America. When I taught a course at\nSouthern Methodist University on MLK and Malcolm X, and Islam and the civil rights movement, what I'd often do is I'd give\nmy students a set of quotes, and I would say, \"Assign\nthis to Malcolm or Martin,\" and they'd always get it wrong, right? So you can find, you know, quotes from MLK and breaking the silence, and especially when he took a\nstand against the Vietnam War, that sound so radical, you\nknow, when you compare them to the image of MLK, and\nMalcolm is, of course, turned into this militant, angry Muslim who just wanted violence and was seeking chaos\nhere in the United States. So let's be clear about something here, that Malcolm never himself\nwas part of any violence. Malcolm never did anything violent. Malcolm found it hypocritical\nto commit the oppressed people to non-violence while not\nrestraining the oppressor from its violence, and\nI agree with Malcolm. It is absolutely hypocritical\nto focus your attention and your energy on the oppressed people and committing them to non-violence while not directing your\nattention to the oppressor. When you have such asymmetry, when you have a clear\naggressor and aggressed-upon, you have a clear colonial entity and a clear colonized\npeople, you focus your energy on restraining the colonial power, you focus your energy on\nrestraining the oppressor, not the oppressed, and so\nthat was Malcolm's point, and it's clear in his messaging, throughout his religious growth, because, of course, Malcolm\ndid evolve as a person, but Malcolm found it deeply hypocritical to commit the oppressed to non-violence. Malcolm also had a deep\nunderstanding of the way that brutality here, state\nviolence in the United States, was connected to its state violence abroad and American imperialism as a whole. Malcolm was the first to speak on Vietnam, the first major African American\nleader to speak on Vietnam. Martin followed. Malcolm also went to Gaza in 1964. 1964, went to Khan Yunis, which is now under heavy bombardment, and Malcolm penned an essay on Zionism and connected Zionism\nto American imperialism and the broader implications\nof America's foreign policy. So Martin and Malcolm, if you look at them in the capacity of what's\nhappening right now, where I would say you can find something that is deeply profound, James Cone wrote a book\ncalled \"Malcolm and Martin, Dreams and Nightmares.\" And he wrote something\nprofound to the effect that Martin tried to liberate white people from their own racism,\nwhereas Malcolm tried to liberate Black people from the effects of that racism on them. And so they both played\na deeply important role. Self-determination is\ncrucial to maintain the fuel of a movement, and I\nthink one of the things that probably deeply frustrates those that have sought the erasure of Palestine is that Palestinian\nconsciousness has only continued to grow after 75 years. Palestinians in diaspora and Palestinians within\noccupied territory, all are deeply rooted in\ntheir Palestinian identity and existence, and they're not going away. So I think that that's where\nthe function is important of this, whereas those that are complicit in the oppression need to be liberated from their own oppression, you know, and liberated from what\nthey're participating in. Most Americans that I talk to,\nthat have absolutely no idea about what's going on, when they come to hear just a few stories of the plight of the Palestinian people,\nand the types of brutality that we have encountered,\nwake up to this and say, \"Oh my God, this is what\nmy tax dollars go to? This is what I'm a part of,\" right? So we have to liberate\npeople, across the board, from being oppressors\nor from being oppressed. - What do you think about\nthe seeming fact the majority of Palestinians support\nthe October 7th attacks? - You have to see the world,\ntheir world through their eyes. You can't try to see their\nworld through your eyes. If you live under occupation, you're routinely harassed\nat Israeli checkpoints, the occupation is expanding\ninto your territory, you're meeting families,\nyou know, regularly that have been thrown out of their homes and that are looking for a new place in the shrinking territory, you deal with routine airstrikes, you have no way to get out,\nyou have no way to grow, you don't even have a passport,\nyour education is subpar, your standards of living\nare lower than the rest of the world, and all you\nhear from the other side, which dominates the discourse\nand dominates every element of your existence, are\npromises of erasure, of complete erasure. 13,000 people I mentioned, 2023, 13,000 new settlement\nunits being advanced. If that happened anywhere, right, just think about what that means, right? When you clear out a village or two, and it's not that big\nof a territory, right? When you know that that's happening, and when you have been subjected to that, anyone that claims to be\nsupporting you or uplifting you from that state of misery\nis going to have sympathy. Whether you agree with their\nmission or their methods or not, it's human. It is human that if anyone says that they are going to\nget you out of this misery and inflict pain on those who\nhave given you a life of pain and promised you a future of pain, you're going to have\nsympathy to that group, whether you agree with them or not. I think that the question\nalso has to be asked, what about the Israeli public? Israel holds all of the\npower in that region, holds all of the power\nover that territory, is able to dominate the\nexpansion of its own territory and diminish any Palestinian territory, is able to place restrictions whenever it wants on Palestinian movement, trying to get to their\nholy sites or otherwise, whether it's Masjid Al-Aqsa\nor the Holy Sepulcher or the Church of Nativity, right? The majority of these Israeli\npublic, before October 7th, unfortunately, according to all polls, favors a non-democratic regime, the end of a two-state solution, does not care about the\nplight of Palestinian people, the majority of the Israeli public. Why is that, and what does that mean for Palestinians, right? Especially now, after this\ngenocide, the vast majority of the Israeli public does\nnot favor a ceasefire, right? What are we supposed to do when we see mainstream\nmedia coming out of Israel, pop culture, TikTok videos that only speak to a greater desire to eliminate the\nPalestinian people, right? So anyone that says that they are going to\nsupport your plight, whether you agree with their\nmission or their methods, is going to resonate with\nthat child that has grown up in those desperate circumstances. You know, Bassem Yousef had an\ninterview with Piers Morgan, and he was talking about this. I mean, just, he literally\ngave it a human story. If you're a child that's\ngrown up, you've lost limbs, your parents are dead,\nyour friends are dead, you have been made a refugee\ntwo or three times already, you have no future in sight,\nand then someone comes to you and says, \"I'm going to help you, and I'm gonna fight back on your behalf,\" of course, it's gonna resonate. It's human, right? And so, I think that it's important for us to see the world through their eyes, rather than try to see the\nworld through our eyes. - So as Malcolm X did, you're calling for highlighting the asymmetry in violence and asymmetry in moral reasoning. - Absolutely. It's important. You're not going to be\nable to solve this problem unless you're able to do that. And so when Malcolm said that, \"If you stick a knife\nnine inches into my back and pull it out six inches,\nthat's not progress.\" Progress is healing the wounds, and you're not even willing to acknowledge that the knife is there yet. Those that don't acknowledge\nwhat is determined now by any international\nhuman rights organization, even Israeli human rights\norganization, B'Tselem and others, to be apartheid, a state of apartheid and a state of occupation,\nand now an unfolding genocide, you know, are not partners for peace. - It just hurts me to think\nhow long it takes to heal. Even if the healing begins\nnow with a knife metaphor, it's just going to be generations because people don't forget. When your father and mother were murdered, or somebody that you know\nin your family was killed, they don't forget. - Look, I think the point\nis, is that we have to come to terms with the fact that the trauma of the past does not justify\nthe murder of the present, and the fear of the future\ndoes not justify the murder of the present. The urgency of the world right now should be entirely focused on ending this atrocity\nthat, unfortunately, the world has become so complacent with. Again, prior to October\n7th, this status quo was not acceptable, and\nthere was no means in sight in the global arena to rein this in, to make Israel more\naccountable, to stop this. I do believe in the power of healing, I do believe in the power of growth, I do believe that we have\nseen ugly episodes of history before that have been rectified. I also believe in the heart of my people. I believe that the\nPalestinian people are people of resistance, they're\npeople of resilience, they're people of courage, and\nthey're people of benevolence and magnanimity, and they\nare people who have been made to grow under the worst of circumstances. I don't see, in the hearts\nof young Palestinians that have been tormented,\nI don't see darkness. I see light, I see the\nability to still laugh and find joy despite\neverything that's happened. And so I think that the urgency right now just has to be towards\nensuring that they have a life, that they're not being killed anymore."

      "text": "- I was wondering if you can\ncomment on a idea and a notion that comes up often in\nconversations about this, of why can't other nations in the region take in Palestinian refugees? - So I think that we have\nto tackle what's implied by that at multiple levels,\nand I actually wanna walk back. You know, I was listening\nto Nikki Haley when she said in one of her interviews,\nyou know, \"And why is it that you think no one wants\nto take the Palestinians in?\" And she had like this deeply\ndisturbing laugh to it, or Ben Shapiro, when he\nsaid, \"Israelis like to build and Arabs like to bomb crap\nand live in their sewage,\" or, you know, why is it that no one wants to govern the Palestinians,\nsuggesting that Palestinians are ungovernable and not fit\nto bring into your countries, and that's why they're being turned away. You know who else faced that bigotry? Jews trying to escape the Holocaust. 1939, 300,000 Germans\napplied for refuge here in the United States. I think only about 10,000 were allowed in, and we also turned away ships of Jews that were seeking refuge\nhere in the United States. On what basis, that they were\na national security threat and could not be trusted,\nthey could not be taken in. That's the same bigotry\nthat's driving this. And I want you to think\nabout it, you know, from that perspective, how\ndeeply offensive that is when you have millions of\nPalestinians in diaspora. Where have Palestinians caused\ntrouble where they've gone? Everywhere Palestinians are, they have overcome significant\nhurdles to become scientists and doctors and to grow\nthemselves and to grow the places that they're in. Where have Palestinians\nthat have been displaced all over the world caused\nissues for people, right? So it's both racist and\nfactually incorrect. That's not the right question\nthat should be asked. The question that should be asked are why are these people\ndriven from their homes, not why won't other people around them open their homes to them? And so, I'll just share with you that, even on a personal level, you\nknow, it's really interesting because sometimes on\nTwitter or wherever it is, it'll be like, \"Go back home,\" right? Why don't you go back home? And I'm sitting there\nthinking to myself like, \"Sure, you know, my parents\nwere driven from their homes.\" Yeah, sure, I was born in this country as a consequence of bad policy. Now I embrace my complicated\nidentity in that regard, and I hope to be\nproductive as an American, but I am a Palestinian, and\nPalestinians in diaspora that have been fortunate enough\nto have the ability to build and to overcome circumstances\nshould not be an excuse for eliminating the Palestinians\nthat remain in their homes under that torment, so\nthis bigotry is not new. Unfortunately, its manifestation is ugly, and, you know, we have to push back on it whenever it shows itself, no matter who it's being spoken about. - How difficult has it been\nfor people in Gaza to flee? - I mean, they're blockaded\nfrom all directions. There is nowhere for people in Gaza to go. They cannot get out, and, you know, the reality is, is that\nthey don't wanna leave. They do not wanna leave. The Palestinian people\nwant to live in their land and their homes and to\ncontinue to produce, you know, an extension\nof the beautiful culture and legacy that was handed to them. They don't wanna leave, in\nfact, those that have fled for whatever reason, or\nhave been able to get out for medical treatment or\nbecause they have some sort of citizenship in other countries,\nall they're talking about is going back and rebuilding. You can't bomb Palestine\nout of our hearts. You cannot starve Palestine\nout of our hearts. I think that's a critical\nmistake that Israel is making, and it thinks that if\nit destroys Gaza enough, if it wipes out all the buildings, that people will never wanna come back. We don't want to go anywhere\nas a Palestinian people, you know, in a way that would\nremove us from our homes. - The Palestinian people are proud people. - Yeah, you've met a lot of 'em, right? When you sat with Mohammed El-Kurd, their people in East Jerusalem. What those people have been\nsubjected to, you know, the harassment, like,\nthink about the tenacity and the character that it takes to still try to walk back into your home after an intruder has been\nbrought in by the state that's sitting in your living room, that is pushing you\naround, and you're saying, \"I'm not leaving my home.\" This is literally what's been\nhappening in East Jerusalem, and we're not going anywhere. I think those of us that are in diaspora, Palestine is not leaving our hearts, and those of us that are still there are not leaving their land. And the world has to make the\noccupier more accountable, not tell the occupied how to cope. - Do you ever imagine that\nif your family did not flee and you were now living in, say, in Gaza, what you would be doing? - I think about what could\nhave been all the time. You know, I actually mentioned\nthis in the first DC protest, that I remember getting a\nnotification, a news notification, just prior to October, with\nmy name in it, you know, so I always get these\nnotifications, right? If my name's been mentioned in an article. And so, oh, your name's been\nmentioned in an article, and it was a 16-year-old Omar Suleiman who was murdered in the West Bank. He literally had my name. I held up his picture, and I realized that could have been me. So I think of why God\nchose me to not be there, and, hopefully, him choosing\nall of us that are not there to be for those that are still\nthere, to be their voices. I'm grateful, and I'm also in pain. I'm grateful for the opportunity to be able to speak on their\nbehalf, but I'm also guilty that they have to bear the\nbrunt of this evil hatred that, unfortunately, displaced our parents in the first place. - You mentioned that\nPalestinians invoke the plight of Indigenous people,\nlike Native Americans. What works and doesn't\nwork about this analogy? - So I think that there's\na powerful connection between the Palestinian\npeople and the Indigenous in this land and in other\nplaces that have been wronged. We are living here in the\nUnited States on stolen lands that is drenched in the\nblood of the Natives, and that was built upon with the blood, sweat, and labor of enslaved Africans that were brought from overseas. It's a great evil that we have\nto reckon with constantly. And so I think that's\nthe power of solidarity, and, you know, if you look in Canada and you look in places like Australia, there has been a refocus on the crimes against the Indigenous of those places. I think that what makes\nthe Palestinian plight deeply painful, and\nmaybe where the analogy even doesn't do justice, is\nthat from the river to the sea is less than 500 times\nwhat the United States is in terms of land. It's not that big of a piece of land, and so the original lie\nwas a land without a people for a people without a land, and the problem was that\nthere were people on that land that were forcibly removed. So I think that the sheer size, right, we're talking about a tiny piece of land, and a lot of people that\nwere removed forcefully from their land, and they\ncontinue to be brutalized under those miserable conditions."

      "section": "Muhammad and Jesus",
      "text": "- Why is Palestine a\nspecial place, a holy land? - It's the land of prophets. It is a land that holds deep\nsignificance, obviously, to Jews, Christians, and Muslims. It's the land of Abraham,\npeace be upon him. It is the land that has\nsuch a rich history to it that connects multiple\npeoples in multiple ways. It's precious. I think that history, while\nit tells the story of tragedy and struggle over that piece of land, also tells a beautiful story of sanctity. - So you mentioned Abraham, prophets. Prophet Mohammed is deeply\nvenerated in Islam, obviously, but other prophets are as\nwell, Jesus being one of them. What are the similarities and differences in the teachings from these two prophets? - Well, Islam refers to this\nidea of submission to one God and attaining peace in the process, and refers to the way of life that prophets have all come\nwith, which is this idea of monotheism and serving that one God in the way that he\ncommands you to serve him. So to us, as it says in the Quran, that we do not distinguish\nbetween the prophets. All of the prophets came with\none message, one mission. There's a coherence in the creed, there's a beauty in the foundation of what would become the legislation of each of those prophets. And we see them all as\nsiblings in prophethood. And so we say, \"Abraham,\npeace be upon him.\" We say, \"Jesus, peace be upon him.\" We say, \"Moses, peace be upon him.\" We say, \"Mohammed, peace be upon him.\" We believe that Moses came to confirm what came from Abraham, Jesus came to confirm\nwhat came from Moses, Mohammed came to confirm\nwhat came from Jesus. They upheld the same message. God did not change over\ntime, nor did the centrality of his message of\nmonotheism change over time. And so to us, it's one beautiful house. There's a saying from\nthe Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, where\nhe describes the house of prophethood, each\nprophet being a brick, and him simply being the last\nbrick of a beautiful house. And so we love the prophets\nof God, and we believe that they each came with the legislation that was necessary for the\ntime, but with the same message. - So the message is\nfundamentally the same. Is there a difference in\nemphasis, for example, the emphasis on love with Jesus? - Yeah, you know, this is, it's\nlike when you talk about MLK and Malcolm to an extent, except there was actually\nsome difference, right, between MLK and Malcolm. - [Lex] Yes. - You know, I just think that\nthe difference is exaggerated between them, but I don't think that Moses didn't emphasize\nlove, but Jesus emphasized love, and then Mohamed didn't emphasize love, peace be upon them all. I think that they each\nemphasized the same attributes and names of God and ways of knowing God, but there were, of course,\nchanges within legislation, changes within the divine law, but the divine spirit remained the same, and so I don't see them as\nbeing counter to each other, nor do I see that any\nprophet betrayed the message that came before them. I think they're all part of\nthe same beautiful message that we have to be at\nharmony with our creator and that we turn towards\nhim for our guidance, and that when we do so, we establish a greater\nexistence here on Earth. And so I think that that's\nsomething that's consistent throughout the message\nof all the prophets. - You have been longtime friends with and had amazing conversations\nwith people of other faiths, Christian, Jewish. How has the events of October 7th and the days after affected\nthis, in the United States, your ability to have\ninterfaith conversations, connections, relationships, friendships? - Complicated, very complicated. And it's not just Muslims and Jews, it's also Christian Zionists. Christian Zionism is at\nthe root of the problem, in my opinion, especially\nwhen we talk about what drives America's unshakeable, unconditional commitment to Israel. It's devastating, I think, to Palestinian Christians in particular, when Israel can bomb some\nof the oldest churches of Christianity in Gaza and\nkill Palestinian Christians, and Palestinian Christians are barred from going to the Holy Sepulcher or to their places of worship\nin Bethlehem or Jerusalem, and Christians here in the United States turn their back on them. I think that it is\nparticularly outrageous, so it's complicated. Look, I expect more from people\nin the face of a genocide. We don't have to agree\non all the particulars, but we can agree that what is happening is morally outrageous, and so I think that I've had a few people\nthat have reached out and said, \"I wanna say something, but I can't,\" and I've had to respond,\n\"Well, that's not good enough.\" So I think that we have a problem, and instead of focusing on that problem, I'd like to focus on the more\nmorally consistent voices across faiths that have\nrisen to the moment, rather than those that have failed. - So you wish more rabbis would be able to have a conversation\nlike we're having today, and also not allow it to be seen as them turning their\nback on their religion. - Rabbis, pastors, again,\nit's not just, you know, Jewish leadership, it's\nalso Christian leadership. I think that it's important for those that have claim to be allies in the fight against Islamophobia to see that you cannot be opposed to Islamophobia while also extending\nanti-Palestinian bigotry. - Yeah, one of the things,\nsince we last spoke, I've gotten to meet a lot\nof Palestinian Christians, including in West Bank,\nand that was fascinating, and those are beautiful people. - I think people should watch Reverend Munther Isaac's\nsermon on Christmas, \"Jesus in the Rubble.\" It was deeply profound. You know, I had a chance\nto speak to Mitri Raheb from the Lutheran church there as well. Now they're devastated. You know, it was eyeopening\nto many people here when Justin Amash, who was a\nRepublican congressman, right, Palestinian Christian\nRepublican congressman, posted about his own family dying in one of the church bombings. So it's strange, strange times,\nand I think that it shows that the philosophy of hate\nthat drives this terrible policy is secular at its root and not religious. - One of the criticisms of\nIslam points to specific verses of the Quran, and the criticism being that it is not a religion of peace. Can you speak to that? - So, objectively speaking,\nif you were to take the verses of the Quran about\nviolence and compare them, just from a purely\npercentage-based comparison, to the New Testament\nand the Old Testament, you would find less verses\nabout war in the Quran than the Old Testament\nor the New Testament, and there are plenty of\nstudies to speak to that. Deeper than that, contextualizing\nthe birth of Islam, the revelation of the Quran,\nwhich was over 23 years, in response to deep persecution of the Prophet Mohammed,\npeace be upon him, makes it very clear that\nnone of those verses are what they've been made out to be. If Muslims believed that\nthey had to kill people wherever they are,\nmankind would not exist. There are two billion of us, right? If we believe that we\nwere called by the Quran to hurt people and to kill people simply for being non-believers, right, it would not make for a sustainable world. So Islam is not violent,\nand I think that the history of Muslims also bears witness to that. The history of Islam is a\nhistory of contribution, is a history of building,\nis a history of medicine and science and math, and, of course, Muslims have sometimes fallen\nshort of Islamic standards in the past and in the present, but if you look at the\noverall history of Islam and the history of the Muslim community, that's not the case. And when you look at the present,\nyou know, Muslim community around the world, Muslims do not account for a greater proportion of violence than other faith communities. And again, the word\nterrorist is a functionless and meaningless word because,\nto me, it's no less violent if it's commanded by a head\nof state or by a government than by a non-state actor. So Muslims do not account\nfor a greater portion of violence now, nor have they accounted for a greater portion\nof violence in the past. - Why do you think these\nnarratives have taken hold in present discourse, at\nleast in the United States? - Because they allow for greater violence against the Muslim community\ndomestically and abroad. The United States has launched wars against primarily Muslim countries, right? And has a particularly\nviolent foreign policy towards the Muslim world. And the Muslim community\nhere in the United States has dealt with, unfortunately, multiple aggressive iterations of programs of suppression and surveillance under Republican and\nDemocratic administrations. And so there's a convenience\nto that Islamophobia, there's a convenience to that framing of the Muslim community\nthat also distracts from other forms of violence\nthat are deeply pervasive and present, including the\nones that are committed by the government itself."

      "section": "Al-Aqsa Mosque",
      "text": "- If it's okay, you've\nmentioned Al-Aqsa mosque a couple of times. I would love it if you can describe why it is such an important\nplace, a holy place, for Muslims in general, but\nalso for this particular crisis that we have been speaking about today. - So Muslims honor the history of all of the prophets, right? So all of the prophets that\nhave walked in that place, all of the prophets that\nhave worshiped in that place, all of that makes it sacred, right? So it's not separated from\nMuslims from, you know, post-Mohammed, peace be upon\nhim, versus prior to Mohammed, peace be upon him, in terms\nof the sanctity of that place. So we honor it, and Masjid\nAl-Aqsa, in particular, is the place where the Prophet\nMohammed, peace be upon him, leads the other prophets\nin prayer in the night of what's known as Al-Isra' wal-Mi'raj, the night journey of the\nprophet, peace be upon him, and then he ascends to\nthe heavens and back, and it's also the first qibla, which is the first place of\ndirection of prayer for us. So before Muslims faced Mecca in prayer, for the first half of Islam, they actually faced towards\nJerusalem in their prayer. It was our direction of prayer, and it remained a fundamental\npart of our faith, a fundamental holy sanctuary. There are three sanctuaries in Islam, Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem, and Masjid Al-Aqsa is precious to us. And so you can imagine then\nthe pain of watching, you know, innocent Palestinian\nworshipers being stomped on by Israeli soldiers or skunk\nwater being sprayed on people as they're trying to\nwalk in, or, you know, teargassing taking place\nin the nights of Ramadan in that place, the restrictions on people that live right next to it,\nand that cannot pray in it due to the certain\nclassification of Palestinian that they've been given,\nor the age, right, because, generally\nspeaking, if you're younger, you're not allowed to\ngo to Masjid Al-Aqsa, even if you live within\nthe occupied territory, so it's tough to watch such a sacred place with such an ugly occupation,\nbut I'll also say this, that the sanctity of a human being, the sanctity of just one person, is greater than the sanctity\nof any place of worship to us. So the sanctity of one individual in Gaza, or one individual in\nJerusalem is greater to us than the sanctity of a place of worship, but it is all certainly interconnected. - That's a really powerful idea. The value of a human being is greater than even the Al-Aqsa mosque. That's a foundational idea for Islam? - The Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, says to the Kaaba itself that the value of a believer's dignity and\nhonor is greater than the value of the structure itself,\nand so, when I see a person in Gaza aggressed upon, when\nI see one Wael Al-Dahdouh, when I see one child, that's greater to me than even Al-Aqsa, but\nAl-Aqsa is at the heart of who we are as well, and\nit's certainly at the heart of the Palestinian cause. It's a place of prophets, and it's a place that should be treated prophetically. - You mentioned to me\nthat since October 7th, a lot of young people\nin the United States, and in general, have been\nshowing interest in Islam. First of all, can you explain\nwhat you've been seeing and experiencing in terms of that trend? - Yeah, we have Quran TikTok trends, where you had a few people\nthat went on camera and said, \"You know, I'm reading the\nQuran for the first time.\" And I think that that's\nthe beauty of the faith of the people of Gaza, the\nbeauty of their resilience. You know, when you're\nlooking at these people living what's hell on earth but they're seeking paradise outside, and they're able to still\nbe inspired towards words of faith and determination and certainty, you're like, what is their secret, right? What are they reading? What are they on that allows them to still face this brutality\nwith such grace, right? I mean, they're not shouting profanities, they're not shouting, you\nknow, words of emptiness or despair, but rather, they\nare pouring out their hearts that are full of faith\nfor the world to see, and I think that a lot\nof people have seen that and said, \"What is that?\" And so, you know, we've\nhad multiple people come to the mosque. I've never seen more people\nbecome Muslim in my life, but not just that, but gain\nan appreciation for Islam, like what type of an engineering is there, you know, that allows for people\nto have that type of faith? So people are opening the\nQuran for the first time. People are asking questions\nabout Islam in a way that shows that they're inspired, even\nthough they're heartbroken by what they're seeing. - What's a good way to\nget introduced to Islam, the faith, the spiritual experience of it? - Well, I think, look,\nyou go to, you know, our websites, you go to\nwhyislam.org, you go to, you come to Yaqeen's\nwebsite, yaqeeninstitute.org, you go to multiple Islamic websites to get those questions answered, but there's nothing\nlike going to a mosque. There's nothing like\nactually going to a mosque and meeting Muslims and asking questions. And I tell people like,\n\"You have to step out of your comfort zone and go there and let your world be\ncomplicated a bit.\" (chuckles) Experience it, listen to the sermon, meet people from different\nbackgrounds, and ask questions. Muslims love to be asked, by the way, about their faith because they're so sick of hearing other people talk about it. So Muslims love to be\nasked about their faith. Palestinians love to be\nasked about Palestine because they're so sick of\nother people talking about it. So ask questions, and you\nwill have them answered, but there's nothing like\na physical connection, there's nothing like a human connection, so definitely try to reach out to your local Islamic\norganizations and meet people. - How difficult is it to convert to Islam? - Takes 20 seconds, man. (laughs) - Okay, (laughs) simple enough. - You testify to the one, there's no pool, there's no baptism. Like I often joke with people, I'm like, \"All right, we got the pool in the back. We're gonna do the baptism now.\" You know, it's literally\ntestifying to the oneness of God and testifying that Mohammed\nis his final messenger. And so that's called the\nShahada, and when you testify to the oneness of God and\nto the Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him,\nbeing his final prophet, you are accepting what's known\nas the Six Articles of Faith. Six Articles of Faith\nare belief in one God, belief in the angels,\nbelief in the messengers, so you can't be a Muslim without\nbelieving in Jesus or Moses or Abraham or Mohammed,\nto believe in the messages that God has spoken to humanity\nthrough divine revelation, the Quran being the last revelation, to believe in the day of judgment, and to believe in divine\ndecree and predestination. So those are Six Articles of Faith. So when you testify to the oneness of God and to the Prophet\nMohammed, peace upon him, being the final messenger,\nthat's called the Shahada. You embrace the package of\nthose articles of faith, that's the implication. Then you learn the prayers,\nlearn to fast in Ramadan. You give what's known as\nzakah, the mandatory charity, 2.5% of your retained earnings, and Hajj, which is the pilgrimage\nto Mecca, if you can. So that's the growth part, the journey. You know, once a person takes\nthe testimony, they then grow. It's really interesting because\nwe always have those people that convert to Islam like\na week before Ramadan, or even a day before\nRamadan, so you're Muslim and you gotta fast the next day, you know? And that's always a challenging\nexperience for people, but a fulfilling\nexperience for many people when they embrace Islam at that point. And again, I mean, it's simple, and I think that the beauty of Islam to many people is in its simplicity. One god, one humanity,\none body of prophets, and one community."

      "section": "Ramadan",
      "text": "- Because for you, as a\nPalestinian American, this year, the Ramadan perhaps would\nbe especially difficult, spiritually, what are you anticipating? What do you think is the\ndifference this year? - (sighs) I hope and pray\nthat we have a ceasefire before Ramadan. I hope that, at that point,\nwe're rebuilding Gaza, talking about rebuilding\nGaza and helping people that have been damaged in\nso many different ways. I hope that Ramadan is turning a corner. Every Ramadan, the aggression against the Palestinian\npeople seems to grow. So we're usually dealing\nwith, you know, last 10 nights of Ramadan, and then the\nincursions on Masjid Al-Aqsa really sour it for the\nentire Muslim world, right? 'Cause you're watching\nworshipers being assaulted in one of the holiest places in the world, and at the same time, you're trying to find\nyour deep connection, your own deep, holy\nconnection, right, in Ramadan. This time, we're going in,\nand if this is still ongoing, we're dealing with a continued genocide, so I think that the mood has\nbeen somber in the community, the mood has been different from anything I've ever seen before, so I anticipate this\nRamadan would be different from anything we've ever seen before. I think the focus will\ncontinue to be on Gaza and on either stopping\nthe aggression on Gaza or beginning the rebuilding of Gaza. - So a general heaviness\npermeates just your prayers and your thoughts throughout this? - Yeah, I mean, look,\nevery sermon I've given since October 7th has had to\nhave some inclusion of this because it's what's on\neveryone's hearts and minds. We also have people in our communities that have lost 20, 30, 40\npeople, right, in our midst. It's not the same. You know, if we start to have\nrefugees or people that escape for medical treatment or\nthat are able to get out through Egypt and join their families, you know, it's becoming more real, right? It's becoming more personal for people. So I think that Ramadan will surround, both in terms of messaging\nas well as community, the pain of the moment with a\nprayer for hope and healing. - Not to put you on the\nspot, but in your sermons, in your private life, what\nis the passage in the Quran that is one you find\nyourself returning to often? - You know, the part of the Quran, I get asked this question, that resonates with me most usually has\nto do with what is heaviest for me at the moment. There is a verse in the chapter of Mary, a part of the verse,\n(speaks foreign language) your Lord does not forget,\nyour Lord does not forget. And so, you know, as you see\nwhat's transpiring right now, our hope is not in creation,\nour hope is in our creator, and our hope is not in this life, our hope is in the afterlife. And so that verse deeply\nresonates because I think that, you know, many of us often wonder how are they gonna rebuild? How are they gonna get past this? And we know that God has a\nway of restoring everything. God will restore everything,\nif not in this life, then in the next. - So there's an eternal flame\nof hope that burns there. - Yeah, and the people of Gaza have it. The people of Gaza have it. You know, you can be more easily deluded by this material world\nif you're hostage to it, but the people of Gaza\nhave never been deluded by the material world because\nthey never really had it. They've always been\nattached to a greater idea, to a greater place, and so it is part of the secret ingredient\nthat they have, right? That they believe in\nsomething greater than this. And so you can't survive hell on earth unless you believe in\nparadise outside of it."

      "text": "- When you look far into the future, 20, 30, 40 years from now, we're doing another podcast\nin 80s and 90 years old, what do you hope to\nsee in the Middle East? What do you hope to see\nchange in the Middle East and the United States as a people, as a set of policies, cultures, nations? - I think that the nation\nstate model and nationalism are becoming so unsustainable\njust with the growth of refugee populations,\ndesperate refugee populations, the rise of, unfortunately,\nfanaticism and fascism in different parts of the world. Climate, you know, and all\nthat that presents to us in terms of displacement. We're going to have to\nfigure out how to function as a world rather than\nas nations and states. We're going to have to figure out how to not see everyone outside\nof our borders as threats, and people that are different from us, within our borders, as threats. We're gonna have to start\nseeing people as people. And so my hope would be that we would have made\npeople uncomfortable enough to transcend some of the\nbarriers in their hearts and some of the barriers\nthat we have in the world that don't allow us to see\nother people as people, and then that drives, you\nknow, horrific policies towards people that\nare so distant from us. - You have been fearless in\nwalking through the fire. What gives you strength,\npsychologically, to keep going, to speak out, but just\nalso maintain an optimism and a hope for the future? - I don't believe that\nanyone gives me success or causes me failure without\nthe permission of God. I don't seek fuel from anyone else. I don't seek hope from anyone else. I believe in a creator\nthat has a greater plan, and I want to be a\ngreater part of that plan. And I'm inspired by the\nresilience of the people of Gaza. I'm inspired by the\nresilience of my parents and our grandparents and\nPalestinians around the world that have refused to\nsuccumb to their erasure, that have refused to give up. And so we have both the\nenergy that we need, and we have the examples that we need. The energy is from above. The examples are all around us. - Well, Omar, imam, this is a huge honor to once again speak with you, and I just wanna say thank\nyou, not just for this, but for many private\nnotes you have sent me, of kindness and support and love, through some of the low points,\nfor, as silly as they are for me personally, so\nit's just great to be able to call you a friend and\nto be able to have you in my corner, it's, I'm forever\ngrateful to you for that. - I appreciate it, thank you so much, man. - And thank you for talking today.

  "full_text": "- You always know when you live in Gaza that it's only a matter of time\nbefore the next bombs drop. You know, if you're in Gaza, that you are waiting for your death. People dream about going out in the world and pursuing education. People dream about going out in the world and pursuing economic opportunity. In Gaza, your idea of\nopportunity is an opportunity to see the next year. That has been the case,\nand so when we talk about, you know, this not existing in a vacuum, if people only hear about\nGaza on October 7th, that is a major part of the\nproblem, and that is, again, part of the problem of our\nignorance and our apathy, right? Why is it that the plight\nof the people of Gaza is not brought up until an\nattack happens on Israel? - The following is a\nconversation with imam, Dr. Omar Suleiman, his\nsecond time on the podcast. He is a Palestinian American, a Muslim scholar, a civil rights leader, president of the Yaqeen\nInstitute for Islamic Research, and is one of the most\ninfluential Muslims in the world. Our previous conversation\nwas focused on Islam. This time, the focus was\non Gaza and Palestine. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description, and now, dear friends, here's Omar Suleiman. What did you think, feel, and pray for in the days that followed October 7th? - I think the first feeling was that there's going to be\na lot of death and destruction in Gaza as a result, right? We always kind of see this,\nwhere one Israeli casualty leads to hundreds of Palestinian\ncasualties, right? So, it's a pretty familiar\ncycle in some ways, where there are daily\ntransgressions against Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza, the checkpoints, the\naggression on Masjid Al-Aqsa, the settlements expanding, the\nstories of Palestinian death, and then you have rockets fired from Gaza, and that's when the\nWestern press catches up and starts to cover it. Israel responds with Hellfire missiles, white phosphorus bombs, and the casualties are\nwildly disproportionate. And so I think that, you\nknow, I wasn't surprised. I prayed for the people that I knew were going to bear\nthe brunt of this outbreak, but the outbreak was predictable. - You wrote a statement on October 9th. I was hoping to read it, if it's okay. - Yeah, go ahead. - \"Our Palestinian casualties\nare always your footnotes. The daily humiliation\nof occupation ignored. The aggression by settlers\nand soldiers alike on holy sites and souls. The annihilation of entire\nfamilies that follows. The devastation of whatever scraps remain in the open air prison of Gaza. Unsustainable and inhumane. So if you're waking up to a\nsudden interest in the region and want to know what's been happening, dig a bit deeper than two weeks and try to read beyond the headlines of a media that has been\ndehumanizing us for decades.\" - Again, this was not surprising,\nthis was very predictable. If you've been watching\nwhat's been unfolding before October 7th, 2021, Human Rights Watch\nputs out the report, \"Threshold reached, Israel\nis an apartheid state.\" Amnesty International 2022,\nthe crime of apartheid, showing how all of the\nlegal determinations of apartheid have been reached. The occupation's only\ngetting more aggressive. Shireen Abu Akleh, a\nPalestinian American journalist, is shot dead in 2022\nin front of the world. The United States says, initially, that if it is shown that\nIsrael was complicit or that Israel carried out the execution, then there will be consequences. Of course, once it was shown that Israel was indeed\nresponsible for the bullet that killed Shireen Abu Akleh, the United States did absolutely nothing. Shireen's funeral was attacked,\nthe pallbearers were beaten, her casket almost fell, and\nagain, the world is watching. The aggression against worshipers in Al-Aqsa is getting worse. You have the flag march,\nthe Jerusalem Flag March, where extremist settlers\nare let loose and wild on Palestinians by the thousands, chanting things like, \"Mohammed is dead. We're going to murder you,\nArabs,\" all with the protection of the state, with Israeli soldiers, and throughout this time, it's like, something bad is gonna happen,\nand then 2023 comes along. You had 13,000 settler units in 2023, a plan of 13,000 settler\nunits, the most in the history of the occupation, the most\nracist and extremist government, Israeli government that you have ever had, and people don't realize\nthat in 2023 alone, over 600 Palestinians\nhad already been killed. It just doesn't make Western headlines, and so if you wonder\nwhy the American public sees this so much differently\nthan the rest of the world, it's because American media shows the American public\nsomething so much different than what the rest of the world is shown. And so, this was a pressure cooker, this was going to explode,\nit is extremely predictable. You've given people absolutely no hope. And so, I think that, as\nwe're watching that, you know, it's important for us to actually\ninterrogate the ignorance that people have of\nthe Palestinian plight, the ignorance of the root\ncauses of this violence, the ignorance of the occupation, and also ask yourselves,\nyou know, why is it that Israel can violate every\nsingle international law on the books, have all\nthese determinations, and the United States keeps on issuing these inconsequential\nstatements while also, at the same time, funding\nthese aggressions? So it's like, \"Stop the settler violence,\" the United States will issue\nstatement after statement, \"Stop the settler violence,\nstop the incursions on Masjid Al-Aqsa, stop violating\nthe people in Jerusalem, stop trying to wipe out\nthe Palestinian people,\" stop openly saying, you know, that there is no two-state solution, that we will never allow\na Palestinian state to be established, but at the same time, here's your $3 billion check, and if the United Nations\nissues any sort of resolution against Israel, or if any\ninternational body tries to hold Israel accountable, the United States stands in\nthe way of any accountability. It's important for us to ask why, and so I always tell people,\nread beyond the headlines. Even now, with the backdrop of a genocide, over 30,000 people have been killed, if you open the front page of most American mainstream sites, you will see stories about the hostages, the Israeli hostages, you will see stories about October 7th, but\nOctober 8th is missing, October 9th is missing,\nOctober 10th is missing, a hundred days of genocide are missing. And you'll barely have a story that shows up every once\nin a while that, you know, is still very much so controlled by the Israeli propaganda machine because while Israel kills\nPalestinian journalists, it also makes sure that\nAmerican journalists are only able to tell a certain story. They're only able to see Gaza\nfrom a certain perspective, they're only able to speak about Gaza from a certain perspective,\nand this is well-documented, that they have to review\ntheir media tapes with Israel before they can publicize them, and so this is state\npropaganda at this point. The mainstream media and\nthe United States government are in lockstep, telling\na very skewed story, and that is leading to a\ngreater sense of frustration, and I think the American\npublic has been wronged as well by not knowing what's happening. - So you mentioned settlements. So, to you, this is bigger\nthan Gaza, it is the West Bank, it is the the Palestinian people, broadly. - Absolutely, you can't\ndisconnect Gaza from Palestine. You can't disconnect the\nWest Bank from Palestine. You can't disconnect\nJerusalem from Palestine, and you can't disconnect\nthe very human story from the political plight. You interviewed Mohammed\nEl-Kurd, you met him. What did the world do\nwhen it saw the images of the Kurd household\nbeing taken over by a guy from Brooklyn or Long\nIsland who just shows up and lays claim to their home? What did the world do when American settlers suddenly\ndecided they could walk into historic Palestinian homes and throw people out of their homes? What did the world do? And so, yes, this is\nvery much so connected to the broader issue of\nPalestinian existence. If you realize here,\nwe are erased in peace, and we are erased in war. In peace, it's the Abraham Accords, agreements between Israel\nand its Arab neighbors, which is supposedly to solve\nthe Palestinian problem. The Palestinians are\nabsent from their own fate, from discussions about their own fate. In war, it's the Israel-Hamas\nWar, it's Israel and Gaza. Where are the Palestinian people, the millions of Palestinian people, that have either been\nremoved from their land or are being tormented on their land? Where are they in this discussion? - What are the Palestinians\nin the diaspora feeling? - I think deeply frustrated. A great sense of anger, sadness. Every single Palestinian\nright now knows someone that's been killed. Every single Palestinian\nis a part of a story of displacement or destruction. Every single Palestinian has a relative that's either missing\na limb or a loved one. Every single Palestinian\nin the world is traumatized by this, and in some ways,\nbeing outside of Palestine, being away from it all, hurts even more because you see your people\nbeing killed and starved and brutalized and slaughtered, and you can't do anything about it. And the people around you are\njustifying that slaughter. If you turn on a TV, or if you\nopen a mainstream news site, these sites are justifying your slaughter. And people are being killed over there because they look like me, because they're Palestinian\nlike I'm Palestinian, and so we're watching this\nin diaspora with agony. We can't go, we can't heal our loved ones, we can't comfort the\npeople that are there. I recently spoke to a doctor\nwho's lost 75 relatives, 75 relatives in Gaza, and\nhe's a medical doctor, and all he wants to do is get in there and just use his medical\nexpertise to help his people, and he can't, and so, we're\nwatching it from afar, but our hearts are there. They are in the buildings\nthat are being destroyed, they're in the hospitals\nthat are being bombed, they are there, and they\nare with the people. - You're somebody who's always rushed into the midst of a crisis. So what does it feel\nlike on a personal level to not be able to do that\nhere, to go to Gaza to help? - Yeah, it's really hard. I mean, when any group\nof people are killed, my instinct, and I think a lot of people, is to go there to help,\nwhether it's a natural disaster or especially after an incident of terror, wherever it is, right? It's rush there and do\nthe best that you can to help people get through it. So it's been extremely hard\nto watch this from afar and feel like I can't\ndo anything about it, and so that's why, instead,\nI think that most of us are driven to continue to be\nthe voice of the voiceless. You know, I always say that\nif they've made them faceless, they can't make us voiceless. They have reduced our casualties\nin Palestine to a number. The number is hundreds a\nday, over 30,000 people. We're averaging 10,000 people a month. The fact that they've been\nturned into faceless numbers with no stories, with no humanity, makes it that much more important for us to tell their stories here,\nand to remind the world that you've lost your humanity\nif you can watch this unfold and not even have the decency\nto call for a ceasefire. I mean, that's the, that's\nwhere we've reached, that's how low it is right now. Calling for a ceasefire\nhas now become radical. So we have to remind the\nworld that if you're okay with the demolition of\nan entire town or a city or whatever it is that you wanna call Gaza 'cause it wasn't always the Gaza Strip, but if you're okay with this, and you're okay with this\ncasualty count every single day, it's not just them who are being killed, it's your hearts that are dying. And I think that when I look back to Dr. Martin Luther King\nJr., and I mentioned this, he wrote about Vietnam. He said that if America was to succumb to its spiritual death, the\nautopsy would read Vietnam. I would say that it would read Gaza now. - Speaking of the people,\nthe faces, the voices, one of the people you've talked\nabout, you've posted about, you've written about is Wael Al-Dahdouh, him being hospitalized. He's a Palestinian journalist\nand the bureau chief of Al Jazeera in Gaza City. What can you tell me about this man? - If Wael Al-Dahdouh wasn't Palestinian, he'd be on the cover of\nTime Magazine right now. He would be the most celebrated\njournalist in the world. Wael Al-Dahdouh is from Gaza. He has been in Israeli prisons, he has been under Israeli airstrikes, he has seen the worst of the occupation before he's seen the worst\nof the genocide while on TV. I mean, and this is insane\nwhen you think about it. We have over a hundred\njournalists now, right? That's more than any conflict in history that have been killed, and\nthere is sufficient evidence by international watchdogs\nthat this is intentional, that journalists have\nbeen killed intentionally, but then their families,\nWael was reporting on TV when an airstrike hits his wife,\ntwo kids, and a grandchild. He goes to the scene, and he said this, \"You know, you never\nexpect as a journalist to be the subject of the story.\" Suddenly, the camera's on him\nmourning over his dead wife and kids and grandkid, and\nhe's saying, he even says it in Arabic, he says, \"They're\ntaking it out on our children. They're taking it out on our children.\" You know, I've heard\nthis from multiple people that have had relatives targeted that, \"I wish it was me instead.\" He gets back on camera the same day because he feels a\nresponsibility to continue to cover the lives of the people of Gaza. He understands that his story,\nas devastating as it is, is not unique in regards\nto the people of Gaza, that there are many people whose families have been\nkilled in airstrikes. All two million people have\nbeen traumatized in some way. And so he gets back on\ncamera, tells the story again, and then he is targeted himself. His arm struck, his\ncameraman, Samer Abudaqa, dies in front of him. He bleeds out, Wael watches\nhim bleed out for hours, and while any aid workers try\nto reach them in the building that they were in, snipers\nwould shoot all of those that were rushing to Samer,\nso he watches his cameraman and one of his best\nfriends bleed out to death. Wael goes to the hospital,\nhis arm is wrapped up, gets treatment, he's back\non camera the next day. A few weeks later, another\nchild is killed, again, with his friend in a car, so\nthis was a targeted airstrike. His son is driving, and\nhis son and his best friend are hit in an airstrike. Wael leads the funeral prayer,\nis back on camera again and speaks with such dignity,\nwith such compassion. You know, one of the things\nthat always gets to me as a Palestinian, right,\nand as a Muslim too, is that we are portrayed to\nbe these beasts and savages. Tell me a man that would be put through what Wael was put through and\nstill stand on that pulpit and in front of the\nworld with such dignity, with such grace, continues\nto tell the story. Wael has become a hero to many of us, and he would be a hero in a world that wasn't anti-Palestinian,\nand unfortunately, Wael has not only lost his family, he's not only lost much\nof his own existence, but Wael is part of the\ngreater story of erasure. So even though he's telling the\nstory of the people of Gaza, and he is the story of the people of Gaza, most people will never\nlearn about Wael Al-Dahdouh. - You have posted videos and\nwritten about what is happening in Gaza since October 7th. What has been happening\nthere, the individual stories and the broader impact on\nthe two million people there. - Gaza been described as the world's largest\nopen-air prison, unemployment, blockaded from all directions, no airport, regular added restrictions placed even on their ability to fish. So every aspect of Gazan life\nhas been under occupation. I would argue that it's an injustice to even call it an open-air prison because inmates are not\nbombed in prisons routinely by the most sophisticated\nweapons in the world. Regular bombardment of\nGaza, every single person in Gaza has lived through\nmultiple rounds of bombardment. It is deeply distressing. You know, I remember, in 2021, there was an image that\nI will never forget of children having to go back to school after the bombardment of 2021. And next to them, they\nwould have the empty chairs and the posters of the child\nthat used to sit in that chair. I think what encapsulates it most for me, an image that I grew up with was the image of Mohammed al-Durrah, who\nwas in his father's lap over 20 years ago, and\nhis father was begging for Israel to spare his child, and Mohammed was murdered in his lap. And you know what\nhappened this last round? His other kids were murdered. So Mohammed's brothers were murdered, and his father's been on the run. Every single person in Gaza\nhas witnessed multiple wars, has witnessed the greatest\nsuffocation of occupation, has even had their diets restricted, and has suffered under\nIsrael state policy, which is called \"mowing the lawn.\" And everyone should look this up. This is what Israeli ministers refer to as routine bombardment of\nGaza, \"mowing the lawn,\" which shows you that before\nthey called us animals, they considered us insects. And unfortunately, the casualty counts get higher and higher every time, and people become more and more desperate, more and more helpless. Gaza has been, unfortunately,\nthe worst manifestation of anti-Palestinian bigotry. It's already, I mean,\n60% of the population is a refugee population. What that means, and people\ndo need to understand this, is that people move to\nGaza from other parts of occupied territory to find refuge, and were practically living\non top of each other. There are people that\nare in the Gaza Strip that know that they had homes right beyond that apartheid wall, and those homes were stolen from them, and they can't even enter\nthat territory anymore. And they know that on the\nother side of that wall, there's life, on the\nother side of that wall, there's opportunity, on the\nother side of that wall, you have a passport, you have an airport, you have the ability to travel, you have the ability to export and import. You can dream, but behind that wall, you are to live until the next airstrike, you are to live until\nIsrael mows the lawn again and hope that you're\nnot part of the grass. That's what Gaza has\nbeen all of these years. - So pragmatically and psychologically, it's very difficult to flourish when you're just waiting\nfor more bombardment. - 'Cause you know that\nit's around the corner. You always know, when you live in Gaza, that it's only a matter of time\nbefore the next bombs drop. You know, if you're in Gaza, that you are waiting for your death. People dream about going out in the world and pursuing education. People dream about going out in the world and pursuing economic opportunity. In Gaza, your idea of opportunity is an opportunity to see the next year. That has been the case. And so when we talk about, you know, this not existing in a vacuum, if people only hear about\nGaza on October 7th, that is a major part of the problem. And that is, again, part of the problem of our ignorance and our apathy, right? Why is it that the plight\nof the people of Gaza is not brought up until an\nattack happens on Israel? - I've gotten a chance to\nwitness a destroyed school in Ukraine. That's something that is\nreally difficult to see. - You have over a hundred\ndestroyed mosques. Every university in Gaza\nhas been demolished. We're seeing TikTok videos\nof Israeli soldiers laughing and singing as they press a button, and we see the demolition of every single university in Gaza. Schools have been reduced to rubble. There's a cultural genocide as well. And I want you to think about\nwhat you saw in Ukraine. Look, imagine coming\nback to school in Gaza, in some destroyed building. You're missing legs, you're missing arms, you have white phosphorus burns. Have you ever seen what white\nphosphorus does to a person? There's a reason why it's a war crime. You have white phosphorus\nburns, your mom's dead, your dad's dead, all of your\nuncles and aunts are dead, all of your siblings are dead. Somehow you got pulled out of the rubble. You know, in my own family,\nmy father's in-laws, my father remarried after\nmy mother passed away, and they're in Gaza. All of them were killed in an airstrike except for an elderly aunt who somehow made it out\nof the rubble a day later. If you're a child that's been\npulled out of the rubble, what are you gonna grow up with? I mean, what are you supposed to feel? What are you supposed to think? And then you have, you\nknow, racist commentators that say they could have\nturned that into a Singapore. You know, the Palestinians are the authors of their own destruction\nbecause if they wanted to, they could have turned this\ninto a place of prosperity, but they keep on bringing\ndestruction upon themselves. So at the root of this\nis a bigotry, and again, this idea that Palestinians\nare savages, they're animals, and the only way to deal with them is to continuously mow the lawn while simultaneously\nexpanding the occupation and erasing anything that\nwas ever called Palestine and any human being that was\never called a Palestinian. - So those kids growing\nup in Gaza now, to you, they have almost no choice\nbut to have hatred for Israel? - It's human. I mean, look, any child\nthat is under that type of oppression is going\nto hate their oppressor. I don't care who you are,\nI don't care what you are, but here's my problem with\nhow that gets brought up. You're talking about the future\nof the security of Israel. Even some people that speak about it, seemingly from a place\nof being well-meaning, that say the only way that\nIsrael can have its security is to stop killing Palestinians. And so the future of Israel depends upon Palestinians not\nhating Israel so much. And so we've gotta stop\ntormenting these people so that they don't grow\nup to want to torment us. You've already decided then whose life is worth more than the other. And so, instead of\ntalking about the future of Israeli lives, why don't\nyou talk about the present of Palestinian lives? Instead of talking about\nwhether or not your state will be secure in the future, talk to me about why you're killing children now. Two-thirds of the 30,000\ncivilians are women and children. And so, we can't talk\nabout what these children are going to grow up with. We should talk about whether\nor not these children are going to grow up in the first place. And that should be what dominates\nour conscience right now and what drives our policies and what drives our emotions right now. - So when I had a conversation\nwith Elon Musk, he suggested that what Israel should do is\nconspicuous acts of kindness. So do as much positive\nthings in Gaza as possible, on a basic individual human level and at a policy level, at every level. What do you think about that? - I mean, you don't pass out\ncandy in a concentration camp, you end the occupation. And so there has to be a solution that is beyond merely acts of kindness. At the end of the day, if\nyou're occupying a people, you have to remove that occupation. Apartheid is not dealt\nwith by acts of kindness on the part of the occupying power. Apartheid is dealt with\nby ending apartheid. And so there has to be a\nlevel of accountability. It's not just acts of kindness, it's not just treating the\npeople with more dignity. It's giving them the ability\nto pursue their own dignity. There's a reason why it's called Palestinian self-determination. The United States likes to use it in all of its inconsequential statements, that we need Palestinian\nself-determination too, but the United States also\nvoted against 138 states in the United Nations to allow for Palestinian self-determination. Self-determination means I\nget to pursue my own course of worth, I get to\npursue my own happiness, I don't have to depend on the\nbenevolence of my occupier. And when my occupier feels like, you know, throwing me a few more\ncrumbs, it has to end. There has to be a point\nnow where the world says, \"This is not sustainable.\" It's not just about ending\nthe present genocide. A ceasefire is the bare minimum. I think any decent human being would be calling for\na ceasefire right now, but at some point, you cease occupation, you cease apartheid because\nwhat led to the ability of Israel to carry out a genocide\nwithout any accountability was that the global arena\nhas permitted it to do so, largely due to American\nobstruction of justice. - Is violence an effective\nmethod of resistance? - So, the framework that I would propose is that Dr. King mentioned\nthat peace is not the absence of violence, it's the presence of justice. And so occupation and\napartheid are violent, even in their most\nbenevolent manifestations. The default of occupation\nis that it is unjustified. The default of apartheid\nis that it is unjustified, and it must be dealt with. The default of resistance\nto occupation and apartheid is that it is justified, but\nthere can be transgressions even in resisting occupation\nand apartheid, right? And I come to this from\nan Islamic perspective. My moral framework is Islam. The Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, was outraged when he saw a\nwoman or a child that was dead from the other side, the\nside of his persecutors. And so, yes, you know, we\nhave a saying, as Muslims, that they are not our teachers. Our oppressors are not our teachers, but the concept of\nresistance to occupation, it is morally justified, it is justified by international law. Any occupied people have the\nright to defend themselves. We talk about Israel's\nright to defend itself. Israel is the occupier. Any occupied people, by\ninternational law, have the right to defend themselves, and\nany occupation is unjustified and illegal, and so\nthat's where I start from, that's the point that I come to this with. I think that the problem\nis, is that the Palestinians are told, \"Find better ways to resist,\" and then they are demonized when they try to find\nany other way to resist. You know, if you go back a few years ago, you had the Great Return March. People in Gaza marched to the wall in what was one of the\nmost inspiring protests or demonstrations that I had ever seen. Marched to the wall, non-violent protest, and snipers took out their legs. AP actually documented that\nIsraeli snipers had knee counts, where you had an Israeli\nsoldier that would say, \"I took out 45 knees.\" They actually had to register\na scroll of knee counts, and so you have all these kids in Gaza walking around without legs now because they were targeted by snipers when they marched to the wall. We're told to find methods\nof non-violent resistance, but when we boycott, when we\nlaunched, you know, boycotts around the world in response\nto this transgression, in response to this ongoing oppression that the world powers have\nshown either the inability or the unwillingness to rein in, we're told that that's anti-Semitic, even though it is based on\nthe South African method of bringing an end to the\napartheid regime there. So don't respond with violence,\ndon't respond non-violently, don't protest, don't\ntry to use people power in the face of global impotence\nat the political level. Instead, let's just keep talking about the two-state solution, and while talking about\nthe two-state solution, if you were to look at a map, under every single Israeli\nregime, conservative or liberal, whatever it is, the\nsettlements have expanded, more Palestinian land has disappeared, more Palestinians have been dispossessed, more Palestinians have been killed. And so we have these little pieces of land that keep on shrinking, and\nJerusalem keeps disappearing, and there's aggression, whether Palestinians are resisting or not, but then we're told, \"Why can't you people just pursue peace? Why can't you just\nbelieve in a better way?\" All along, we're hearing Israeli ministers become far more radical and\nopen about their intentions to wipe us off the face of the earth. And that is actually their policy. It's not just slogans,\nit's not fringe elements. Actual Israeli ministers, starting from the prime minister himself, who has executed a policy of the removal of all Palestinian lands\nand Palestinian lives. And then we're told, \"Peace,\npeace, peace, peace.\" And it is awfully ugly when\nyou use the language of peace to suffocate the work of justice. You know, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., one of his early sermons was\nsomething along the lines of when peace is obnoxious,\nwhen peace is obnoxious. It was in the 1950s, around\nthe Montgomery Bus Boycott, and he talked about how this obsession with the language of peace is usually used to try to keep people in status quo and make them complacent with\ntheir miserable situation. That has been the story\nof the Palestinian people, that they've been told that\nif you do things differently, then you will find peace, but everything the\nPalestinians have tried, inside and outside, has\nbeen met with repression, the most violent forms of\nit there in Gaza and beyond. And so, look, I start from the place of wanting to see peace. I want to see a situation in which no innocent\npeople lose their lives, but we have to analyze the situation with some justice, with some fairness. What would any group of\npeople do in this situation? That doesn't mean that you hope for hell, that means that you analyze\nthe existing circumstances of hell, which was life in\nGaza even before October 7th. - That said, you did talk about\nWael Al-Dahdouh and dignity, and you mentioned transgressions. So there is places where\nviolence can go too far. - Absolutely, so violence,\nagain, the point is, is that you ask yourself\nwhy we've been silent about the violence all of this time. And you know what? When people say, \"Well, what about this? Well, what about that?\" My response is this. What I would love to see is\neffective international bodies of justice being able\nto rein in any party, that has committed an act of aggression or committed an act of injustice,\nand hold them accountable. Any reasonable human being\nwould say, \"Yeah, you know what? There should be effective\ninternational bodies that can rein in parties that can't be reined in domestically, that could stop the violence, that could assign blame properly, and then have methods of accountability.\" The problem is, is that Israel\nhas been made invincible in the international arena\nbecause of the United States. And then we wonder why there's such a rise in global anti-American sentiment. It's not because of American freedom, it's because America is\ndirectly participating. The United States government\nis directly participating in the worst genocide\nthat we have ever seen in our lives, right? Playing out onscreen, you\nknow, on social media, and we can't do anything about it. So I think that the point is, is that we need those\ninternational bodies, we need methods of\neffective accountability. And I would love to see\nblame properly assigned and anyone that kills\nany innocent human being taken to account, anyone that is guilty of a\nwar crime taken to account. We have to ask ourselves, why\nis it that Israel has violated over 63 United Nations resolutions, has expanded its occupation, has killed over 600\nPalestinians before October 7th, why is it that Israel\ncannot be held accountable? And so when you talk about, you know, words that get thrown around,\nyou know, that are used to justify violence against\nmore innocent people. You know, when I'm asked about terrorism, is it only terrorism if\nit's a non-state actor? If someone's sitting inside\na room, you know, of suits and can press a button and\nterrorize thousands of people and murder innocent people\nwith no consequences, how is that not terrorism? So if terrorism is only to be\nassigned to non-state actors, then it's a word without function. In fact, it's a word that\njustifies more terror that is then rained upon\ninnocent populations. We have to have more consistency. Children should not be killed. Non-combatants should not be targeted. We can all agree upon that. Why aren't there proper\ninvestigative bodies and then proper international\nbodies of accountability then that can execute their findings in a way that makes the\nworld a better place, in a way that actually\nbrings about more peace? And so, you know, I think this\nis where we're at right now, and this is the frustration,\nand this is the place that the Palestinians have been left. - To you, violence becomes terrorism when women and children,\nnon-combatants, are killed, no matter who is doing the killing. - Absolutely, absolutely. - In America, for you,\nfor other Palestinians, other Muslims in your community, what has all of this been like? - It feels like there's a\nreturn to some of the days after 9/11, the dehumanization, the feeling of complete\ndisregard for our humanity at the level of government,\nat the level of media, feeling of an increase in surveillance, the feeling in an increase in bigotry. People are losing their jobs,\nand people are being berated on campuses, in grocery stores,\nand people are being killed. You know, I went to the\nfuneral of a six-year-old boy who was killed directly due to\nanti-Palestinian propaganda. And so I think that a lot\nof us are feeling a return to that, but we also refuse\nto be cornered into a position where we are told to perpetually\ncondemn acts of violence and not speak about the violence that's committed against\nus here or abroad. - Can you tell the story of\nthis boy, Wadea al-Fayoume? He's a six-year-old\nPalestinian American boy who was stabbed 26 times in his home in Plainfield Township, Illinois. It was found to be a hate crime\nmotivated by Islamophobia. And the attacker said,\n\"You Muslims must die.\" - So before Wadea was killed, Wadea was killed on a Saturday. It was the immediate\nSaturday after October 7th. I remember, on Friday,\nmedia starts to reach out to every imam in the\ncountry, every Muslim leader in the country, and say,\n\"What are you gonna do about this global day of Jihad? What are you gonna do about\nthe global day of Jihad?\" It's like, \"What are you talking about?\" It's like, \"Well, Hamas has called for a global day of Jihad, so\nhow are you gonna stop Muslims from attacking people,\" right? So it's Friday, and I'm like, \"Well, this is the first\nI'm hearing from you.\" And I remember responding\nto a local reporter. Most people I just ignored. I responded to a local reporter. I said, \"I've got people in my community that have already lost 10,\n15 relatives at that point. Now it's 20, 30, and\nyou haven't said a word, and now you're reaching out to me about the potential violence\nof Muslims in America? This is great, this is\njust like 9/11, right?\" What are you gonna do to\nrestrain you angry Muslims from responding to\nwhat's happening overseas and responding to the call\nof a global day of Jihad? Guess what? That night, this man\ntakes out a military knife and attacks a six-year-old boy, a six-year-old Palestinian boy. By the way, it gets worse the\nmore details that you know. And I recently had a chance\nto go and speak to his mom 'cause she was in the\nhospital and I was there for the funeral, so I\nhad a chance to visit her not too long ago. - And she was attacked also. - She was attacked first. It was actually their landlord. So Hanan, the mother,\nwas at home with Wadea, six-year-old boy. Landlord comes in, and\nwith absolutely no emotion, just charges at her, starts with her. She was able to fight him\noff, stabbed her, initially, seven or eight times with\na military-grade knife. She fought him off, escaped to call 911, and while she is calling\n911, she hears Wadea. Wadea ran up to the man,\ncalling him Uncle Joe because the landlord, prior to\nthat, had been kind to them. Used to give Wadea toys. Wadea had an infectious, beautiful smile. Every picture you see of that kid, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful smile. And so Wadea runs up to\nhim, says, \"Uncle Joe.\" He runs up to him to give him a hug even though he's carrying\na military-great knife with blood on it 'cause\nWadea doesn't believe that harm can come to him from that man. And Hanan didn't think that he\nwould do anything to her kid, even in that fit of rage. The last thing that she\nsays she heard was, \"Oh no.\" You know Wadea says, \"Oh no.\" And then he starts to stab him 26 times, says, \"You Muslims must die.\" Usually, in a scene like\nthat, police are hesitant to classify something as a hate crime. It was classified as a hate\ncrime the very same day. The thing is, is that who's\ncomplicit in that hate crime? What filled that man's\nhead for him to believe that he was doing an act of good by murdering a six-year-old\nPalestinian boy? And in reality, Uncle Joe was motivated by President Joe Biden, who\nrepeated a debunked report that there were 40\nbeheaded Israeli babies. And he said, \"I saw 40\nbeheaded Israeli babies.\" The White House walked it back afterwards in a statement\nthat no one reads because it was factually\nfalse, but Uncle Joe heard it and had been binge-watching media about these violent\nPalestinians, and suddenly, the propaganda overcame his own humanity and what he knew of that family, and he went in and ruined their lives. And you know, now, you\nknow, just like any mom, you know, she hasn't moved a thing. His bike is still in\nthe same place it was. Toys are still in the same place. She's left with this great\nvoid, this great emptiness. If that was the only\ncrime, it would be enough to wake this country up and say, \"Oh no, this is not where we need to go.\" Oh no, right? The last thing she heard\nhim say was, \"Oh no.\" If that was it, and I\ngot the news, by the way, when I was, ironically, at a protest, we were protesting on\nSaturday, Downtown Dallas. And I started getting all these texts about what happened in Chicago. Oh no, right? Like, no Muslims attacked anyone. The media was in a frenzy\nover the global day of Jihad. I got called by national news outlets and local news outlets, \"What\nare you gonna do about Muslims that are gonna turn into monsters and start killing people in the streets?\" Next thing we know, we have a dead six-year-old\nPalestinian boy. Went to his funeral,\nand that kind of speaks to the proximity part of things. Yeah, it felt like stepping\ninto Gaza, right, for a moment. It didn't feel like America,\ndidn't feel like America. It felt like stepping into Gaza. His casket was wrapped\nin a Palestinian flag. There was not just sadness at his funeral, but a deep sense of anger. At the funeral, some of his\nfamily members shouted out, \"Joe Biden, you did this,\nJoe Biden, you did this.\" And, you know, I remember, the next day, it was right after the funeral,\nlooking at the front page of CNN, and the story of Wadea was buried in the last section, and it was right over all\nthese meaningless ads. And I thought to myself, \"That's it.\" Like if this was an\nArab man, let's be real, let's be honest here, if this\nwas a Palestinian landlord that stabbed a six-year-old\nJewish boy to death, this would have gotten more attention. It would've been the\nfront page of the news, and rightfully so,\npeople would have grieved over the insanity of stabbing\na six-year-old boy 26 times. Wadea became an afterthought\nthe very next day. And so it's an extension of the bigotry, an extension of the racism, and there's so much\nthat happens after that. There's the terrible stabbing of a Detroit synagogue\npresident, Samantha Woll, and it's horrible. She was stabbed in her driveway. Immediately, front page\nof all the news outlets, immediately, it's the main\nnews story, and immediately, the implications are,\n\"There go the Muslims, the Palestinians have lost their minds. The Muslims have, they are who\nwe thought they were,\" right? That's what it is, they are\nwho we thought they were. They went and they stabbed\na synagogue president. It turned out it wasn't a hate crime, although it was an awful crime. It turned out it wasn't a hate crime. Wadea is an afterthought. I had people reach out to me afterwards, expressing condolences,\nand I responded to them, those who have justified\nthe genocide in Gaza, but that were somehow offering\ncondolences for Wadea, privately, of course. You know, by the way, if a Muslim would've committed that crime, every single Muslim\nleader would've had press in front of their door\nto condemn that crime. We would've all been made complicit. Had people reach out to me, say, \"I'm sorry about what happened\nwith Wadea, it's terrible. You know, I saw you at the\nfuneral, praying for you.\" My response was, \"What's the difference between Wadea and a boy in Gaza? What's the difference\nbetween me and Wadea?\" I'm a Palestinian child. My parents made it out of Palestine. I was born in this country. If I didn't have the\nopportunity to grow up here and to become the person that I became, you would've been justifying\nmy murder right now. You would've been okay with my genocide. You would've been giving\nthe talking points to the press to erase\nme, but you feel sorry because Wadea was killed? And I think this is when we say that anti-Palestinian\nbigotry is an extension of Islamophobia. If a mosque gets targeted here, people rightfully rush\nto protect that mosque, and say, \"This is horrible,\nand it shouldn't happen.\" But when you have an Israeli\nsoldier bombing a mosque and laughing like a maniac on video, and it's going viral on TikTok, and there is no way to rein that in, and you don't have a word\nof condemnation about it, in fact, you are standing\nin the way of a ceasefire, then you're a hypocrite. There's no way around\nit, you are a hypocrite. What's the difference\nbetween a mosque here and a mosque there? What's the difference between\na Palestinian life here and a Palestinian life there? If you're okay with me\nbeing murdered there, don't say that you care\nabout my life here. And so that hypocrisy has been laid bare. We have said multiple times, \"Masks are falling, masks are falling.\" People that we thought were decent people somehow have found it in\nthemselves to justify a genocide. There is no shortage, at\nthis point, of videos. And again, when you, you know,\nI could have made the excuse for you maybe in the\nfirst few weeks, you know, that you hadn't seen enough, but with all social media\nsuppression across all platforms, there isn't a single platform that hasn't suppressed Palestinian voices, with all that suppression,\nthere are enough videos at this point of children whose\nheads have been blown off, of children walking around without limbs, of parents carrying their kids in bags, not body bags, I mean grocery bags 'cause they don't even have\nbody bags, and screaming out and saying, \"Why are you doing this to me? Make it stop.\" And you come back and\nyou tell that person, \"It's Hamas' fault.\" Where's your humanity? Where is your sense of decency? Isn't that the logic of\nthe so-called terrorism that you condemn? Yeah, well, you can wipe\nout entire populations. You should have talked to Hamas. It's Hamas' fault. All the kids in the West Bank\nall like, where does this end? So what's your, what are your\nmoral boundaries here, right? So if that's the logic\nthat you're okay with, then, in that case, when there's\na mass shooter in a school in the United States, just\nbomb the whole school. In fact, bomb the whole town if you can't find the\nmass shooter, you know? Where does this end for you, right? And so when I say people\nhave lost their humanity, they're killing us overseas,\nbut their hearts are dying. People have lost their humanity. They've lost any sense of morality and their moral boundaries,\nand being there, and, I mean, participating in\nthis funeral, it was anger. I'm not used to that,\nI'm not used to that. You know, I'm an imam, I pastor to people. I went to Christchurch, and that was the worst\nI'd ever seen before, where 50 Muslims were killed\nby a white supremacist. And he murdered them\nwith such callousness, and I remember being at those funerals, and yeah, I mean there was anger, but it was just profound sadness because at least the rest of\nthe world could all come out in one voice and say, \"That's wrong.\" Now most of the world sees\nwhat's happening in Gaza and says, \"This is disgusting.\" Most of the world sees this\nand says, \"This is a genocide.\" But we happen to live in this bubble here, where we're constantly being\ntold we did this to ourselves. And that's the same logic that led to our initial expulsion, 1948. What was the crime of\nthose 700,000 Palestinians that were driven out\nof their home in 1948? What did they do? They didn't do, they did\nnot commit the Holocaust, they didn't have a mass\nmurder of Jews at their hands. What did they do? What crime were they paying for? And so it's been the consistent theme. This is the story of our\npeople, not since October 7th. This is the story of our\npeople for the last 75 years. - There is a deep geopolitical connection between the United States\nand that part of the world. What is the role of US\npoliticians in all of this? - You know, James Baldwin wrote\nabout how Israel was created as an extension of United States policy to be a colonial entity at\nthe gates of the Middle East. And to function essentially\nas a military base out there and as a means of extending\nits policy, you know, throughout the Middle East,\nand it has functioned as such. The United States is not\nan honest peace broker. It never has been an honest peace broker. The United States has never\nshown any meaningful inclination towards peace, has guarded\nand protected Israel from international accountability, has made Israel invincible. The United States is not just responsible at the governmental\nlevel for the genocide, it's responsible for\nletting it get to this point in the first place. We have funded that arsenal. We've given them the most\nsophisticated weapons in the world to test on the most desperate\npopulation in the world. We've given them the weapons. It's been bipartisan. We have issued, at most,\ninconsequential statements of condemnation, but at the same time, stopped any international body of law from actually holding it accountable. So the United States, at\nthis point, unfortunately, has rightfully lost all credibility. It should remove itself from this because it is not an honest peace broker. I think Americans are probably\nsick of us paying for wars in general. I think Americans are probably sick of our tax dollars going\nto funding a genocide. While we have a rise of homelessness and income disparity here\nin the United States, I think that Americans\nprobably don't like that. We're making ourselves so\ndeeply unpopular in the world because of Israel's actions. So in the immediate\nmoment, make this stop. The United States could\nhave had a ceasefire a long time ago. The United States could have\nended this genocide right away. The reason why this is continuing is because of US foreign\npolicy, and in the process of Joe Biden talking\nabout managing this crisis and talking about making things better, there have only been more bills that have come out of Congress. In fact, he's bypassed\nCongress to fund the arsenal, to keep replenishing the arsenal. Stop paying for weapons, stop paying for someone else's war crimes, stop protecting another country as it commits these war crimes. And if you can't be an\nhonest peace broker, get out of the process. - So there's money that you\njust mentioned and bills, and then there's rhetoric,\nwhich you also criticized, that he spoke about the beheaded babies and things of that nature. So where has Joe Biden fallen short? - Yeah, we need another podcast. That's gonna take a few hours to talk about where Joe Biden has failed. For one, the first time he seemed to find the word Palestinian\nin his vocabulary was when he accused the Palestinians of lying about the death toll in Gaza, and then that turned out to also be false. In fact, the numbers that were coming out of the Gaza Health Ministry, according to multiple\ninternational bodies, have been under-reporting\nPalestinian casualty counts. Israeli intelligence has\nsaid that the civilian count or the death toll is actually higher than what's been coming out\nof the Gaza Health Ministry, so he's failed on that front. He has failed to speak\nto Palestinian humanity. He has spoken with deep\npassion and concern, as has Antony Blinken, about, you know, the devastation in Israel and the way that people\nare feeling in Israel, and has shown nothing of that\nsort towards Palestinians. We don't want the rhetoric, we really don't want the rhetoric. You know, when people say,\n\"Call for a ceasefire,\" the United States has had an opportunity and has an opportunity to really walk back and reflect on its entire\npolicy towards Israel-Palestine. This is a moment of reflection. This is a moment of restoration\nif you want it to be, right? And to think about what we've\nenabled in the first place. He's shown absolutely no real empathy. And I think that he is\nunder great delusion in thinking that the Muslim community or people of conscience\nare gonna forgive this, are gonna forget this come November. You can't tell us that. Well, at least I don't\nhave the Trump Muslim ban while also carrying out a\ngenocide primarily against Muslims and think that the Muslims\nare still gonna vote for you. And so we will make him\nhear us at the polls, and any politician, for\nCongress or otherwise, that has not called for a ceasefire, that has been a part\nof this dehumanization, we will make sure that\nwe see support for them in any way as a community. It's only right. - So Biden has lost or is losing\nthe hearts and the support of the Muslim, Palestinian people and the Muslim people in America. - I don't know if he ever had the hearts of the Muslim community,\nto be honest with you. I mean, I personally was\nnever a Joe Biden fan. I think a lot of people felt the same. You know, this country\nunfortunately leads to the, the way that our political system is built is that you're always\nvoting for the lesser of the two evils. That's always the way that it is. It's analyzing which evil is lesser, right?\n- Yeah. - And when people say, \"If\nyou vote for Donald Trump,\" and I'm not planning to vote\nfor Donald Trump either, but if you don't vote\nfor Joe Biden, right, if you don't vote for Joe Biden, right, then you are destroying democracy. I'm like, a democracy\nthat's given us a choice between Donald Trump and Joe Biden is already a failed democracy. And so, he never had the hearts and minds of the Muslim community. People always saw past his rhetoric. He always has had a terrible\ndisposition towards Palestine. He's always had a terrible disposition towards the Muslim world. You know, his segregationist\npast comes out sometimes when he starts talking\nabout the Muslim world, and you can hear the racism in his voice, and you can hear the way that he talks about Palestinian life\nin such devalued fashion. So he lost us a long time ago, but he's definitely not\ngetting us back after this in any way, and I can't\nspeak for all Muslims, but I think that come November, he and all of those politicians,\nespecially in swing states that have turned their backs\non the Muslim community, and not just the Muslim\ncommunity, by the way. 67% of this country wants a ceasefire. Three-fourths of Democratic\nvoters want a ceasefire. Half of Republican voters\nwant a ceasefire, right? It's not just the Muslim community. This is not some radical\nopinion to call for a ceasefire. And every single politician\nthat has refused to hear us is going to pay a price at\nthe polls, as they should. That doesn't mean that\nwe're under any illusion that the other side\npromises us anything better. In fact, it feels like\nRepublicans have simply rushed to out-racist the\nDemocrats, to outpace them in terms of talking about how they're going to be more unapologetic in supporting Israel\nunconditionally, right? Like it's been pathetic,\nbut something has to change, and I think that Americans\nof conscience have to look at how this failed political\nsystem has hurt people here and abroad, and talk about\nhow to transcend that with just more humanity. Again, when you have 67%\nof the American public that wants a ceasefire, but\nonly a handful of congressmen, out of over 500, can muster up the courage in the face of these super\nPACs to say that, you know, \"We should stop the genocide,\" right? And it's like, what are\nyou asking for here? You're asking for the genocide to stop. You're asking for Israeli\nhostages to be brought home. You're asking for Palestinian\nprisoners to be released. You're asking for peace and\nto start carving the path out to end this once and for all, right? In the most ambiguous way possible, by the way, because there aren't many radical American politicians, right? It's the way that the system is. In the most ambiguous, bare way possible, and you can't even bring\nyourself to do that. This is already a failed democracy then. All the while, again, you know,\nit always boggles my mind, if you're from the America First crew, what's America First about? Funneling billions and billions\nand billions of dollars to Israel while it\ncarries out this genocide while people are starving here. And if you're part of\nthe human rights crew and, you know, progressive\ncrew, it's, you know, they have a term called\n\"Progressive except Palestine,\" right, PEP, \"Progressive\nexcept Palestine.\" Where are all your\nnotions of social justice? You talk about policing here, but you don't talk about who\ntrains our police departments in many major cities and\nthe type of brutality that's being carried out there. You talk about human\nrights at the border here, but you don't talk about\nthe assault on people at the border there. You talk about all of these things here, but you somehow use\nthe exact same framings against the people there. So it's exposed, I think,\nthe moral bankruptcy of both political polar\nopposites that exist in this country right now, and hopefully, evoked a greater societal\nsentiment to say, \"This is ridiculous.\" You know, one of the\nthings that is happening is that more people are getting their news outside of legacy media outlets. You can't hide that many\ndead babies anymore. You just can't. More people have woken up to\nthe Palestinian plight now than ever before. More people are outraged that this has been our\nAmerican foreign policy all throughout, you know, Democratic and Republican administrations. This is what we've been paying for? This is what we've been excusing? And Israeli leaders\nliterally spit in the faces of whoever the American\npresident is, and says, \"Yeah, we don't care\nwhat they tell us to do.\" You know, American leadership\nsays we're pushing Israel to minimize the casualties\nto get less indiscriminate with its bombing, to manage the crisis, get a few more humanitarian corridors in, to make sure that that\nGaza is not evacuated and not ethnically cleansed, to make sure Palestinians can come back. And Netanyahu comes on TV and says, \"From the river to the sea.\" How ironic is that? From the river to the sea,\nand that is his policy. We're going to make sure\nthat Israel controls from the river to the sea, and we're going to push\nPalestinians into Sinai, and Muslim countries need to take them in. You have Israeli ministers,\nnational defense ministers, saying, you know, things openly, right? Like, \"We want to thin out the population, i.e., ethnic cleansing,\nwe want to remove people, and the Muslim world needs to step up and take in these refugees,\" right? And the American administration, you know, or the American president says, and American secretary\nof state says, you know, \"We're talking to them,\nand we're making sure that that's not gonna happen,\" and if one of their\nministers says something, Blinken maybe tweets out something about how that's not gonna happen, but then it happens anyway, and then we still write them the checks. So I think most of the American public is probably going to get\nsick of this at some point. Just people of decency\nand people of conscience are gonna say, \"Yeah,\nthis is not something we wanna a part of anymore.\" - Do you think there's something\nthat Donald Trump can do to help move this in the right direction? - Trump's first words were\nabout how he's gonna be worse on this, right? So he talked about how he's\ngoing to deport people, revoke visas of, you know, students that are part of these\npro-Palestinian rallies. - Also, the focus was on the rallies versus what's going on abroad. - Yeah, but look, we had\na Donald Trump presidency. He moved the embassy to Jerusalem. He was not better on this. Unfortunately, this is\na bipartisan problem. And so, again, we're\nunder no illusion here. Like we're not looking to\nDonald Trump as a savior here, but we are gonna penalize Joe Biden. And that's, you know, I\ncan't speak for everybody, but I think that that's\nwhere a lot of our minds are at right now. - You spoke at the November 4th\ndemonstration in Washington, called the Free Palestine March. It had a lot of people, several hundred thousand people there. What do you remember from that experience? - Well, the first thing I remember is that there was no news coverage of it. So 400,000 people march on DC, one of the largest marches in history. It was nowhere to be found\nin mainstream media coverage, whereas when the Stand\nwith Israel rally happened, between the 300,000-strong Palestine rally and the 400,000-strong Palestine rally, there was a Stand with Israel rally, where congressmen were bused from Congress to speak at that rally. Democrats and Republicans\nand high-profile celebrities, and it was, you know, live-streamed\nacross multiple places. I mean, I have to say this, the ICJ, if that wasn't the greatest\ndisplay of media bias in the domain of United\nStates mainstream media, then I don't know what is. They live-streamed the Israeli defense on multiple news outlets, defending itself against the case for genocide, and completely omitted the\nSouth African presentation of the crimes of Israel the day before. So what I remember, first and\nforemost, about the protest is that they were nowhere to\nbe found on mainstream media, which was expected, but\nwhat I also remember, from the actual day of, and from all of the pro-Palestine rallies, is that I have never\nseen a more multi-faith, more diverse group of people\nconsistently coming out for Palestine against the genocide in Gaza that I have this time around, and I think that has been\nthe experience all around. There has been a\npronounced Jewish presence, Jewish Voice for Peace, IfNotNow, other anti-Zionist Jewish groups, groups that are against the genocide, against the occupation,\nformer Israeli soldiers even, you know, that have been\nshowing up at these protests. There's been a pronounced presence from Native American\ngroups, Indigenous groups, all across the board, right? Christians, Jews, Muslims,\nI've never seen more diversity at these rallies than I've\nseen this time around, which I think is a sign\nof where things are going. And if you look at the\nunder-35 opinion polls, it's very clear that there's\na generational gap here, that the country is moving\ninto a more coherent direction and understanding what has\nbeen happening over there. And people from all backgrounds\nare standing up to it now. - What do you think about the protests on campus against Israel? - Every protest I've been to\nhas had the exact same tenor, has had the exact same messaging, but you always have that\nidiot or two that shows up with a sign, and no one knows\nwho that idiot is, ironically. Never comes with anybody else. Always shows up somehow in\nthe middle of the protest and puts up a sign that says\nsomething completely contrary to the messaging of the protest, then all the cameras\nshift towards that guy. I see it every single time,\nbut the overwhelming tenor of all of these protests\nhas been consistent. It's been calling for freedom, it's been calling for liberation, it's been calling for an end\nto the genocide, a ceasefire, an end to the occupation,\nan end to the apartheid. I will tell you what many\npeople are not seeing. Columbia University, two IDF\nsoldiers, former IDF soldiers, spraying Palestinian\nprotestors with skunk water, which is what the IDF uses\non Palestinian protestors and sometimes on worshipers on\ntheir way to Masjid Al-Aqsa, which has multiple health repercussions. And so I was reading about\nhow one of the students that was sprayed on campus at Columbia, Palestinian student,\nyou know, has showered, at this point of us doing this podcast, 11 times, cannot get the smell out of her, has suffered all sorts of health issues as a result of being sprayed. Again, people are not\nseeing the other side here. People are not seeing what\nwe've had to deal with at these protests, right? The open bigotry, and I want you to think about this, by the way. People go and serve in\nthe IDF and then come back to the United States\nor the United Kingdom, and they're not stigmatized\nfor participating in apartheid policies or\nparticipating in a genocide. How am I supposed to\nfeel as a Palestinian, knowing that this guy right\nnext to me participated in murdering my relatives in Gaza, right? And has open rein to\nsay what he wants to say or do what he wants to do. And so, we haven't seen the\nother side of that as well, but I'd recommend to anyone\nthat's talking about, you know, pro-Palestine\nprotests to actually go see one. If you go to the protests, you\nlisten to what's being said, and you don't just capture 'em. I mean you got 400,000 people. Don't just go try to find, you're gonna find four stupid people at a protest of 400,000 people, right? Because the protest scene is always messy. But I think that this is a sign\nof the outrage and the anger and the frustration\nthat many students have about being silenced. Again, in the media, in academic settings, professors are losing their jobs, students are having their\nfaces put on trucks, being doxed, shady watch\nlists that get put out. I'm on a few of them as well, and I just don't care anymore, right? But you got these shady watch lists. People are losing their jobs at law firms. They're losing all of\ntheir future opportunities, young Palestinian students,\nbecause of something that they tweeted that's\nbeing taken out of context 10 years ago, right, when\nthey were 17 years old. It's ridiculous, and so\nI think that, you know, we have to listen to the\noverwhelming majority of voices of people that are\ndemonstrating for justice, not demonstrating against anyone, but demonstrating for people. Again, there's a large,\npronounced Jewish presence at every single pro-Palestine march. In fact, if you look at the organizations, the groups that have\ntaken over Capitol Hill and, you know, train\nstations, it's been IfNotNow. \"Not in our Name,\" \"Never\nAgain\" means for anyone, right? It's been Jewish groups, many\nJewish anti-occupation groups that have been at the\nforefront, and I think that that's where we have to pay attention to the beauty of how diverse this movement for a free Palestine has actually been. - So the average sentiment\nis anti-occupation, not anti-Semitic. - It's incredibly lazy, incredibly lazy, to say that anti-Zionism or that anti-occupation is anti-Semitic. First and foremost, the\nPalestinians are a Semitic people. That's number one. Number two, look, I'm\nproud of my community. My community has stood\nagainst anti-Semitism in this country. The Muslim community has\nbeen at the forefront of condemning anti-Semitism. We have stood in front of synagogues, we have stood with the Jewish community when the Jewish community is attacked. This is about occupation. This is a story of a colonial entity that has driven us out of\nour homes and has done so in such a way that has forced\nus to try to be the voice of a people that are being\nexterminated overseas right now. This is not an anti-Semitic movement. This is a pro-freedom movement. - Do you think the\nprotests ever go too far? - The protest scene is a\nmessy scene, and so, again, you're gonna have\nsometimes that odd speaker or people get carried\naway in their emotions, and yes, sometimes people\nchant things or do things that are contrary to the protests. It's pretty unfair when you judge the entire protest movement by some of these incidents\nthat have happened at protests, and you don't pay attention to\nwhat they're protesting about in the first place, which is a genocide. Right now, everything is secondary to ending a genocide that is ongoing. In the course of this discussion,\nit's not an exaggeration to say that at least 30, 40\npeople would've been killed just over the last few hours because we're averaging 135 to 150 a day. So, everything else is secondary to that. This is where we all need to be right now as people of conscience. How do we stop this because every single day is deeply costly. - Do you think there has\nbeen a rise of anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hate in the US? - Yeah, I think that's factual. Look, anti-Semitism is\nalways to be condemned. It's wrong, it's something that, as a Muslim community and\nas people of conscience, we have always taken a stand against. Jewish people should not be attacked for being Jewish people\nhere or anywhere else. Synagogues should be protected,\nand if a person is attacked for being Jewish, we\nwill be the first to go and to stand with them and to\nreject that attack on them. And there has been, as I said, an inspiring pronounced Jewish presence in the movement to end the occupation. And so we're being\nmorally consistent here. As far as the rise in\nIslamophobia, it is felt, it's under-reported, and it is, you know, part of the same framing that\nhas led to the devastation of our people overseas. So there's a rise in Islamophobia, there's a rise in anti-Semitism,\nthere's a rise in hatred. All of that is true, but there's\nalso an ongoing genocide, and that should be our\npriority, right now, to end. - I think we spoke last\ntime, about a year ago, how has your view on Benjamin\nNetanyahu evolved over time? - Benjamin Netanyahu has committed himself to the erasure of Palestinian\npeople and Palestinian symbols and Palestinian land\nfrom the very beginning of his political career. This is who he has been. We just haven't been listening to him. He campaigned on bigotry and\nracism and on the promise that there would never\nbe a Palestinian state. He campaigned on the promise\nthat Gaza would be wiped out. He campaigned by saying, \"The Arabs are rushing to the polls. We need to make sure that\nthey don't infect our policy.\" He has always been this person, this has always been his policy, he has always indicated that genocide and ethnic cleansing is\nwhere he wants to go. So he's simply manifesting what\nhis message has always been, and anyone that ignores\nthat is being disingenuous. You can find statements\nfrom Benjamin Netanyahu in the 80s, 90s, 2000s. You can find him talking about\nthis prior to October 7th and after October 7th. He's definitely doing this now\nto save his political career. I think he wants to drive this\nas long as he possibly can because he knows that his\ndays in office are numbered, but let's also ask ourselves, why is it that Benjamin Netanyahu\nwas able to rise to power in the first place, right? There's something deeply\ntroubling about the fact that his messaging ever resonated\nand what the prospects are for peace if Benjamin\nNetanyahu was able to rise with such pronounced hateful messaging. - So the claim that security of Israel is the primary concern is,\nyou're saying, a dishonest claim. - I think he's trying to\nsecure his seat in office. He knows his days are numbered. This is not about Israel,\nthis isn't about the hostages for him, this isn't about\nanything but Benjamin Netanyahu. He is a narcissist, he's a tyrant, he is despised around the world. And I think even amongst Israelis, I think there's a depatriate form. I think the hostages' families\nknow that he doesn't care about the families or about the hostages, but he's driving a political agenda that doesn't care about people, not Palestinian people or otherwise. However, the problem of the occupation is not Benjamin Netanyahu. The problem of the\noccupation is the occupation. Yair Lapid was the progressive,\nmoderate alternative, and he drove just as bigoted of an agenda against the Palestinian\npeople as possible, so to the Palestinian\nthat's living in Gaza or the Palestinian in the\nWest Bank, whoever's sitting in that seat has meant the\nexact same thing to them, but Benjamin Netanyahu\nis certainly, I think, the loudest bigot that we have\nseen, you know, in that seat. - Do you think Israel has the\nright to defend its borders? - I think Israel has a responsibility to protect those that it occupies. I think you have to ask\nthat question differently. You know, Noura Erakat wrote\na tremendous article on this from a legal perspective. You know, when you talk about\nIsrael defending itself, Israel is bound to occupation law. This is the problem all along. You know, when John Kerry said,\nof course, the US is great, sometimes, at issuing\ninconsequential statements, but Israel has to choose\nwhether or not it wants to be a Jewish or a democratic state, be a Jewish or a democratic\nstate, but it can't be both. Israel wants to occupy and\ndeny, and at the same time, not be held to the standards\nof being an occupier, but be treated as if\nit's some normal state. Those borders were drawn\nacross occupied land, and have been expanding\ninto Palestinian territory, and people have been thrown out of their homes systematically\nand transgressed upon even in the places that they\nfled to, which is Gaza, right? So when you talk about\nIsrael having a right to defend itself, you should\nbe talking about Israel's duty to protect everyone under its occupation. Either lift the occupation or protect everyone under your occupation. Where are your borders, right? What is your responsibility? Who are you protecting? And I think that it speaks to the fact that Israeli policy considers\nPalestinians to be animals. They say as much, and they do as much. I've spoken about James Baldwin, and James Baldwin talked\nabout this pious silence surrounding Israel that\nwe're supposed to pretend like it's just another state, you know? And ignore how it came into\nbeing and what it functions as. And I think that pious\nsilence has to be broken. You know, I remember Jon Stewart when he had \"The Daily\nShow\" several years ago, and he talked about this\npolicy of, you know, we have to defend ourselves, and if someone was attacking\nyour home, what would you do? And the response was, \"Well,\nwhy are you forcing people into a closet?\" So you force people into\nthis desperate situation. You drive them out of their\nhomes, claim their homes, and then say that you're\ndefending yourself against them. The default is that an\noccupied people have a right to defend themselves. The occupier is obligated\nto those that they occupy. - Can you speak to this\nterm, occupation, in Gaza because the people that say\nit is not an occupation say that Israeli troops have\nbeen pulled out from there, before October 7th, for many years. - [Omar] Yeah. - And to you, it still\nis a de facto occupation. - Israel doesn't get to set\nthe terms and then define them. It is an occupation according\nto any legal standard, international legal standard. Israel controls the movements\nof everyone in Gaza. It controls the air and the seas. It controls the ability\nto import or export. The people that live in Gaza\nand the people that live in the West Bank, the Palestinians, have had their identity stolen from them. So there's the freedom of movement, there is the freedom of thriving, there is self-determination, all of that has been stolen\nfrom the people of Gaza. There's no airport in Gaza. That was destroyed by Israel as well. It is an occupation at every level, and by any meaningful legal determination. - What do you think about\nYemen's Houthi rebels attacking Israel in\nresponse to October 7th, and then the United States\nand the UK initiating bombing of multiple targets in\nYemen in response to that? - Yeah, I think that it's clear that the United States cares\nmore about its shipping lanes than it does about Palestinian lives, and that actually has proved it. Look, I do not support\nthe Houthis as Houthis or their policies in general, but if you look at what has transpired and what they have said,\nthey're attacking these ships in response to the occupation\nor in response to the genocide and saying that they\nwill continue to do so to stop business as usual\nuntil a ceasefire is reached. They have not killed anyone, right? They have ceased ships,\nthey have blocked the lanes, but they have said that\nif a ceasefire happens, they will cease their activity. So instead of the United States trying to get a ceasefire through, the United States decided,\n\"Let's go bomb Yemen too.\" You know, let's spend\nmore money on weapons and killing innocent people,\nwhich shows you exactly where our policy always leads\nitself to, unfortunately. So I think that most\nreasonable people would say that the problem is not with\nYemeni rebels attacking ships. The problem is with Israel attacking innocent Palestinian lives. - You mentioned paying\nrespects to the legacy of EBJ, Eddie Bernice Johnson, and remembering Palestinian\nchild prisoners. Can you explain? - So Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson was one of the few co-sponsors of a bill that has been on the floor\nof Congress for years, initially sponsored by\nCongresswoman Betty McCollum, to penalize Israel for its\ndetention of child prisoners. Thousands of children\narbitrarily detained, put in military courts,\nsolitary confinement, and yes, sexual violence,\nthat's been documented by human rights\norganizations, against them, and there have been no repercussions. So I want you to think about this. You know, just the thought of\nconditioning aid to Israel, you know, so that it doesn't\nindiscriminately bomb entire populations has not\nbeen able to find any home in mainstream American politics for years. Just trying to stop Israel\nfrom picking up children and throwing them into military prisons, where they disappear for decades at times, has not found any thrust in\nmainstream American politics, whereas any resolution that is pro-Israel will make it past both\nchambers relatively quickly. When people talk about Israeli hostages and then talk about Palestinian prisoners, there's already a problem\nwith that framing. First of all, all 2.2 million\npeople in Gaza are hostages. Every Palestinian that lives\nunder occupation is a hostage, but all of those prisoners\nthat have been picked up, women, children, innocent people, with absolutely no process of making sure that they're treated right\nor given fair trials, or even given a communication\nline with their families or with any government to help\nthem, is absolutely criminal. All of those prisoners are also hostages. And when you already propose this idea that there are Israeli hostages\nand Palestinian prisoners, you're already implying\nthat one group is complicit in their own devastation,\nwhereas another group has had devastation visited upon them entirely out of their own doing. And so it's important for people to learn about children\nprisoners, who are indeed hostages to an apartheid system,\nand even what happened during that four-day truce, which all of us hoped would be extended and become permanent, where 150 Palestinian\nprisoners were released. Israel just went and picked up another 135 in the West Bank and\nthrew them in prisons. That's what I mean when I say you're not addressing\nthe root of the problem. The root of the problem is the occupation. The root of the problem is the apartheid. The root of the problem is the desperation that then drives the creation\nof all sorts of circumstances that will only further lead to the devastation of everyone, right? If you don't solve that\nproblem, and at the root of that problem is the\ndehumanization of the Palestinian, because no one is raising alarms for those Palestinian hostages\nin Israeli military prisons, no one's putting up their pictures, and no one's talking about who they are and their human stories, and the violence that's been wreaked against\nthem at every level. So if you don't solve, not\njust the root of occupation, but also the dehumanization\nthat drives the occupation, which is, unfortunately,\nso pervasive right now in the discourse, then\nyou're going to continue to have this gap in how\nthe world sees the plight of the Palestinians\nand how, unfortunately, the American public sees the\nproblem of the Palestinians. - And to you, big peace agreements like, of the like of Abraham Accords\nshould include Palestine. - Abraham Accords is\nnothing but an agreement in which you slap the name\nof Abraham on arms deals. In exchange for countries being able to undertake their own unholy pursuits, they use one of the\nholiest names in history and continue to erase the\nmain victims of this atrocity. And so the Abraham Accords\nare an insult to humanity, an insult to the Palestinians, and an insult to the name of Abraham. - But do you think something like that, agreements of that nature, of that scale, could be made that include\nthe Palestinian people, and that would actually make progress? - If they're honest to the\nplight of the Palestinians, if they are honest to the roots\nof the problem, absolutely. Look, again, peace is sought, but peace cannot be used to silence. The entire peace process has, you know, been hung over the\nPalestinians all of these years while settlements continued to expand and their situation only\ncontinued to get worse. Is Israel really going\nto remove the 700,000, 800,000 settlers, right,\nand suddenly changes tune on a two-state solution? Benjamin Netanyahu is saying right now, and he's speaking to, unfortunately, what is clearly a majority\nof the Israeli public, that there will never\nbe a Palestinian state. So these peace talks cannot be used to suffocate all of the work of justice and bringing Israel to accountability. The world has to act\nwhen they see apartheid. The world has to act\nwhen they see occupation. If the world fails to bring Israel to a place of accountability, then a few countries that\nhave their own agendas cannot put forth anything\nmeaningful for the victims of Israel being the Palestinian people. - There's a lot of\nquestions I wanna ask you about the nature of resistance, and what is the proper way to resist? What is the practical, pragmatic, effective ways of resisting? So one example that is often\nbrought up is the difference between MLK and Malcolm X. One emphasized non-violent resistance, the other emphasized\nany-means-necessary resistance. Which do you side with, in general and in this particular\ncase of what has happened over the past a hundred-plus days? - So, in general, that framing\nrelies on a sanitization of Dr. Martin Luther King\nJr. and a vilification of Malcolm X that a lot of\npeople do put forth and present as two polar opposites in how\nthey approached the plight of Black people in America and resisting racism here in America. When I taught a course at\nSouthern Methodist University on MLK and Malcolm X, and Islam and the civil rights movement, what I'd often do is I'd give\nmy students a set of quotes, and I would say, \"Assign\nthis to Malcolm or Martin,\" and they'd always get it wrong, right? So you can find, you know, quotes from MLK and breaking the silence, and especially when he took a\nstand against the Vietnam War, that sound so radical, you\nknow, when you compare them to the image of MLK, and\nMalcolm is, of course, turned into this militant, angry Muslim who just wanted violence and was seeking chaos\nhere in the United States. So let's be clear about something here, that Malcolm never himself\nwas part of any violence. Malcolm never did anything violent. Malcolm found it hypocritical\nto commit the oppressed people to non-violence while not\nrestraining the oppressor from its violence, and\nI agree with Malcolm. It is absolutely hypocritical\nto focus your attention and your energy on the oppressed people and committing them to non-violence while not directing your\nattention to the oppressor. When you have such asymmetry, when you have a clear\naggressor and aggressed-upon, you have a clear colonial entity and a clear colonized\npeople, you focus your energy on restraining the colonial power, you focus your energy on\nrestraining the oppressor, not the oppressed, and so\nthat was Malcolm's point, and it's clear in his messaging, throughout his religious growth, because, of course, Malcolm\ndid evolve as a person, but Malcolm found it deeply hypocritical to commit the oppressed to non-violence. Malcolm also had a deep\nunderstanding of the way that brutality here, state\nviolence in the United States, was connected to its state violence abroad and American imperialism as a whole. Malcolm was the first to speak on Vietnam, the first major African American\nleader to speak on Vietnam. Martin followed. Malcolm also went to Gaza in 1964. 1964, went to Khan Yunis, which is now under heavy bombardment, and Malcolm penned an essay on Zionism and connected Zionism\nto American imperialism and the broader implications\nof America's foreign policy. So Martin and Malcolm, if you look at them in the capacity of what's\nhappening right now, where I would say you can find something that is deeply profound, James Cone wrote a book\ncalled \"Malcolm and Martin, Dreams and Nightmares.\" And he wrote something\nprofound to the effect that Martin tried to liberate white people from their own racism,\nwhereas Malcolm tried to liberate Black people from the effects of that racism on them. And so they both played\na deeply important role. Self-determination is\ncrucial to maintain the fuel of a movement, and I\nthink one of the things that probably deeply frustrates those that have sought the erasure of Palestine is that Palestinian\nconsciousness has only continued to grow after 75 years. Palestinians in diaspora and Palestinians within\noccupied territory, all are deeply rooted in\ntheir Palestinian identity and existence, and they're not going away. So I think that that's where\nthe function is important of this, whereas those that are complicit in the oppression need to be liberated from their own oppression, you know, and liberated from what\nthey're participating in. Most Americans that I talk to,\nthat have absolutely no idea about what's going on, when they come to hear just a few stories of the plight of the Palestinian people,\nand the types of brutality that we have encountered,\nwake up to this and say, \"Oh my God, this is what\nmy tax dollars go to? This is what I'm a part of,\" right? So we have to liberate\npeople, across the board, from being oppressors\nor from being oppressed. - What do you think about\nthe seeming fact the majority of Palestinians support\nthe October 7th attacks? - You have to see the world,\ntheir world through their eyes. You can't try to see their\nworld through your eyes. If you live under occupation, you're routinely harassed\nat Israeli checkpoints, the occupation is expanding\ninto your territory, you're meeting families,\nyou know, regularly that have been thrown out of their homes and that are looking for a new place in the shrinking territory, you deal with routine airstrikes, you have no way to get out,\nyou have no way to grow, you don't even have a passport,\nyour education is subpar, your standards of living\nare lower than the rest of the world, and all you\nhear from the other side, which dominates the discourse\nand dominates every element of your existence, are\npromises of erasure, of complete erasure. 13,000 people I mentioned, 2023, 13,000 new settlement\nunits being advanced. If that happened anywhere, right, just think about what that means, right? When you clear out a village or two, and it's not that big\nof a territory, right? When you know that that's happening, and when you have been subjected to that, anyone that claims to be\nsupporting you or uplifting you from that state of misery\nis going to have sympathy. Whether you agree with their\nmission or their methods or not, it's human. It is human that if anyone says that they are going to\nget you out of this misery and inflict pain on those who\nhave given you a life of pain and promised you a future of pain, you're going to have\nsympathy to that group, whether you agree with them or not. I think that the question\nalso has to be asked, what about the Israeli public? Israel holds all of the\npower in that region, holds all of the power\nover that territory, is able to dominate the\nexpansion of its own territory and diminish any Palestinian territory, is able to place restrictions whenever it wants on Palestinian movement, trying to get to their\nholy sites or otherwise, whether it's Masjid Al-Aqsa\nor the Holy Sepulcher or the Church of Nativity, right? The majority of these Israeli\npublic, before October 7th, unfortunately, according to all polls, favors a non-democratic regime, the end of a two-state solution, does not care about the\nplight of Palestinian people, the majority of the Israeli public. Why is that, and what does that mean for Palestinians, right? Especially now, after this\ngenocide, the vast majority of the Israeli public does\nnot favor a ceasefire, right? What are we supposed to do when we see mainstream\nmedia coming out of Israel, pop culture, TikTok videos that only speak to a greater desire to eliminate the\nPalestinian people, right? So anyone that says that they are going to\nsupport your plight, whether you agree with their\nmission or their methods, is going to resonate with\nthat child that has grown up in those desperate circumstances. You know, Bassem Yousef had an\ninterview with Piers Morgan, and he was talking about this. I mean, just, he literally\ngave it a human story. If you're a child that's\ngrown up, you've lost limbs, your parents are dead,\nyour friends are dead, you have been made a refugee\ntwo or three times already, you have no future in sight,\nand then someone comes to you and says, \"I'm going to help you, and I'm gonna fight back on your behalf,\" of course, it's gonna resonate. It's human, right? And so, I think that it's important for us to see the world through their eyes, rather than try to see the\nworld through our eyes. - So as Malcolm X did, you're calling for highlighting the asymmetry in violence and asymmetry in moral reasoning. - Absolutely. It's important. You're not going to be\nable to solve this problem unless you're able to do that. And so when Malcolm said that, \"If you stick a knife\nnine inches into my back and pull it out six inches,\nthat's not progress.\" Progress is healing the wounds, and you're not even willing to acknowledge that the knife is there yet. Those that don't acknowledge\nwhat is determined now by any international\nhuman rights organization, even Israeli human rights\norganization, B'Tselem and others, to be apartheid, a state of apartheid and a state of occupation,\nand now an unfolding genocide, you know, are not partners for peace. - It just hurts me to think\nhow long it takes to heal. Even if the healing begins\nnow with a knife metaphor, it's just going to be generations because people don't forget. When your father and mother were murdered, or somebody that you know\nin your family was killed, they don't forget. - Look, I think the point\nis, is that we have to come to terms with the fact that the trauma of the past does not justify\nthe murder of the present, and the fear of the future\ndoes not justify the murder of the present. The urgency of the world right now should be entirely focused on ending this atrocity\nthat, unfortunately, the world has become so complacent with. Again, prior to October\n7th, this status quo was not acceptable, and\nthere was no means in sight in the global arena to rein this in, to make Israel more\naccountable, to stop this. I do believe in the power of healing, I do believe in the power of growth, I do believe that we have\nseen ugly episodes of history before that have been rectified. I also believe in the heart of my people. I believe that the\nPalestinian people are people of resistance, they're\npeople of resilience, they're people of courage, and\nthey're people of benevolence and magnanimity, and they\nare people who have been made to grow under the worst of circumstances. I don't see, in the hearts\nof young Palestinians that have been tormented,\nI don't see darkness. I see light, I see the\nability to still laugh and find joy despite\neverything that's happened. And so I think that the urgency right now just has to be towards\nensuring that they have a life, that they're not being killed anymore. - I was wondering if you can\ncomment on a idea and a notion that comes up often in\nconversations about this, of why can't other nations in the region take in Palestinian refugees? - So I think that we have\nto tackle what's implied by that at multiple levels,\nand I actually wanna walk back. You know, I was listening\nto Nikki Haley when she said in one of her interviews,\nyou know, \"And why is it that you think no one wants\nto take the Palestinians in?\" And she had like this deeply\ndisturbing laugh to it, or Ben Shapiro, when he\nsaid, \"Israelis like to build and Arabs like to bomb crap\nand live in their sewage,\" or, you know, why is it that no one wants to govern the Palestinians,\nsuggesting that Palestinians are ungovernable and not fit\nto bring into your countries, and that's why they're being turned away. You know who else faced that bigotry? Jews trying to escape the Holocaust. 1939, 300,000 Germans\napplied for refuge here in the United States. I think only about 10,000 were allowed in, and we also turned away ships of Jews that were seeking refuge\nhere in the United States. On what basis, that they were\na national security threat and could not be trusted,\nthey could not be taken in. That's the same bigotry\nthat's driving this. And I want you to think\nabout it, you know, from that perspective, how\ndeeply offensive that is when you have millions of\nPalestinians in diaspora. Where have Palestinians caused\ntrouble where they've gone? Everywhere Palestinians are, they have overcome significant\nhurdles to become scientists and doctors and to grow\nthemselves and to grow the places that they're in. Where have Palestinians\nthat have been displaced all over the world caused\nissues for people, right? So it's both racist and\nfactually incorrect. That's not the right question\nthat should be asked. The question that should be asked are why are these people\ndriven from their homes, not why won't other people around them open their homes to them? And so, I'll just share with you that, even on a personal level, you\nknow, it's really interesting because sometimes on\nTwitter or wherever it is, it'll be like, \"Go back home,\" right? Why don't you go back home? And I'm sitting there\nthinking to myself like, \"Sure, you know, my parents\nwere driven from their homes.\" Yeah, sure, I was born in this country as a consequence of bad policy. Now I embrace my complicated\nidentity in that regard, and I hope to be\nproductive as an American, but I am a Palestinian, and\nPalestinians in diaspora that have been fortunate enough\nto have the ability to build and to overcome circumstances\nshould not be an excuse for eliminating the Palestinians\nthat remain in their homes under that torment, so\nthis bigotry is not new. Unfortunately, its manifestation is ugly, and, you know, we have to push back on it whenever it shows itself, no matter who it's being spoken about. - How difficult has it been\nfor people in Gaza to flee? - I mean, they're blockaded\nfrom all directions. There is nowhere for people in Gaza to go. They cannot get out, and, you know, the reality is, is that\nthey don't wanna leave. They do not wanna leave. The Palestinian people\nwant to live in their land and their homes and to\ncontinue to produce, you know, an extension\nof the beautiful culture and legacy that was handed to them. They don't wanna leave, in\nfact, those that have fled for whatever reason, or\nhave been able to get out for medical treatment or\nbecause they have some sort of citizenship in other countries,\nall they're talking about is going back and rebuilding. You can't bomb Palestine\nout of our hearts. You cannot starve Palestine\nout of our hearts. I think that's a critical\nmistake that Israel is making, and it thinks that if\nit destroys Gaza enough, if it wipes out all the buildings, that people will never wanna come back. We don't want to go anywhere\nas a Palestinian people, you know, in a way that would\nremove us from our homes. - The Palestinian people are proud people. - Yeah, you've met a lot of 'em, right? When you sat with Mohammed El-Kurd, their people in East Jerusalem. What those people have been\nsubjected to, you know, the harassment, like,\nthink about the tenacity and the character that it takes to still try to walk back into your home after an intruder has been\nbrought in by the state that's sitting in your living room, that is pushing you\naround, and you're saying, \"I'm not leaving my home.\" This is literally what's been\nhappening in East Jerusalem, and we're not going anywhere. I think those of us that are in diaspora, Palestine is not leaving our hearts, and those of us that are still there are not leaving their land. And the world has to make the\noccupier more accountable, not tell the occupied how to cope. - Do you ever imagine that\nif your family did not flee and you were now living in, say, in Gaza, what you would be doing? - I think about what could\nhave been all the time. You know, I actually mentioned\nthis in the first DC protest, that I remember getting a\nnotification, a news notification, just prior to October, with\nmy name in it, you know, so I always get these\nnotifications, right? If my name's been mentioned in an article. And so, oh, your name's been\nmentioned in an article, and it was a 16-year-old Omar Suleiman who was murdered in the West Bank. He literally had my name. I held up his picture, and I realized that could have been me. So I think of why God\nchose me to not be there, and, hopefully, him choosing\nall of us that are not there to be for those that are still\nthere, to be their voices. I'm grateful, and I'm also in pain. I'm grateful for the opportunity to be able to speak on their\nbehalf, but I'm also guilty that they have to bear the\nbrunt of this evil hatred that, unfortunately, displaced our parents in the first place. - You mentioned that\nPalestinians invoke the plight of Indigenous people,\nlike Native Americans. What works and doesn't\nwork about this analogy? - So I think that there's\na powerful connection between the Palestinian\npeople and the Indigenous in this land and in other\nplaces that have been wronged. We are living here in the\nUnited States on stolen lands that is drenched in the\nblood of the Natives, and that was built upon with the blood, sweat, and labor of enslaved Africans that were brought from overseas. It's a great evil that we have\nto reckon with constantly. And so I think that's\nthe power of solidarity, and, you know, if you look in Canada and you look in places like Australia, there has been a refocus on the crimes against the Indigenous of those places. I think that what makes\nthe Palestinian plight deeply painful, and\nmaybe where the analogy even doesn't do justice, is\nthat from the river to the sea is less than 500 times\nwhat the United States is in terms of land. It's not that big of a piece of land, and so the original lie\nwas a land without a people for a people without a land, and the problem was that\nthere were people on that land that were forcibly removed. So I think that the sheer size, right, we're talking about a tiny piece of land, and a lot of people that\nwere removed forcefully from their land, and they\ncontinue to be brutalized under those miserable conditions. - Why is Palestine a\nspecial place, a holy land? - It's the land of prophets. It is a land that holds deep\nsignificance, obviously, to Jews, Christians, and Muslims. It's the land of Abraham,\npeace be upon him. It is the land that has\nsuch a rich history to it that connects multiple\npeoples in multiple ways. It's precious. I think that history, while\nit tells the story of tragedy and struggle over that piece of land, also tells a beautiful story of sanctity. - So you mentioned Abraham, prophets. Prophet Mohammed is deeply\nvenerated in Islam, obviously, but other prophets are as\nwell, Jesus being one of them. What are the similarities and differences in the teachings from these two prophets? - Well, Islam refers to this\nidea of submission to one God and attaining peace in the process, and refers to the way of life that prophets have all come\nwith, which is this idea of monotheism and serving that one God in the way that he\ncommands you to serve him. So to us, as it says in the Quran, that we do not distinguish\nbetween the prophets. All of the prophets came with\none message, one mission. There's a coherence in the creed, there's a beauty in the foundation of what would become the legislation of each of those prophets. And we see them all as\nsiblings in prophethood. And so we say, \"Abraham,\npeace be upon him.\" We say, \"Jesus, peace be upon him.\" We say, \"Moses, peace be upon him.\" We say, \"Mohammed, peace be upon him.\" We believe that Moses came to confirm what came from Abraham, Jesus came to confirm\nwhat came from Moses, Mohammed came to confirm\nwhat came from Jesus. They upheld the same message. God did not change over\ntime, nor did the centrality of his message of\nmonotheism change over time. And so to us, it's one beautiful house. There's a saying from\nthe Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, where\nhe describes the house of prophethood, each\nprophet being a brick, and him simply being the last\nbrick of a beautiful house. And so we love the prophets\nof God, and we believe that they each came with the legislation that was necessary for the\ntime, but with the same message. - So the message is\nfundamentally the same. Is there a difference in\nemphasis, for example, the emphasis on love with Jesus? - Yeah, you know, this is, it's\nlike when you talk about MLK and Malcolm to an extent, except there was actually\nsome difference, right, between MLK and Malcolm. - [Lex] Yes. - You know, I just think that\nthe difference is exaggerated between them, but I don't think that Moses didn't emphasize\nlove, but Jesus emphasized love, and then Mohamed didn't emphasize love, peace be upon them all. I think that they each\nemphasized the same attributes and names of God and ways of knowing God, but there were, of course,\nchanges within legislation, changes within the divine law, but the divine spirit remained the same, and so I don't see them as\nbeing counter to each other, nor do I see that any\nprophet betrayed the message that came before them. I think they're all part of\nthe same beautiful message that we have to be at\nharmony with our creator and that we turn towards\nhim for our guidance, and that when we do so, we establish a greater\nexistence here on Earth. And so I think that that's\nsomething that's consistent throughout the message\nof all the prophets. - You have been longtime friends with and had amazing conversations\nwith people of other faiths, Christian, Jewish. How has the events of October 7th and the days after affected\nthis, in the United States, your ability to have\ninterfaith conversations, connections, relationships, friendships? - Complicated, very complicated. And it's not just Muslims and Jews, it's also Christian Zionists. Christian Zionism is at\nthe root of the problem, in my opinion, especially\nwhen we talk about what drives America's unshakeable, unconditional commitment to Israel. It's devastating, I think, to Palestinian Christians in particular, when Israel can bomb some\nof the oldest churches of Christianity in Gaza and\nkill Palestinian Christians, and Palestinian Christians are barred from going to the Holy Sepulcher or to their places of worship\nin Bethlehem or Jerusalem, and Christians here in the United States turn their back on them. I think that it is\nparticularly outrageous, so it's complicated. Look, I expect more from people\nin the face of a genocide. We don't have to agree\non all the particulars, but we can agree that what is happening is morally outrageous, and so I think that I've had a few people\nthat have reached out and said, \"I wanna say something, but I can't,\" and I've had to respond,\n\"Well, that's not good enough.\" So I think that we have a problem, and instead of focusing on that problem, I'd like to focus on the more\nmorally consistent voices across faiths that have\nrisen to the moment, rather than those that have failed. - So you wish more rabbis would be able to have a conversation\nlike we're having today, and also not allow it to be seen as them turning their\nback on their religion. - Rabbis, pastors, again,\nit's not just, you know, Jewish leadership, it's\nalso Christian leadership. I think that it's important for those that have claim to be allies in the fight against Islamophobia to see that you cannot be opposed to Islamophobia while also extending\nanti-Palestinian bigotry. - Yeah, one of the things,\nsince we last spoke, I've gotten to meet a lot\nof Palestinian Christians, including in West Bank,\nand that was fascinating, and those are beautiful people. - I think people should watch Reverend Munther Isaac's\nsermon on Christmas, \"Jesus in the Rubble.\" It was deeply profound. You know, I had a chance\nto speak to Mitri Raheb from the Lutheran church there as well. Now they're devastated. You know, it was eyeopening\nto many people here when Justin Amash, who was a\nRepublican congressman, right, Palestinian Christian\nRepublican congressman, posted about his own family dying in one of the church bombings. So it's strange, strange times,\nand I think that it shows that the philosophy of hate\nthat drives this terrible policy is secular at its root and not religious. - One of the criticisms of\nIslam points to specific verses of the Quran, and the criticism being that it is not a religion of peace. Can you speak to that? - So, objectively speaking,\nif you were to take the verses of the Quran about\nviolence and compare them, just from a purely\npercentage-based comparison, to the New Testament\nand the Old Testament, you would find less verses\nabout war in the Quran than the Old Testament\nor the New Testament, and there are plenty of\nstudies to speak to that. Deeper than that, contextualizing\nthe birth of Islam, the revelation of the Quran,\nwhich was over 23 years, in response to deep persecution of the Prophet Mohammed,\npeace be upon him, makes it very clear that\nnone of those verses are what they've been made out to be. If Muslims believed that\nthey had to kill people wherever they are,\nmankind would not exist. There are two billion of us, right? If we believe that we\nwere called by the Quran to hurt people and to kill people simply for being non-believers, right, it would not make for a sustainable world. So Islam is not violent,\nand I think that the history of Muslims also bears witness to that. The history of Islam is a\nhistory of contribution, is a history of building,\nis a history of medicine and science and math, and, of course, Muslims have sometimes fallen\nshort of Islamic standards in the past and in the present, but if you look at the\noverall history of Islam and the history of the Muslim community, that's not the case. And when you look at the present,\nyou know, Muslim community around the world, Muslims do not account for a greater proportion of violence than other faith communities. And again, the word\nterrorist is a functionless and meaningless word because,\nto me, it's no less violent if it's commanded by a head\nof state or by a government than by a non-state actor. So Muslims do not account\nfor a greater portion of violence now, nor have they accounted for a greater portion\nof violence in the past. - Why do you think these\nnarratives have taken hold in present discourse, at\nleast in the United States? - Because they allow for greater violence against the Muslim community\ndomestically and abroad. The United States has launched wars against primarily Muslim countries, right? And has a particularly\nviolent foreign policy towards the Muslim world. And the Muslim community\nhere in the United States has dealt with, unfortunately, multiple aggressive iterations of programs of suppression and surveillance under Republican and\nDemocratic administrations. And so there's a convenience\nto that Islamophobia, there's a convenience to that framing of the Muslim community\nthat also distracts from other forms of violence\nthat are deeply pervasive and present, including the\nones that are committed by the government itself. - If it's okay, you've\nmentioned Al-Aqsa mosque a couple of times. I would love it if you can describe why it is such an important\nplace, a holy place, for Muslims in general, but\nalso for this particular crisis that we have been speaking about today. - So Muslims honor the history of all of the prophets, right? So all of the prophets that\nhave walked in that place, all of the prophets that\nhave worshiped in that place, all of that makes it sacred, right? So it's not separated from\nMuslims from, you know, post-Mohammed, peace be upon\nhim, versus prior to Mohammed, peace be upon him, in terms\nof the sanctity of that place. So we honor it, and Masjid\nAl-Aqsa, in particular, is the place where the Prophet\nMohammed, peace be upon him, leads the other prophets\nin prayer in the night of what's known as Al-Isra' wal-Mi'raj, the night journey of the\nprophet, peace be upon him, and then he ascends to\nthe heavens and back, and it's also the first qibla, which is the first place of\ndirection of prayer for us. So before Muslims faced Mecca in prayer, for the first half of Islam, they actually faced towards\nJerusalem in their prayer. It was our direction of prayer, and it remained a fundamental\npart of our faith, a fundamental holy sanctuary. There are three sanctuaries in Islam, Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem, and Masjid Al-Aqsa is precious to us. And so you can imagine then\nthe pain of watching, you know, innocent Palestinian\nworshipers being stomped on by Israeli soldiers or skunk\nwater being sprayed on people as they're trying to\nwalk in, or, you know, teargassing taking place\nin the nights of Ramadan in that place, the restrictions on people that live right next to it,\nand that cannot pray in it due to the certain\nclassification of Palestinian that they've been given,\nor the age, right, because, generally\nspeaking, if you're younger, you're not allowed to\ngo to Masjid Al-Aqsa, even if you live within\nthe occupied territory, so it's tough to watch such a sacred place with such an ugly occupation,\nbut I'll also say this, that the sanctity of a human being, the sanctity of just one person, is greater than the sanctity\nof any place of worship to us. So the sanctity of one individual in Gaza, or one individual in\nJerusalem is greater to us than the sanctity of a place of worship, but it is all certainly interconnected. - That's a really powerful idea. The value of a human being is greater than even the Al-Aqsa mosque. That's a foundational idea for Islam? - The Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, says to the Kaaba itself that the value of a believer's dignity and\nhonor is greater than the value of the structure itself,\nand so, when I see a person in Gaza aggressed upon, when\nI see one Wael Al-Dahdouh, when I see one child, that's greater to me than even Al-Aqsa, but\nAl-Aqsa is at the heart of who we are as well, and\nit's certainly at the heart of the Palestinian cause. It's a place of prophets, and it's a place that should be treated prophetically. - You mentioned to me\nthat since October 7th, a lot of young people\nin the United States, and in general, have been\nshowing interest in Islam. First of all, can you explain\nwhat you've been seeing and experiencing in terms of that trend? - Yeah, we have Quran TikTok trends, where you had a few people\nthat went on camera and said, \"You know, I'm reading the\nQuran for the first time.\" And I think that that's\nthe beauty of the faith of the people of Gaza, the\nbeauty of their resilience. You know, when you're\nlooking at these people living what's hell on earth but they're seeking paradise outside, and they're able to still\nbe inspired towards words of faith and determination and certainty, you're like, what is their secret, right? What are they reading? What are they on that allows them to still face this brutality\nwith such grace, right? I mean, they're not shouting profanities, they're not shouting, you\nknow, words of emptiness or despair, but rather, they\nare pouring out their hearts that are full of faith\nfor the world to see, and I think that a lot\nof people have seen that and said, \"What is that?\" And so, you know, we've\nhad multiple people come to the mosque. I've never seen more people\nbecome Muslim in my life, but not just that, but gain\nan appreciation for Islam, like what type of an engineering is there, you know, that allows for people\nto have that type of faith? So people are opening the\nQuran for the first time. People are asking questions\nabout Islam in a way that shows that they're inspired, even\nthough they're heartbroken by what they're seeing. - What's a good way to\nget introduced to Islam, the faith, the spiritual experience of it? - Well, I think, look,\nyou go to, you know, our websites, you go to\nwhyislam.org, you go to, you come to Yaqeen's\nwebsite, yaqeeninstitute.org, you go to multiple Islamic websites to get those questions answered, but there's nothing\nlike going to a mosque. There's nothing like\nactually going to a mosque and meeting Muslims and asking questions. And I tell people like,\n\"You have to step out of your comfort zone and go there and let your world be\ncomplicated a bit.\" (chuckles) Experience it, listen to the sermon, meet people from different\nbackgrounds, and ask questions. Muslims love to be asked, by the way, about their faith because they're so sick of hearing other people talk about it. So Muslims love to be\nasked about their faith. Palestinians love to be\nasked about Palestine because they're so sick of\nother people talking about it. So ask questions, and you\nwill have them answered, but there's nothing like\na physical connection, there's nothing like a human connection, so definitely try to reach out to your local Islamic\norganizations and meet people. - How difficult is it to convert to Islam? - Takes 20 seconds, man. (laughs) - Okay, (laughs) simple enough. - You testify to the one, there's no pool, there's no baptism. Like I often joke with people, I'm like, \"All right, we got the pool in the back. We're gonna do the baptism now.\" You know, it's literally\ntestifying to the oneness of God and testifying that Mohammed\nis his final messenger. And so that's called the\nShahada, and when you testify to the oneness of God and\nto the Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him,\nbeing his final prophet, you are accepting what's known\nas the Six Articles of Faith. Six Articles of Faith\nare belief in one God, belief in the angels,\nbelief in the messengers, so you can't be a Muslim without\nbelieving in Jesus or Moses or Abraham or Mohammed,\nto believe in the messages that God has spoken to humanity\nthrough divine revelation, the Quran being the last revelation, to believe in the day of judgment, and to believe in divine\ndecree and predestination. So those are Six Articles of Faith. So when you testify to the oneness of God and to the Prophet\nMohammed, peace upon him, being the final messenger,\nthat's called the Shahada. You embrace the package of\nthose articles of faith, that's the implication. Then you learn the prayers,\nlearn to fast in Ramadan. You give what's known as\nzakah, the mandatory charity, 2.5% of your retained earnings, and Hajj, which is the pilgrimage\nto Mecca, if you can. So that's the growth part, the journey. You know, once a person takes\nthe testimony, they then grow. It's really interesting because\nwe always have those people that convert to Islam like\na week before Ramadan, or even a day before\nRamadan, so you're Muslim and you gotta fast the next day, you know? And that's always a challenging\nexperience for people, but a fulfilling\nexperience for many people when they embrace Islam at that point. And again, I mean, it's simple, and I think that the beauty of Islam to many people is in its simplicity. One god, one humanity,\none body of prophets, and one community. - Because for you, as a\nPalestinian American, this year, the Ramadan perhaps would\nbe especially difficult, spiritually, what are you anticipating? What do you think is the\ndifference this year? - (sighs) I hope and pray\nthat we have a ceasefire before Ramadan. I hope that, at that point,\nwe're rebuilding Gaza, talking about rebuilding\nGaza and helping people that have been damaged in\nso many different ways. I hope that Ramadan is turning a corner. Every Ramadan, the aggression against the Palestinian\npeople seems to grow. So we're usually dealing\nwith, you know, last 10 nights of Ramadan, and then the\nincursions on Masjid Al-Aqsa really sour it for the\nentire Muslim world, right? 'Cause you're watching\nworshipers being assaulted in one of the holiest places in the world, and at the same time, you're trying to find\nyour deep connection, your own deep, holy\nconnection, right, in Ramadan. This time, we're going in,\nand if this is still ongoing, we're dealing with a continued genocide, so I think that the mood has\nbeen somber in the community, the mood has been different from anything I've ever seen before, so I anticipate this\nRamadan would be different from anything we've ever seen before. I think the focus will\ncontinue to be on Gaza and on either stopping\nthe aggression on Gaza or beginning the rebuilding of Gaza. - So a general heaviness\npermeates just your prayers and your thoughts throughout this? - Yeah, I mean, look,\nevery sermon I've given since October 7th has had to\nhave some inclusion of this because it's what's on\neveryone's hearts and minds. We also have people in our communities that have lost 20, 30, 40\npeople, right, in our midst. It's not the same. You know, if we start to have\nrefugees or people that escape for medical treatment or\nthat are able to get out through Egypt and join their families, you know, it's becoming more real, right? It's becoming more personal for people. So I think that Ramadan will surround, both in terms of messaging\nas well as community, the pain of the moment with a\nprayer for hope and healing. - Not to put you on the\nspot, but in your sermons, in your private life, what\nis the passage in the Quran that is one you find\nyourself returning to often? - You know, the part of the Quran, I get asked this question, that resonates with me most usually has\nto do with what is heaviest for me at the moment. There is a verse in the chapter of Mary, a part of the verse,\n(speaks foreign language) your Lord does not forget,\nyour Lord does not forget. And so, you know, as you see\nwhat's transpiring right now, our hope is not in creation,\nour hope is in our creator, and our hope is not in this life, our hope is in the afterlife. And so that verse deeply\nresonates because I think that, you know, many of us often wonder how are they gonna rebuild? How are they gonna get past this? And we know that God has a\nway of restoring everything. God will restore everything,\nif not in this life, then in the next. - So there's an eternal flame\nof hope that burns there. - Yeah, and the people of Gaza have it. The people of Gaza have it. You know, you can be more easily deluded by this material world\nif you're hostage to it, but the people of Gaza\nhave never been deluded by the material world because\nthey never really had it. They've always been\nattached to a greater idea, to a greater place, and so it is part of the secret ingredient\nthat they have, right? That they believe in\nsomething greater than this. And so you can't survive hell on earth unless you believe in\nparadise outside of it. - When you look far into the future, 20, 30, 40 years from now, we're doing another podcast\nin 80s and 90 years old, what do you hope to\nsee in the Middle East? What do you hope to see\nchange in the Middle East and the United States as a people, as a set of policies, cultures, nations? - I think that the nation\nstate model and nationalism are becoming so unsustainable\njust with the growth of refugee populations,\ndesperate refugee populations, the rise of, unfortunately,\nfanaticism and fascism in different parts of the world. Climate, you know, and all\nthat that presents to us in terms of displacement. We're going to have to\nfigure out how to function as a world rather than\nas nations and states. We're going to have to figure out how to not see everyone outside\nof our borders as threats, and people that are different from us, within our borders, as threats. We're gonna have to start\nseeing people as people. And so my hope would be that we would have made\npeople uncomfortable enough to transcend some of the\nbarriers in their hearts and some of the barriers\nthat we have in the world that don't allow us to see\nother people as people, and then that drives, you\nknow, horrific policies towards people that\nare so distant from us. - You have been fearless in\nwalking through the fire. What gives you strength,\npsychologically, to keep going, to speak out, but just\nalso maintain an optimism and a hope for the future? - I don't believe that\nanyone gives me success or causes me failure without\nthe permission of God. I don't seek fuel from anyone else. I don't seek hope from anyone else. I believe in a creator\nthat has a greater plan, and I want to be a\ngreater part of that plan. And I'm inspired by the\nresilience of the people of Gaza. I'm inspired by the\nresilience of my parents and our grandparents and\nPalestinians around the world that have refused to\nsuccumb to their erasure, that have refused to give up. And so we have both the\nenergy that we need, and we have the examples that we need. The energy is from above. The examples are all around us. - Well, Omar, imam, this is a huge honor to once again speak with you, and I just wanna say thank\nyou, not just for this, but for many private\nnotes you have sent me, of kindness and support and love, through some of the low points,\nfor, as silly as they are for me personally, so\nit's just great to be able to call you a friend and\nto be able to have you in my corner, it's, I'm forever\ngrateful to you for that. - I appreciate it, thank you so much, man. - And thank you for talking today. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Omar Suleiman. To support this podcast,\nplease check out our sponsors in the description, and now,\nlet me leave you some words from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \"We shall overcome because\nthe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\" Thank you for listening, and\nhope to see you next time."
