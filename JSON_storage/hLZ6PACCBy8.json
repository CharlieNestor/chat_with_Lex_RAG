      "text": "- How would a kangaroo attack a human?` - Knock 'em down and then they choke him. - Who, the kangaroos do? - They choke each other. Yeah. - They don't choke each other. - You don't believe me? You gotta watch the video. They choke each other out. (chuckling) - I've seen this, yeah. - I mean, probably the most annoying one\nwas obviously the one where I had Gordon in Armbar was like, tap bro. And he wouldn't tap.\n- Yeah. - So, I let him out. (laughter) - I didn't get surgery. I didn't do essentially any rehab. I just have no ACL in my left leg. - So, what's it like having no-- - The surgeon goes,\n\"You've got two options. Surgery, rehab only.\" Nicky goes, \"I'll do nothing.\" Yeah, yeah. I mean, what could possibly go wrong if you are the world's\nbest grappler hates you, and you are gently provoking him behind the scenes every day? - Well, I mean,\n- In Texas. - And you've stolen his\nbrother, held him for ransom. - It is like a story of a shitty Western. - The last part of a\ndifficult wake up for me, is I try to find a sad\nmovie and at least cry about a pound out.\n(soft chuckling) That really gets me over the line. - What are the rules in the streets? - Do you think, if you're on steroids, you would've finished the choke? - I mean, for sure. - Who knew that the cure, to the Dagestani Wrestling, were the Aussies? - The following is a\nconversation with Craig Jones, Nicky Rod and Nicky Ryan. Who together with Ethan\nCranston, and others make up the B-Team, a legendary jiu-jitsu team\nhere in Austin, Texas. It was formed after the\nso-called Danaher Death Squad. The team headed by John Danaher split up into New Wave Jiu-Jitsu\nand B-Team Jiu-Jitsu. Both located here in Austin, Texas. There has been a lot of\ntrash talk back and forth, including accusations of\ngreasing and steroid use. And I, as a practitioner and\nfan of grappling, jiu-jitsu, and martial arts in general, am here for it. To see the best grapplers in history go at it both on the mat and on Instagram. I like the people on both teams, and train with both. And am really happy to see\nthe exciting rapid evolution of the sport that these athletes\nand coaches are catalyzing. This is, The Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Craig Jones, Nicky\nRod, and Nicky Ryan."

      "text": "Craig, can you introduce everyone? - Yep. So, we got Nicky Rod here. Brown belt, two-time ADCC silver medalist. Nicky Ryan, here. That's it. (laughter) - Okay. Who are you? - And I'm Craig Jones. Also, two-time ADCC silver medalist. - Silver medalist. So, the number one loser. - Number one loser. - And maybe a little bit more, your bio says, \"Widely known\nas the black belt slayer, hails from New Jersey, the\nland of pizza and biceps.\" - Ah, yes. That's pretty accurate. - Okay. You also do carry a gun on you a lot? - Yeah. I keep it loaded, you know?\n- Yeah. - Keep it on me.\n- Uh huh. - Do you have one today? - Uh, in the car. - That was a mistake. That was your first mistake. - Yeah, I think you're too close. (laughter) - It's very uncomfortable. - And you are Nicky\nRyan, what else is there? What else do we know? - Gordon Ryan's brother. - Gordon Ryan's brother. - Thanks for that one. (laughter) - All right. So, and you're all together\npart of the leadership of the the B-Team here in Austin. Let's just get out some\nintroductory questions. What in general, accomplishment\nof the things you mentioned are you most proud of? - I mean, I'm proud\njust to not have to work a full-time job just to get by on the bullshit I've done so far. - Yeah.\n- Honestly. - [Lex] Just making money\nof a thing you love. - Exactly, yeah. - When was the first time you made money on a thing you love? - Oh, probably a jiu-jitsu tournament. I think maybe in Abu Dhabi\nwhere I won a thousand dollars. Thought I was rich. - Yeah, yeah. What'd you spend a thousand dollars on? - Probably something bad? Probably drugs or something at the time. Maybe blew it at the after party. (light chuckling) - That's a good introduction to Craig. So, what about you? When's the first time you\nmade money on jiu-jitsu? Or, what's-- Actually, stepping back, like, what's the thing\nyou're most proud of? Is it a similar kind of thing? - I think I'm most proud of is, I mean, for sure two ADCC silver medals, which hurts cause you're so\nclose to getting that gold. But, you know, it takes time. I'm understanding that, you know, the sport of\njiu-jitsu takes quite a while to be at the tip top to\nbe the absolute best. So, and I'm just being\nconsistent in my training and my craft and, you know, I'll get that number one spot one day. - What failure or loss is\nthe most painful to you? - I don't know. I have probably a pretty\nshort term memory. So my losses, I just like,\nI'll just forget about 'em. Yeah, I mean, for sure my loss at this\npast ADCC in the finals, you know, that one stung a bit, cause I definitely\nthought I was gonna win. I mean, like, it takes a\nwhile to produce the skills or the reactions more\nso, that you need to have to be, you know, to be that\nnumber one pound for pound guy. And, you know, pre-ADCC, I was coming off of\ninjury so it took me a little bit to find the right\nmentality and physicality that I needed in order to, you know, get the wins that required gold. So yeah, it's just a process. - Interesting. You keep saying process, like\nit takes a while to build up. So, you're not like thinking of a loss, like ADCC as like a specific failure. You haven't gone long enough\nin a particular process to being a champ. - Well, I mean, for me, I'm closing in on five\nyears of specifically jiu-jitsu training. I'm at about four and a half right now. And yeah, it's just the, you constantly have these\nups and downs in training where like, as long as\nyou stay consistent, you'll have a gradual raise. But you know, it's still, you'll have these peaks and lows. And you know, just trying\nto get better every day. I'm definitely not where I will\nbe in a few years from now, but I'm striving to get there. - Are you actually a brown belt? Or was that a joke? - Brown belt, yeah. - You're a brown belt. Like how many stripes? - No stripes. - No stripes. Okay.\n- Stripeless. - Okay. Is that part of the process,\nthat you're working through? - Definitely part of the process. I mean, I think a black belt is\njust based upon how much knowledge you have. Obviously, like, you know, if you're talking competitive wise, like from when I started, I was able to beat most black belts. That's just kind of how I was gifted from my wrestling experience. And you know, the time\nwill come when it's right, but I'm not in a rush at all. I'm continuing. I just kind of take\nevery day for what it is, and try to improve upon that. - I mean, I wanna give him the black belt. Nicky Ryan says he's not ready. (Nicky Rod laughs) - Are you guys, like as No-Gi folks, do you take that seriously? Like, the black belt? Or like, how much does\nit come into play into-- - Yeah, I mean it's like\nNicky Rod said, you know, it's based off of knowledge, not just, you know, what you do out\non the competition mats. Cause you know, like he said, he had years of wrestling experience, and obviously he's very physically gifted. So, we grade based off of\nthe amount of knowledge that you have. - Like, how do you measure knowledge? - I think teaching is a\ngood measurement of it. Like, how well you're\nable to show the moves, and you know, really\nmake sure that you have an understanding of what you're doing. - Yeah. It's an interesting rank. It's like, it's something that takes\nmany years to accomplish, and for a lot of people\nit's truly meaningful. It's like it represents a\nparticular step in a journey. But for you guys, it's almost like different, because you've been so\nfocused on competition that I guess if you take it seriously, it is a big step for you too, like as martial artists,\nthat's bigger than just being like top of the world competitors, right? So, I thought it was a joke. You guys are actually taking it seriously. Like--\n- That he's a brown belt. - That he's a brown belt and he's, and you're taken seriously, the rank of black belt and like, it's part of your journey. - I think by the time I get a black belt, I'll be no more pound for a pound. I think it'd be pretty\nnice to accomplish that as a brown belt and then maybe\ntoss a black belt on top. - Maybe get promoted on the podium."

      "section": "Winning and losing",
      "text": "What do you guys, do you love winning or hate losing more? - I definitely don't hate losing. If it pays the bills, I don't mind. - [Lex] Oh really? - Yeah. But, honestly if I win I feel\nmore relief than anything rather than like excitement and stuff. I'm like, \"Oh, thank God that's over.\" You know?\n- What about you? - I hate losing for sure. But I understand that it's\nnecessary to get, you know, to get to where you want to be. And then winning is like, I mean, what I think winning is probably the closest you can think, you can get to like heroin or something. Cause I mean we're on a high-- Like if you do have extreme success in a tournament that\nyou've been, you know, adamant about training for,\nand competing in for a while and you end up winning it, I mean I feel like you're on that high for days at a time afterwards. - Heroin's gotta be better. - You think so? I'ma stick with no, but. - I'm not gonna suck dick to win. (laughter) - You sucked dick for heroin? (laughs) Okay. I guess that's a good point. Yeah. - But you know like, because you coming from a little bit of the wrestling culture. One of the things I really\nlove is at the end of the match when they lose they just, there's no, they just run off. - Yeah. - They're like almost pissed off. It's like some mixture\nof anger and frustration at themselves. - I think sometimes that people\nlike freak out on the mat. And I think that's just to show everybody, like, they're acting\nlike they cared a lot. And really maybe they didn't\nwork enough to you know, get to where they want to, where they expected to be. And they lost and then they\nhad this big boost of emotion like after their loss. But yeah, I mean, I think, you just cry in the mirror not to everybody else, you know? - Have you ever cried watching a movie? - I don't think I've ever cried, period. - Okay. Have you cried watching a movie? - Not yet. Not yet. - The notebook. - [Craig] I try to avoid those movies. Actually, - Lion King,\n- I lie. Actually,\n- Titanic. - The last part of a\ndifficult wake up for me is I try to find a sad\nmovie and at least cry about a pound out. That really gets me over the line. Low energy, cutting. - The tears. (chuckling) There's other following liquids\nI could talk to you about, but let's just continue on. - Low energy. - What about you, Nicky? Love of winning versus hate of losing? - I'm a very competitive person. So, I for sure hate losing\nmore than I like winning. I do think it's something\nthat's kind of held me back over the past few years cause, it makes it so that I'm not\nas active as I should be. Cause it's like I really hate\nthat feeling of, you know, after a match that you just lost. So, it kind of prevents me from competing. So, it's definitely something\nI need to work past. - So, like when you think\nabout a competition, the possibility of losing, which is always there in competition, is the thing that like weighs heavy on you in the months and weeks leading up to it? - Yeah, my whole life, you\nknow, my financial stability, everything depends on, you know, my ability to go out there and compete, and my ability to teach. So, you know, it's a huge\nhit to the brand if you lose. So, you know, leading up to matches. That's definitely something\nthat's in my mind. - So, you guys are like\nworld class athletes, but for me, more like\na hobbyist competitor. I compete a lot. The thing I was-- Cause I really wanted to win. The thing I was probably most\nafraid of was not just losing, but like embarrassing myself. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah. - Even actually winning by stalling. That was the thing I hated\nthe most about myself, in terms of crying in the mirror, is like being too afraid to take risks after I'm up\non two points or something. - I think you gotta, in competition, sometimes it's good to\ntake the emotion out of it. It's too easy sometimes\nto like think about, oh my girls in the crowd\nand my family's watching. Like, I wanna win cause they're there. But at the highest level,\nif you're emotional at all, that's affecting you. - Yeah. That's tough though. (lightly chuckles)\nThat's tough. Especially like leading up to\nwhen you're on the map maybe, but leading up to it. - I think it's okay to be emotional prior. Like, you know, if we know ADCC or it's coming\nup and we have a big match, like definitely I'll go out and practice, and I'll visualize, I'll put myself in that competition. That way when it's game time, it's like, I've been there\na thousand times already. - So, not the actual competition,\nbut even leading up to it, like stepping on the\nmat, like all the walk, walk towards it, all that. - All that stuff. Like, I'll do the same exact\nwarmup for weeks on end until my competition day comes. That way, you know, when I compete I'm just like, Oh, it's another Tuesday at practice. - What about you, Craig? Like, how do you prepare\nmentally for tournament like ADCC? - I push it completely outta my mind. Don't even think about it. Try to avoid any visualization, any rituals, warmups, anything like that. Block it out until the last second. Yeah. Try not to think about it. I just kinda train to\nhave fun, learn a bit. So, I try to approach\ncompetition the exact same way. I don't warm up in training, do very little warmup for competition. - Uh huh. And do you just step on the mat? - Step on the mats. My philosophy is there's\nno warmups on the street. (chuckling) - We're so vastly different. (laughter) - All right. So, you like legit don't warm up? - No, I probably should now I'm 31. But I would just like in the gym, take it easy the first round. You know, like if I look around the room and Nicky Ryan's down, might go, \"All right, we'll have an\neasier first round today, so.\" (light chuckling) - So even for like the\nmost high stakes matches, you try to push it out. - Yeah, I didn't even think about it. - What about like all the social, like Instagram posts you\nhave to do about that match? You just make a joke\nout of it and kind of-- - Yeah. I mean, it's all kind of pretty silly. You know? We're just wrestling each other, you know? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- We put the meaning into it. But to someone that\ndoesn't follow the sport, it looks stupid. - Well all of human\nexistence is pretty silly. Like what are we doing? None of us really know what's going on. We kind of have sex to reproduce. We get hungry, we eat. And then we're all chasing money and cars, and whatever the hell,\nin a capital society. Or we worship a dictator\nin a authoritarian regime. Yeah. And then we get off on, we'll let power abuse us and\nthen we just murder others because we get off on it. Yeah. And then eventually all of us will die because the sun will run out of energy. Cause colonizing other\nplanets is very difficult. So, none of it matters. It's a good, good philosophy. It's pretty good. - That's exactly what I was thinking. - How does the sun run out of energy? (laughter) You caught me there. - It burn out. It's like a, it's a nuclear fusion engine\nand eventually burns out. - Like, when you get tired at training. - Yeah. It's never happened. I try to get tired. I was like, dude, it's like dude's like I not working. (laughter) - All right, cool. So, you legit don't care about losing? It doesn't weigh heavy on you. - I try not to list-- Like if I win, I try to block\nout all the compliments, all the niceties and stuff. So, I try to do the same with losing. It's happened. Move on to the next one. You know, don't dwell on it too much. - And sometimes make a joke out of it. - Yeah, exactly. Winning or losing, with the right joke, we can make money off of the\nevent that's just transpired. That's what's most important. - Excellent. Thank you. I have a bunch of your merch. - Oh nice. This one's the Jordan Burrow's rip off. - All I see is silver. The way he pronounce burrows is very sexy. Okay. - I throw lines at people and\nI try to gauge their reaction. Like sometimes I'll say something\nto Nicky and I'll be like, all right, that's probably\ncrossing the line. You know what I mean? We'll tone it down to the public. - So, what-- Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's not just right. You have to think, is\nthis crossing the line? - Yeah, yeah. I get as close to it as possible. Yeah. I feel like he can't really-- - And then cross it. Just a little bit. - Just a little bit, yeah. - Okay. Speaking of which,"

      "section": "Danaher Death Squad (DDS)",
      "text": "you said that I'm\nSwitzerland in World War II since I'm friends with both\nyou and Gordon and John. - Yeah. Very rich country. - Are you a Hitler or a Stalin\nby the way, in this analogy? Would you like to be Hitler or Stalin? And should you make a\nT-shirt out of it or? - I mean, honestly a T-shirt, I don't know how well that sells. You know?\n- I think it would, you know, I think that--\n(chuckles) Let's brainstorm on this one offline. (laughter) I think since Hitler lost. So, you got second place in World War II. - That's true. That's true. - I think that makes you Hitler. Anyway, to the degree that you can, can you tell the story of how\nthe time you've had with the Danaher Death Squad and why you split up? - I competed against Gordon for ADCC and EBI in 2017. And I remember I competed\nagainst him at a ADCC and then we had the EBI event, and then I had a Kasai. I used to compete all\nthe time, every week. I wouldn't even do the\npreparation or anything. I'd just be like trying to do seminars, make money and then jump in and compete. I remember I showed up to\nKasai after I faced him twice. And there were like four locker rooms, and they put me with all the DDS guys. It was just me and all of DDS. And I think we had competed\nthe weekend before. So, I thought it was\ngonna be super awkward, but it was actually, it was actually pretty chill. And the Kasai was in New York, and they suggested to\ncome train that week. So I came trained, hung\nout with 'em a bit. Ultimately, the goal\nwas to move to America and join a bigger team\njust cause that flight to Australia is death. Australia is so far away from everywhere. It's kind of like, not realistic to base\nyourself in Australia when all the tournaments are in America. And then I went and trained with the guys and they just had a massive, massively deep talent pool in that room. Like show up to like\na meant to be 7:00 AM, actually 8:00 AM class, on Brazilian time. And there'd be like a\nhundred people in there, maybe, I don't know how many black belts, but a ton of elite guys. And I was coming from Australia\ntraining with Lachlan Giles. But really, that room was pretty shallow and like most people had\nserious jobs and stuff. So, it was like basically me\njust training with Lachlan, maybe a couple of other guys. And then to go to New\nYork and have access to a wide array of training partners, and guys that are training twice each day. I feel like that's what you really need. You need people that can\ntrain as much as you are. - You get humbled? - Humbled? - Do you get humbled\nin that room at first? - For sure. Cause my style at the time was basically a rip off version of what they were doing. - [Lex] Yeah. - Leg locks came in. I remember just watching\nEddie Cummings nonstop, and just seeing this guy\nrip people's legs off and I was like, \"You know what? That's probably a good move.\" You know, that looks like an easier path to victory than trying to beat these guys at what they're good at already. You know? My philosophy at the time was, if it's bothering old Brazilians, - [Lex] Yeah. - It's bothering them for a reason. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It's probably effective. And that's the path I took to sort of try to rip off their moves, and then obviously to go into that room, try to do 'em to them, it's\ngonna be a bit more difficult. - All right. So, that's how it started. How did you end up here? - How do we end up here? - We're in Austin, Texas. - I mean, I like to think of\nPuerto Rico as Apocalypse now. John Danaher as Colonel Kurtz. Things got very weird in the jungle, and the teams went into\ndifferent interactions. But honestly, I mean it's\nnot really my story to tell. I had some issues with\nsome of those people. At the time of the split, I\ngot along very well with John. I feel like me and him\nconnected very well. I don't know why that was. Maybe it was just cause of, he missed home. He missed the familiar accent. Australian-New Zealand accent. But, I mean, I basically followed Nicky. - [Lex] Yeah. - Left with Nicky. Sort of that core group\nof guys left with Nicky. And I mean, I just backed, there was personal problems, and I just backed Nicky, basically. - Got it. Just sticking on you for a bit. Is there a part of you that, you know, finds it heartbreaking that DDS split up? Does part of you miss working\nwith John and everybody? Can you steal me on the case for that? - I mean, I miss certain aspects of it, but I also do prefer the\nfreedom of being apart from it. It's obviously a very strict\nregime under John Danaher. You know, obviously there's parts of it. I miss the parts that the\npublic doesn't see of John, the behind the scenes banter. I feel like he's very\nconscious of the imagery he portrays to the world. But basically, closed doors, he's always making jokes, always finding, I guess, more in line with the Australian Kiwi sort of culture. But you don't really see\nthat in the public eye. So that perspective, I do miss\nthat relationship with John. In terms of setting aside\npersonal differences, Gordon was a good training partner. Definitely a good training\npartner to train with. But obviously, the negative things we can't really talk about\noutweighed all of those things. And we obviously had to make\na decision to leave, but yeah. - What is that happening in the jungle? - The things happen in the jungle. - Shall never be spoken of. - That I personally cannot speak of. Yeah, but obviously I do\nmiss certain aspects like, I mean, nothing's all bad,\nnothing's all good, you know? - Yeah. This goes back to your like, everything we're doing is silly. - Yeah, exactly. That's why I didn't get\npeople take it so serious. Martial arts so serious. It's just... It's just pretty stupid really. Especially in the Gi, it\nlooks just, it looks bad. And then obviously--\n- I mean, it's pretty silly with and without the Gi. It's just a bunch of apes rolling around. - What's silly about No-Gi\nand what's silly about the Gi and just mixed and match bottoms there, you know what I mean? - Wait, which one?\n- Sambo. Yeah.\n(laughs) - I see what you're doing. Brother. (laughter) You come to my house and defend my people. All right. (chuckling) We're gonna go to every\ndark place, apparently. Nick, how did you get with DDS? Like what was that journey like? Is there, try to see if there's things\nthat you remember fondly, that you've gotten from the experience. - All right, so the way I\nstarted training with DDS, initially I was training for like, well initially I was a bouncer, right? I dropped outta college to pursue this fitness modeling career. I ended up signing with a\nWilhelmina models up in New York, and I was like trying\nto get in better shape. And while I was bouncing kind\nof the talk of like, you know, whose tougher came up\nbetween the wrestlers and a few of the bouncers\nthat trained jiu-jitsu. And you know, they convinced\nme to go to a practice. And I went to my first\npractice over there, and for the most part, I just controlled everybody,\ngot on top of 'em, was able to avoid like, kind of like, you know, shitty submissions. Cause I had an awareness of the sport, and you know, I'm a fan\nof fighting and whatnot. So, you know, I kind of\nunderstood it pretty well. And then soon after\nthat I joined a school, and my second week of\njiu-jitsu I started competing. Had pretty good success. You know, I was like\nsubbing a few black belts, and beating everybody like, you know, pretty decisively with points and stuff. And about three months\ninto training locally, I got connected with Gordon\nRyan and John Danaher up in New York. And I started, I committed to, you know, make the drive up there\nas many days as I could. At the time I lived in South Jersey, and it was about two and a\nhalf hour, three hour drive without traffic to New York. - Where in South Jersey? - Gloucester County. Clayton, New Jersey specifically,\nbut Gloucester County. Yeah. So, it was about 130 miles. And without traffic, it was about two and a half hours or so. But on the way back, man, we,\nit'd be three plus sometimes, you know, you're catching that rush hour. - What year was this? Do you remember? - This was in 2018. - I forget how young you are. I was there before, before all that. All right, cool. Anyway, you're doing the\nlong drive and then what? - Yeah, doing the long drive and then, you know, once I won ADCC trials, I was able to make a couple bucks. And then, you know, I got\nmy silver medal at ADCC, and I was able to afford to\nlive up there in New York, in north Jersey area. So I lived up there, trained there full-time\nevery day and you know, just kind of stuck with\nthe team throughout the turbulent times and\nfound ourself in Austin. - In the jungle. - In the jungle, yeah. - One of the things we shall not speak of. What, are there things that you remember that you've learned from John Danaher from your time you spent with him? - Yeah, I mean I definitely\nlearned a ton from John and the team as a whole. Like, you know, you have to be the guy that asks questions in that type type of environment, right? Cause there's not, it's not, you're not gonna get singled\nout to be that specific like star or the the best guy in the\nroom when you have all these other, you know, stud athletes. So, I really had to\nseek out and figure out the kind of questions\nthat I needed to ask. And once I became a bit\nmore verbal with my training and you know, I'm showing, I'm expressing all my curiosities\nabout grappling to these guys definitely helped boost my technique and my career as a whole. - Yeah. Did you understand what kind of stuff, like technically you want to get good at, what fits your body? What, like, what would be good for you? What are your weaknesses and all that? - So initially, and when\nI started grappling, I had an innate ability to\njust get to opponents back. So I was like, all right, I'm\ngood at getting to the back. Let me perfect controlling\nthe back and then submitting opponent via rear naked choke. And then besides that, I really\nfocus on leg lock defense, and then eventually came\nthe Rody lock pass where, you know, I'm really good at body lock passing my opponents now. And yeah, just takes a quite a long time, cause you have to find\ndifferent sequences, and then there's always these an abundance of opportunities\nthat your opponent gets from these specific sequences. So, takes a while. (Lex breathes deeply) - Is there part of you\nthat finds the fact that DDS split up heartbreaking? - I definitely, you know, having one person to go to that runs practice every day, that's, you know, consistent. It was definitely a gift. But now, I'm also gifted with\nmany, many other partners. I have Nicky Ryan, you know, Craig Jonesy. (laughter) - You just paused. Craig Jones. - Yeah, yeah. We have Ethan Crelinsten, Damien Anderson. So, a full team of knowledgeable athletes that I can continue to go\nto with multiple questions. But yeah, definitely, it took\nme some time to adjust to training or to learning from, you know, specifically my team\nand not just one person. - We should mention, for\npeople just listening, cause you can't visually see that Nicky Ryan is currently terrified. (light chuckling) And Craig Jones is currently enjoying the fact that Nick Ryan's there. But anyway, can you talk about your-- Nicky, can you talk\nabout your time with DDS? - I started training when\nI was like around 13. You know, my brother Gordon\nhad started prior to me. And, I really just went into training just as like a means to\nexercise and lose weight at the beginning, cause I\nwas pretty fat as a kid. So, I went to the first class, loved it. And then just started training every day at Gary's Gym Brunswick. And then, during the summer\nwhen I'd get off from school, they would take me up to New\nYork to train under John. And, you know, I just absolutely loved it. I knew what I wanted to do\nwith my life at a young age. So, I ended up dropping\noutta school actually, after my freshman year in high school. So yeah, 15 I ended up dropping out and just pursuing jiu-jitsu full-time. You know, training every\nday up in the blue basement. - Like what aspects of jiu-jitsu made you know that this is the thing for you? - It was just something I\njust enjoyed being, you know, like on the mats every day. I love that there's, you know, a problem solving aspect to it. So it's, you know, it's\nmentally challenging, it's physically challenging,\nhelps me get in shape. So, I just, yeah, right off the bat, I knew I loved it. - Okay, so then we'll go to the jungle. What happened in the jungle? (chuckles)\n- Yeah. - And in general, like... (chuckling) I like this, I like this\nlike shroud of mystery that shall never be penetrated. That should never be like-- - We've got a book deal. It's coming. - Book deal?\n- Yeah. - All right. - Obviously he left high\nschool, he's not writing it. - Okay. I'll do the Russian translation. (laughter) Okay. So, what are, what are things that you\nenjoy that you remember from working with John Danaher? - Yeah, I mean, you know,\nobviously he's considered one of the best coaches in the world. You know, very charismatic guy\nwhen you see him in person. You know, I pretty much was, you know, kind of raised in the DDS. You know, that's where I spent the majority of my time every day. So, I obviously had very\ndeep connections, you know, with John, my brother, Gary, you know, even Eddie\nCummings and stuff back then. So obviously, I miss interacting\nwith those guys every day. And you know, it's like they said, it's good to have somebody to kinda crack the whip at you every day. And John was very good at that. - When you're like younger\nin your teenage years, you can kind of, you like\nhave to get humbled, right? There's like a process to that. - Yeah, for sure. And... - That's a pretty good room\nto get humbled in, I guess. - Yeah, exactly. I mean, I was, I started training with them just when like everybody\nstarted to break out. Gary was like the\nbiggest name at the time, just cause he had won ADCC trials already, and he had a crazy match with Kron, at Kron Gracie at ADCC. But Eddie was just starting to break out. Gordon just started winning EBI. So, I started training\nunder John, you know, right when everything was exploding. - What are the good things about life, about jiu-jitsu you\nlearned from your brother? - Both me and my brother never\nreally wanted to, you know, work a full-time job doing\nsomething that we hate. And he was always, you know,\na very confident person. So he just went, you know, fully started pursuing jiu-jitsu. So, I'm very happy that, you know, he did that and I ended up\nfollowing in his footsteps because you can ask these guys, I'm a lazy sack of shit\noutside of the mat. So, that's definitely one thing\nthat I'm very grateful for. - That he paved the way, like, you can make money\ndoing stuff you love. - Yeah, exactly. And he was a big reason, you know, why my parents eventually\nlet me drop outta school. Because, you know, when\nthey were coming up, there was no money in the sport. It was very hard to make a full living. Like, if you wanted to\nactually make a living, you'd eventually have to transfer to MMA. And I feel like Gordon and\nGary and those guys were, you know, some of the first people to make a very good living\noff of just jiu-jitsu. - Does part of you find it heartbreaking that you've split up from DDS, but also from your brother in terms of spending time in the mat every day? - Yeah, for sure, you\nknow, I mean, growing up, you know, obviously he's my big brother. I looked up to him a lot. So I definitely, like I said, I miss interacting with those guys. I was pretty much raised, you\nknow, in that blue basement, you know, that John was like, you know, a father figure to me. So I definitely, you know, miss seeing those guys every day. - Do you have animosity towards Gordon? And does he have animosity toward you? And what is the source of that? And do you think you'll ever\nbe able to forgive each other? - Definitely initially,\nduring the initial split, we definitely hated each\nother at the beginning. But it's definitely started to calm down. Actually, just prior to, you know, all this social media drama\nthat's going on currently. (laughter) He had reached out to me and\nthat was literally like the first time that we have actually talked since the split happened. So, we didn't talk to each other for, what is it now like, almost two years? And that was the first\ntime that, you know, we interacted again. And overall, you know, he wasn't, you know, aggressive towards me. I wasn't aggressive towards him. We were cracking some jokes. So, hopefully the animosity is going down. - Well, there's this godfather\nquote that I wrote down, I recently re-watched it. From the Don, from Don\nCorleone, Vito Corleone. \"The strength of a family, like the strength of an army lies in its loyalty to each other.\" Is there some aspect\nof family that you miss of the blood that kind of connects you, that you can count on? - Yeah, my parents, you know,\nthey both raised us that, you know, like family is everything. You never, you know, betray your family or anything like that. So I definitely, you know,\nmiss him from time to time. - Okay. Imagine you're like 40 years from now, sitting on a porch with a\nshotgun drinking whiskey, looking over like all the\nland you've conquered. Looking back to this moment, is the reason you split\nup a bullshit reason? Or is it a good reason? From the perspective of the\nking who has now conquered the lands, have proven himself,\nhave done everything. - I think it was definitely\nlike a justifiable reason for the team splitting. Like it just, with the way things were going, it just was not gonna work with, you know, all of us in the same room together. It started, you know, affecting training. People didn't feel comfortable in things. So, I definitely think that it was a justifiable reason to split. - The things that happened in the jungle. (Nick Ryan chuckles)\n- Yeah. - To be told about in the book. Is it gonna be an audio book\nor is it just gonna be... And who's gonna voice it? - Might be a play. (laughter) - A musical?\n- Yeah, a musical. - On Broadway. How's your singing voice? - Mine's not so good, but\nNicky has a beautiful voice. - Does he? Of an angel? I bet. Okay."

      "text": "Speaking of the social media drama, I should mention that\nI've talked to recently to Gordon, a bunch. I've talked to him about\ntalking to you guys. And he's had nothing but\nreally nice things to say about you, Nicky Ryan. And he has had nothing but bad things... (giggles softly) - What was some of the things? - Um...\n(chuckles) (laughter) There's... Well, let's just go to\nthe social media first. (chuckling) Cause the social media\nstuff that he said publicly is just like, a warmup. It's like foreplay, I guess. So, Gordon sent you, Nicky Rod, flowers for Valentine's Day. A posting on Instagram, quote, \"I've been fucking him in\nevery round in competition since we met in 2018. The least I can do is buy him flowers.\" - We didn't get the flowers. - No, so... Yeah, that was the question. Did you get the flowers? You never got the flowers. - He sent it to the wrong address. - [Lex] He did?\n- Yeah. - Where do you think he sent it? - It was close, but it was wrong. - Did you appreciate the romantic gesture? - I did. I was looking forward to\nthe flowers and potentially chocolates in there, but you know, it was a bit of a letdown. - Can you describe your\nrecent match against Gordon? The EBI match. - Okay so, EBI match on UFC Fight Pass was a 20 minute match.\n(breathes heavily) And, immediately, you know match starts, I pulled guard and then I stand up, he pulls guard and we have this\nkind of like back and forth where he is trying to dig for underhooks, trying to get on top of me and\nhe can't really find success. And in the midst of me trying\nto work my body lock pass, Gordon's able to underhook\na leg and we end up in a leg entanglement. And then I'm able to transfer\nthat leg entanglement to a 50/50 position, still\nin the leg entanglement. From that 50/50 position, I'm\nable to separate his feet, and actually get a few\npops and he actually said I broke his foot in that exchange. - With a toe hold.\n- With a toe hold, yep. And you know, after that, we had a a bit more. I was just being working on top positions trying to get my body lock. Time runs out and we go to overtime. In overtime-- - Can you hold on a second, actually? - Yep. - What does it mean to break a leg? What does-- I was very confused about, - Okay, so-- - Is this like a expression\nor what do you mean? What do you mean broke? Which part breaks in a toe hold? - Okay, so in a toe hold there's a few different grades of it. Like you could get a\nfew pops and have some, you know, walking issues. And people consider that a break. And then you could break it\nfully and have your foot be like a limp noodle, you know? I think what are those? Achilles? Is it was the front of\nthe Achilles or something? - I mean, probably the ligaments. I mean it's funny like,\na lot of people say they broke something. But like to me, you break\nbones, you tear ligaments. So I would imagine, you\nprobably had a grade three tear. - Grade three. - How hard do you think is it to, I always wondered that with\nlike a straight foot lock, how hard is it to break the shin, or like the actual bones\nversus the tear stuff? - Depends how many steroids they're on. And obviously how much you're on. - You're one of the few guys\nthat have actually broken bones in competition. - Uh, yeah, have I? - [Nicky Rod] Oh yeah, many.\n- A couple, yeah. - Which bone did you break? - Spiral fracture of the fibula. - Hmm. - Very specific. - [Nicky Rod] A lot of power out there. - Was it a twisting? How did you break it? - Oh, it was a heel hook. Vinny always used to say\nheel hooks don't work, leg locks don't work. But unfortunately, age\ngets the best of all of us. I think he had some\nmileage on those ligaments. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And the bone, I guess. - So it's actually what? The bone... - Yeah, his ankle like disconnected from the tibia and the fibula. But the fibula definitely\nsnaps pretty bad there. - That's fascinating. The dynamics of that. Okay. Anyway, it went into overtime. What happened in overtime? - Okay, what happened in overtime? Let's see, trying to hang. Oh, okay. I go with defense first. Whistle blows, I'm able to escape in like 17 seconds. And then immediately\nafter, I go on his back, and he gets out in exactly 17 seconds. I'm like, shit, all right. I thought I had a good start. And then he gets on my\nback right after that, and he's able to ride me out for pretty much the entire round. After that, I got back on his back, he escapes in maybe like\na minute and some change. I think where I went\nwrong in the overtime is I should've been less adamant\nabout chasing the submission, and more aware of collecting time. If I kind of diverted my\nattention towards acquiring, you know, time on the\nclock, it would've been, you know, more of my favor. But yeah, at the end of my overtime round I'm able to lock up rear\nnaked choke over the face, but there just wasn't\nenough time to fully finish. You know, I got a few\nseconds of squeeze in there. I didn't have enough time to adjust and. Go ahead. - Do you think if you were on steroids you would've finished the choke? - I mean, for sure, for sure. - That's what I thought too. - If you're on gear, it you're, you're changing the biology\nof your body, right? You're adjusting your DNA. For sure, if I adjusted my DNA, I mean, - Yeah.\n- It's a finish. - So, you're implying\nyou're a natural athlete, is what you're saying? - Oh, I'm definitely a natural athlete. Yeah. Heavy immolation. (laughter) - Okay. So, for people who don't\nknow the EBI rules, it's an interesting rule\nstructure where the overtime, you put yourself in like\nthe worst possible position. And the task is to escape, and then the other person\ngets the same thing. What do you guys think\nabout that rule set? - I like it just because... First of all, I don't like the idea of having to put somebody on my back, but I do like the definitive\nanswer in the match. Like, either you escaped in time or you got, you know, written out. So the absolutely, like you have a, you get to the final winner. That's great. I'd much rather have that\nthan a close decision and it kind of goes the other way. - What about you? - I mean honestly, there's\nall the different roles. When I look at the role sets, I just try to think of what role set I could beat that individual in. And I sort of gear myself towards that. That's really the strategy there. I think there's some guys that like, that stall a lot, that you would love to have\nEBI overtime with at the end. You know, they're stalling until they have to give us a good position. But then there's some guys\nthat are so good in those positions I'm like, ooh, maybe\nwe just do a regular match, you know? - What are the rules in the streets? - The streets? No time limit. - Yeah, that's one of it. There's also like concrete\nand cars and stuff. - Concrete, biting. - Biting, yeah. Poking. Yeah. So, you don't like that rule set? Are there some people you\nwould prefer in the street as a rule set? - Me? Probably not. (laughter) I don't know though. EBI, I mean, it's tricky, you know? It depends on the opponent,\nwhich rule set I'd wanna do. - What about you Nicky Ryan, what do you think about\nthe rule set of EBI? Yeah, so I think EBI is\nvery good from a spectator point of view. You know, people find it\nvery entertaining to watch. You know, cause people\nwanna see submissions and you're putting people,\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Yqou're putting the athletes\nin a position where you know, you have like the highest percentage submission in the sport. So obviously, you're gonna\nget a lot of submissions. My issue with it is, it is a\nrule set that allows somebody that's overall worse at\njiu-jitsu to win a match. You know, a guy can go\nout there and just stall and just get completely dominated for the entirety of regulation, and then he gets to\nstart on the guy's back. So, that's my one issue with it. - But also, I mean isn't\nit interesting to see, like the best people in\nthe world have to be put in a really bad position? And to see how good their\nescapes are, for example. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah, I think-- - It's interesting.\n- [Nicky Ryan] Yeah. - But it doesn't feel like, realistic. It's a fun thing to watch, but it doesn't feel like the real fight. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah. - It feels weird. - I'll claim it, if I start an overtime on\nsomeone and finish 'em, I'll claim it. But if they submit me an\novertime I'm like, ahh. - You're gonna deny it. - It's not a real submission. - Good. (Lex chuckles) - The issue is people like stalling to just win the overtime. - Yeah. - So, where you got this guy, his whole training camp is just, not get subbed and win the overtime. It's a bit boring. - By the way, I have a a rose behind you. Somebody gave me a Valentine's flower. So, if you miss the one from\nGordon, I got one for you. - Well, I'd appreciate that. Thank you. (laughter) It's good to feel loved. - Yeah. All right. (chuckling) So, what did you learn from that match? Like, a takeaway as technically speaking? Like, what do you need to work on? - Well, I learnt that I\nam pretty good, and uh... (laughter) Yeah, pretty good. I got a, you know, a few-- I know exactly what my weakness is. You know, it's the leg lock department. And I'm doing a lot to, you know, get better in that specific aspect. - Attack in defense. - I would say, yeah. But attack, defense, re-attacks, even if I wanted to\noffensively enter a leg, you know, I could use\nsome work there as well. But I feel like once I solidify like my, like if I become a black belt specifically in the leg lock department, I feel like I'd be unstoppable. - If you, Nicky Rod,\ndefinitively beat Gordon Ryan, how would you do it? - Buggy choke. - Buggy Choke. - Buggy choke. For the listener, (soft laughter) I don't even know how\nto describe buggy choke. What's the definitive like,\nconclusion on that choke? Does it work? It's a choke that you do when you're in a, what's the opposite of a dominant, it's not submissive in\na non-dominant position of bottom of sight control. - Yeah. Just embarrassing submission\nto get caught with, really? - Yeah. But, does it work? - It works on certain people. (Nicky Ryan giggles softly) - For the listener, he\nglanced over at Nicky Ryan. It's embarrassing but it's also what? It's a way to frustrate the opponent. - For sure, yeah. It's a new part of the sport. I feel like the Ruotolo's\nbrought it back into fashion. And even if you don't get it, because it's one of those\nmoves that's so embarrassing, at the first sign of danger, the top guy abandoned ship. And you can basically retain God by attempting a very\nembarrassing submission. - So, the threat of embarrassment. - [Craig] Yeah.\n- To everybody. - People pull out very quick to avoid suffering the consequences. - I think some people underestimate how good of a submission it is. I mean like once you're locked in there, there's not too many\ndefenses for a buggy choke. - Are you... Is there an instruction on\nthe way from you on the-- - Jay Rod, actually, your\nlittle brother has one. - Oh yeah? For real? You actually legit have.. Oh, wow. (laughter) That's awesome. We'll check it out. So I mean, there is, I mean,\nyou're making a joke out of it, but it is real, like,\nthere's a system to it. - I mean, yeah. I don't know if we'd call it a system. (laughter) It's a good move. - I mean, you take an\nopponent that was just winning in a greatly dominant\nposition and then boom, in that same position, they're\npretty much, they're losing. You know, it's an interesting move. - What's the name of the, what's the name of it? - [Male] It's called, The\nBuggypedia by Jay Rodriguez. - Okay. The Buggypedia. I thought there'd be something like, very Craig Jonesy about it. Okay, awesome. I know you don't want to\nsort of reveal the secrets of what you're working on. But in general, what does it take to beat Gordon? I guess, is the question.\n- Okay. So, it would've to be\nsome kind of a choke. I think any joint lock\nor anything like that, he's just gonna let it\nbreak and stay in the match. So, I don't even think he'd tap from like, a rear naked choke. I think I would have to put him to sleep. So, putting him to sleep is how I'd win. - So, Gordon is somebody\nwho really hates losing. - Yeah, like he won't even\ntap in the practice room. I remember like, I had a\ntoe hold a couple times in practice room, and\nhe was just comfortable like, working there. I'm like, I'm not really\nputting much on it. I think he just, you know, maybe because of situations\nlike that in practice, he kind of didn't respect\nmy toe hold's ability in competition. - You've done that to me in the practice. - I have, yeah.\n(Craig chuckles loudly) Yeah. I gave you a little, you know? - Gave me a little pop and then he let go. (chuckles) - That was only 10% right there. Imagine--\n(laughs) - [Craig] Hey, don't get into math. - [Nicky Rod] Ha ha! - [Lex] Okay. Is there some part of that\nyou think is necessary to be a champion as to like, this almost unwillingness\nin competition to tap? - I think there's definitely\nsomething to be said for people that are just like, you know, willing to go that extra mile, or to take that damage\nto secure their victory. - Is there part of you that like, would hate to tap or hate to tap? - Yeah. I mean, all of me would hate that. (laughter) Yeah. The whole part of me. - Isn't there a John\nLegend song like that? All of you and all of me? - Very romantic, yeah. - Yeah. Now, we're sticking on that theme. Okay, I'm sorry. (soft laughter) Oh, one of the things Gordon asked, - Uh oh. - I forget how you put it\nbecause I think there's a lot of words that would need\nto be censored involved. But he said, \"Ask them how it feels to have a zero five record against me with four submissions combined.\" - I mean, first of all, I wasn't sure he could count to five. - [Lex] Yeah. - That's an impressive thing. - [Lex] That's impressive. (Lex chuckling)\n- Oh and five. I mean, I will say one thing, nobody beats me four times. (soft laughter) - I love you so much, Craig. - I did have a question. I did have a question for you. There was some controversy\non your Twitter. - [Lex] Yeah. - About a list of books. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I was wondering why Gordon's book wasn't\nfeatured amongst that literature? - Well, it was only the first 30 books or like the first 20 books. And it would of course be in the-- - Something interesting about Gordon, he's the first author that's written more books than he's read. - Pretty good. (laughter) If you face him and beat him, what's your take on what\nit takes to beat Gordon? I mean, you guys are kind of joking, they go pretty hard\nrecently on each other. But as a fan of jiu-jitsu,\nI'm all in on this rivalry. It's just fun to watch. - I mean, first of all, I don't think I go really hard with him. I think Gordon is, he's pretty sensitive,\nyou know what I mean? He's looking for a large\ninsult in a small insult. And for me, like Australians, we just attack each\nother, all day, every day. And for me, like if I see someone that\ntakes himself very seriously, that's like blood in the water. That's funny to me. To me, if I can just gently provoke and get a strong reaction, that's hilarious. Like Aussies, we'll just attack each other, and the first person that gets upset, he kind of loses the exchange. So, I think that is\nvery, very entertaining. - Like if you were to beat Gordon, would the mental game off\nthe map be part of it? - I think it would be a factor for sure. But I mean, I'm never gonna come out too crazy direct with him. You know? Like I don't, I can't, I find that like if you\nget too upset online and you're going crazy, I find that-- I'd be embarrassed to do that myself. Obviously, everyone's different. Everyone has a different style, you know? But like, yeah, I think mental, the mental aspect would play a big factor. I mean, mainly because\nif I were to beat him, I would send him a message\nevery day until I died. - [Lex] Yeah. - Just to gently remind him\nthat I got the last one. The last one. It's all that matters. We're not keeping score here.\n- Win it back. - Yeah, we're not keeping score. - So like, once you beat him, you're going to run for\nthe rest of your life. - I mean run, but look back. - Yeah.\n- You know? Look back and laugh. - Run with messages or something. - A sidestep. - Ride your horse to into the sunset. Okay. Well by the way, you've\ntalked very lightly. You've talked shit very lightly against Alexander Volkanovski's\nopponent, very lightly. Have you received death threats or, how are you still alive? - Like Gordon, I would say people from\nDagastan take a joke very well. You know what I mean? - Do they really? Do they really?\n- No. (laughter) - Oh, I was waitin' for you. Oh, sorry. I'm slow. I'm way too aggressive mode in my head. - Now honestly,\n- [Lex] Half listening to you. - Islam is pretty cool. I wanted to stir it up a bit, you know? Cause like I felt like\nthat was a massive fight and it probably should\nhave added more attention than it was receiving. So, I wanted to just\ngently stir it up a bit. I feel like Sambo guys\nare in the same lane as catch wrestlers. Very sensitive. You know, like obviously,\nthere's only three people in the world that do catch wrestling. Sambo, maybe 10 to 15. So, I figured we could really\nprovoke them with that sort of jiu-jitsu sambo stuff. Islams took the jokes very well. The Russian fans not so much. They're very serious. There's not many smiles\nin Russia, you know? They didn't take it as well. - I'm trying to suppress the anger. The rage is building inside me, slowly."

      "text": "So, you guys mentioned steroids. - I like that you bring that\nup after we talk about Russia. For the record. Smooth, smooth segue there. - I did not condone the\nstatements said by the Aussie. But, I would love to\ntravel with you to Russia. - That would be a good time.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - You might get killed with me, now. - No, I would be like the\nfirst to turn to backstab you. (laughter) - Like I got him. - All right. Are most of the top grapplers on steroids? - I mean, it's hard to say. You know, some people look like shit and they're on steroids. Some people look excellent\nand they're not on steroids. It's so, so hard to tell. - But that seems to be\nthe general consensus, that a lot of people on steroids. I'm always a little bit, I don't know, so I'll be honest, I've never\nseen anyone take steroids. I've never taken steroids. I don't even know if that's\nthe right term to use or like TRT, any of that. So, I'm very careful like,\nto not let my naivete like, lead me to take conclusions. But, I do feel a little bit\nweird about the witch hunt nature of it. That some people a little\nbit too eagerly claim that others are on steroids just\nbecause they're successful. But at the same time, it does\nseem that a lot of athletes will do whatever it\ntakes to be successful. - Yeah, I mean if a sport doesn't test, you gotta assume most\npeople are gonna do it. And especially now, as more\nmoney comes into the sport, you gotta assume more people\nare gonna do it, you know? - But generally, like, do ADCC and like, does jiu-jitsu test? - [Craig] It's actually encouraged. - What's encouraged?\n- No, I'm kidding. - You get a pamphlet. Okay. They don't test? There's no testing? - They test to make sure we're on steroids cause obviously it's a big show for the UFC five plus in the future. (laughter) You don't want anyone\ncoming in outta shape. - [Lex] Very nice. Do you think using steroids\nin that kind of context in sports is wrong? Like stepping away if it's not illegal? - [Craig] I mean, from my perspective. - Do you think ethically speaking? - I like to assume everyone's on steroids so I have to feel bad about\nusing steroids myself. - Yeah.\n(soft laughter) Do you use all of the steroids? - I'm over 30. It's TRT, you know, that's\nthe medical definition. (giggling) - That's the medical def-- Okay. I'd like to meet your doctor. - [Craig] Therapeutic use, you know. - Therapeutic, right. Like, how do you just feel about it? - I mean, it is cheating for sure, whether they test for it or\nnot, I think it is cheating. Obviously some people are gonna say, \"Oh fuck it, everyone's on it. I should be able to get away with it.\" Makes it even playing field. You know? But it kind of becomes Russian\nroulette cause it's like, if one guy's taking a small amount, and the other guy is taking a huge amount, he's gonna reap huge\nrewards in the short term. Probably be dead, pretty early. But die a champion, mind you. You know what I mean? So it's like, I don't know where line is yet. - Yeah. What do you think about that? Do you think it's worthy\nto take health risks just for the glory? - I think if you're 40, about to die, looking at a cabinet of gold\nmedals for wrestling other men, it's probably not gonna hit\nthe same way on your death bed. You know? - What? Sorry. In which direction? Like, is that a good thing or not? - No. You're probably gonna feel like, \"Oh fuck, I probably wasted\na bit of health on that.\" You know?\n- You think so? Isn't that like the glory of it? Like you said, other men? Yeah. (Craig chuckles)\n(soft laughter) Yeah, yeah. - Well, I mean, in my opinion, I'll maybe rest of a woman as well, but. - What'd you do with\nGabby on Valentine's Day? Where did you take her? What'd you guys-- - We filmed some new stuff for Only Fans. - [Lex] For Only Fans. - [Craig] We never stop working. - So, the love affair\nis also a work affair. Okay. I don't know. There's something too that made like... Like Olympic gold medalist\naccomplishing like the heights sacrificing everything. Just everything. The first 20, 30 years of your life for this silly little piece of metal. I don't-- I think there's something\nbeautiful to that. That like, conspires a\nlot, a lot of people. And that's like the height of\nthe human condition in a way. - What did you survive? I'm just saying if you're in\nyour death bed early in life. - We all die. All men die, Craig Jones.\n(Craig chuckles loudly) But, not all men truly live. - How many years are\nyou willing to shave off for a gold medal? - That's a good question. How many? How many are you willing to\nshave off for a gold medal? What year for silver medal? - For silver. I mean for a silver medal,\nI'd shave a few off. - I think two silvers makes a gold, so. (laughter) - It's worth five years. - Five to ten maybe, yeah. Shave off the bad years and\nhaunts the good ones, you know? - Well, I mean, you've sacrificed, you guys sacrificed a\nlot, a lot of your life. You continue to sacrifice. Or you don't see it as sacrifice? - It's fun. I think training's fun,\nbeing bit adamant about it. Consistent. I mean, I think we have a\ngreat routine, great ritual. Definitely enjoy the process. - All right. Well, do you guys know, this is bro science. Or I'm talking bro scientist, but do you know how long\nsteroids stay in your system? - Forever? - Forever. Oh, because it's like-- - Hey, once you do it, y'all want it. (laughter)\n- Yeah. Just the knowledge. Yeah. All right. - I think it's different\nfor each steroid, right? I think some of 'em\nlast longer than others. It depends if it's a year. - You would think I would do\na little research before this, asking these questions. Why do you think most athletes and coaches don't talk about steroids? Like, why is it such a, like a secret? Why is it so embarrassing? - I think they probably\ntalk about it like, amongst the team and whatnot. Again, I mean, it's gonna be\nmore shady if it's like a, your sport is tested or not. We're kind of in the Wild West, in the grappling world, you know? - Yeah. But why don't grapplers talk about it? Because the team's cheating. - I mean, it's kind of\ninsinuated as a bit of cheating. Even if it's not, like, if it's not tested, I mean, still, you're taking a\nperson that could, you know, maybe has good jiu-jitsu, good mechanics, you're putting 'em on the leg\nand they're subbing you with a heel hook versus breaking\nyour leg with a heel hook. You know, something as\nsubtle as that can make, you know, big differences. - All right. This is gonna make me sound dumb, but is it possible that steroids are not a huge help in grappling? - I think if you're bad at\njiu-jitsu and you do steroids, you're gonna continue\nto be bad as jiu-jitsu. But if you're great at gear, I'm sorry, if you're great at grappling, (laughter) If you're great at grappling\nand then you also do gear, it's gonna enhance what\nyou're already, you know, good at and make you much better. - But like how much is the enhancement? I guess is the question? - How much is muscle valued? - Right.\n- Like if you're, - That's the question. - If you're doing gear and you're not changing weight that much, like maybe it helps you a little bit. But if you know, you're gaining\n50, 60 pounds of pure muscle and it's like, that's a huge enhancement. That's another human. - Does muscle-- A small human, yeah. Does muscle matter in jiu-jitsu? I guess is the question. Is it possible that it gets in the way? - I'd say muscle matters,\nbut technique matters more. - I also think that it'll help you develop technique as well. Because obviously, you know, testosterone\nhelps with recovery rate. So if you're on gear, you're\nable to train a lot more. Now with that being said,\nif you're not able to learn, obviously it's not gonna\nhelp in that aspect. But, if you're somebody\nthat knows how to learn and get good at jiu-jitsu, and then you add gear on top of that, you're able to do\nsignificantly more sessions throughout the week. - Okay. And by the way, gear is steroids? - [Nicky Ryan] Steroids, yeah. - Okay. - I also think that you don't\nhave to be as consistent in like your sleep, in\nyour food and stuff, if you're on gear. You have a little bit of leeway. But I mean, being consistent\nin your diet and your sleep definitely would help,\nyou know, the process. - Since you use most steroids, - Most steroids, yep. - of any athlete I've ever met, do you think steroids help jiu-jitsu? Oh man. - I think obviously it helps recovery and your ability to train more. But I think some, I've seen some guys go on steroids and then suddenly they feel\nlike the incredible Hulk and now in the training room, they start to rely more on strength, - [Lex] Yeah. - than the techniques they had. And it actually in some respect, hinders them, and makes\n'em gas more in competition cause then they're\nusing more of the muscle they never used to have. - So, you've implied that\nyou're a natural athlete. - Mmhm. - [Craig] You said that, you said that skeptically. (laughter) Why are you skeptical Lex? (laugher) - Is this something you\ndo for social media, to talk shit to Gordon, to imply that he's not a natural athlete? - Well, I only pretty much\nrecently on social media I had this rebuttal, you know? Saying that, you know, Gordon's on gear. And I only said that\nbecause after our match in our most recent match. You know, the EBI rules match, he accused me of greasing,\nwhich is like lubing up. So, I'm slippery during our match, so. - And you and you did not? - I did not. I was checked multiple\ntimes before and after our grappling event. And he still, you know, went\nout and accused me of this. So, I was like, all right, as opposed to telling a lie,\nI'll just tell the truth about, you know, your steroid use. Which it shouldn't be that\nbig of a deal in retrospect cause he kind of admitted it and whatnot, you know, previously. So, it's yeah, I just kind of felt\nlike I had to rebuttal. And I didn't do it immediately\ncause I was like, all right. I know I have this podcast\nplanned so I'll wait to do it on, you know, my friend, Mark Bell's podcast. You know, could be a little more, get a little bit more exposure on it. - Sure. - And yeah, I knew he\nwas gonna bite the bait. But I didn't think he was gonna, you know, bite the bait that hard. I know he's a little stressed\nout about the comment, but, you know. - And that was the origin of you guys going back and forth on, - Well it wasn't so much\nback and forth, it was just, I went forth and then he\nkept going back, back, back. Like, I remember one of my guys\nDM'd me and they were like, \"Gordon's made like 68 Instagram stories, and 67 of them were all about you.\" I was like, all right, well\nI'm in his head for sure. - Got us a few followers. We appreciate that. - We did get followers. Even shouted out our\nB-Team White Belt Program. So, thank you.\n(chuckles) - Yeah. (chuckles) Okay. Speaking of which, what's the B-Team? How's it run? And why is it called the B team? - Well, I mean Craig named it. - Was the A-Team taken?\n(laughter) - I would've picked. For me, B is for best. - Okay. Best. All right. What does B stand for, for you? What does it represent? What is the ideal like the, you know, Miyamoto Musashi, philosophical\nfoundation of B-Team? - Aim low and achieve.\n- Hm. If the bar is set low,\nyou can't help but win. Okay. - That's Nicky's philosophy\nwith women as well. (Nicky laughs) Set the bar incredibly low. Overachieve. - So, what is the B-Team? How do you guys run it? Like what's, yeah, I mean can you just talk about\nthe school, how you found it? What is it? What's it like? - I mean, pretty much just\na regular jiu-jitsu gym. We started a as sort of a pros only purple belt and above team. And we have me, Nicky\nRod, Nicky Ryan, Ethan, Damien as coaches. Am I missing someone? - Oh, JB. - Your memory,\n- [Craig] JB. - with your old age. - Impeccable memory, yeah. And we got JB coming on\nto teach white belts. But just your stock\nstandard jiu-jitsu team. We focus on more, we lean heavily towards the professional athlete side of things. We have a lot of high level guys in there. - [Lex] Yeah. - Class structure, regular instruction and positional sparring open rounds. But we sort of took a\nheavy slant on marketing side of things. We really try to blow\nup the YouTube channel. Obviously, we sell a lot of\nclothing, merchandise and stuff. So yeah, we just sort of\ntook a modern approach to a standard jiu-jitsu\ngym because I mean, jiu-jitsu gyms are full\nof some of the most boring human beings on earth. So, we try to highlight. - Strong words, Craig Jones, strong words. - Highlight the other\nside of things, you know? Keep it pretty lighthearted. - [Lex] That it can be fun.\n- Yeah. That jiu-jitsu can be fun. I guess that it can be cool too. You know, it's not just\nfull of steroided up autistic people, you know? - Question from Reddit, quote, \"Need to hear some of the\nstories about drop-ins that led to the making\nof the gem of a video, 'The Dos and Don'ts of\nTraining a B-Team.'\" Any fun stories? - Any ones that stands out? Do you guys remember any? - Police involved ever? - We had a guy coming\nabout to kick him out. He was stalking two of the members. Yeah, well I mean, there's\njust crazy people, you know? Like, I portray a pretty\ninsane image online, and I guess I am that, a lot of the time But at training, try to\nkeep it, while training. Around training I'm insulting everyone. But while training, I try to keep it pretty serious. But obviously, the image\nof a Trey Lu is in some of the crazier members. - I mean like the thing is\nabout the gym you guys run is really professional. It's like friendly. It's like the lighthearted\njoking is there obviously. You know, like shit talk\nand all that kind of stuff. But like, it's a pretty safe environment. - [Craig] Yeah, cause-- - But the public persona\nmight attract some-- - Some maniacs.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I won't say which\nplaces I've trained at, but obviously there's some\nplaces you walk into the room and it's very, very serious.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - There's no smiles around. Obviously, it's pretty an\naverage training room in Russia, but no smiles. Very serious environment, you know what I mean?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And I definitely totally like that. I don't wanna show up to training and be walking on eggshells, not knowing what the\ncoaches' moods like that day. I wanna go in, have a good time. Keep it lighthearted. - What was in the video? What are the dos and don'ts? Because like the address is\npublic, like anyone can show up. - Anyone can show up. Yeah. What were the dos and don'ts? - Does anyone challenge you? Like, to a fight? - Not yet. Not yet. I mean, probably from other gyms in town, that's probably coming down the line. But, dos and don'ts-- - I'm all in on that. I would be excited as a fan to just watch. - [Craig] I love the drama. - Not the drama. No, no, no. Well, a little drama, a\nlittle drop of poison is good. But ultimately, it's the\nbest grapplers in the world kind of going at it, yeah. And it's fun. Because, maybe I'm wrong, but I think there is an\nunderlying deep camaraderie at the end of the day. When you're like at the top of the world. - [Craig] Yeah.\n- And you're like in the same town. - What could possibly go wrong? - It's like a shitty Western, but like an epic Western. Where like, Clint Eastwood with like, \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\". Of course I love it. I'm here just eating popcorn like that. - Stirring the pot. - I'm not stirring the pot.\n(laughter) I'm not staring the pot. - These questions are from\nReddit, but not from you. (laughter) - That one for sure. - Yeah. I mean, what could possibly go wrong if you are the world's best\ngrappler hates you and you are gently provoking him behind\nthe scenes every day? Well I mean,\n- For sure. In Texas. - And you've stolen his\nbrother, held him for ransom. - Kidnapped. It is like a story of a\nshitty Western, I think."

      "section": "White belts",
      "text": "You now allow white\nbelts to train with you. What's it like to open it\nup to a bigger audience? - We haven't opened it up yet, but it'll be interesting to see. I mean, I feel like your higher belts, they really understand\nwhat the training room is, you know what I mean? White belts early, they're trying to find\ntheir place in the gym, could be kind of awkward and\nstuff in that environment. So, I think obviously\nthose white belts coming in will change the dynamic. But the white belts will have\na separate white belt classes obviously for 'em. Cause given it's such a high level gym, it'd be tough a beginner\nto be able to enter the more advanced classes. Well obviously, we're teaching\nmore advanced techniques. So yeah, we've separated\na white belt program, I believe 6:00 PM,\n- Yeah. - Monday to Friday. Yeah, maybe we'll have\na Saturday one as well. But, it'll be interest to see how it goes. We're trying to do things\ndifferent, you know? Like, we're trying to do your traditional jiu-jitsu\ngyms, obviously you're not gonna teach beginners wrestling at all. We're trying to split it\nat least 33% top game, bottom game, and wrestling. So, at least create more\nwell-rounded athletes from day one. Whereas, I feel like most\ntraditional jiu-jitsu gyms might have No-Gi once a week. They don't touch wrestling\nvery IBJJF heavy techniques. But again, the sport's changing for sure. - Just to take that on. How does a beginner get good at jiu-jitsu? Like given that you're\nstarting this white belt, what's your philosophy on that? - Obviously buy all of my instructionals. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- At full price. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Not during a sale. - [Lex] Okay.\n- That would go a long way. - For those of you who are\nRussians, I'll give you, I'll send you instructions, or all the forms, so you\nknow how to steal it. - [Craig] Yeah, a discount card. - I bought 'em all so I'll\njust send it to you for free. - I mean, we do have the\nMakhachev 50 discount code, you know? - [Lex] Yeah. - Offering discounts to help\nhim out for the rematch. - Nice. (laughing)\nMakhachev discount. Well, I got a hundred\npercent discount for you if you need it. But, that aside, your instructional are both hilarious and brilliant. And it's one of the most respected\ninstructionals out there. - [Craig] Oh, thank you. - [Lex] With incredibly great names. - [Craig] Yeah, it probably\nloses me Silas honestly, if you're removing seriousness of the-- - [Lex] Oh, cause they think\nit's gonna kind of suck. It's gonna be some funny gimmicky thing? - [Craig] Or, I mean, some\npeople don't even know if it's a real product. (Lex laughs) That's a big hurdle I have to overcome. If they see it and they're\nlike, is that a real thing? That's a problem. But how does the white belt get good? I think they just, I mean\nyou just have to show up, just have to put in the effort, try to focus on using\ntechniques in training, rather than just fighting to the death. You know? Although, that is\nentertaining for us to watch, two white bells fight to the death. - [Lex] Yeah. But, what are the techniques\nyou should focus on? Like, what's the process,\nwhat does it mean to show up? Like, how much drilling,\nall that kind of stuff? Like, if you were to\noptimize the first six months of a beginner. There's a lot of people\nwho would listen to this and haven't tried, they've been curious. I have a lot of friends who haven't, who are like jiu-jitsu curious. They're constantly looking\nfor an excuse to start. - I think it's just gotta\nbe as simple as possible. You know? Like, we shouldn't be teaching\nmore advanced movements. I mean obviously, in the\ngrand scheme of things there's highly advanced techniques, and then there's slightly advanced. And I think, trying to teach those guys real specific positions, even like real specific types of guard, is just beyond them. I think the best way to learn\nis through problem solving. And I think if you show the\ntechnique before they've discovered that problem, the\nlearning is sort of held back. So, I like the idea of\nusing kids style games to show them a problem and\nthen use the techniques to fix the problems\nthey've just discovered. I think that's the best way to learn. - Can you give an example of a problem to show them before you\ngive them the techniques? Like, what are we talking about. - All right, so say you wanted to teach posture in wrestling. You could create a game where one guy, the game might be get to\na leg or get to two legs, control the leg. Like, super simple. But the rules, the constraint would be one guy is forced to keep upper posture\nand one guy is forced, well not forced, but he's allowed to keep a bent\nof the hips, lower posture. And obviously within that constraint, the guy with the better posture is going to have more success. He's gonna have a better posture to secure a leg or secure both legs, and therefore, you've\ndemonstrated the flaws of bad posture without\nhaving to explain it to 'em before they really tested that out. - Okay. And then the result of\nthat you would realize that the bent over posture is better. - Yeah, you have that Aha moment rather than just being having been spoken to. - You wrote Craig, \"I'm a big fan of\nconstraint based learning,\" I guess, was what you're talking about. \"I love presenting\nbeginners with a problem before the solution. Like here, attempt to hold side\ncontrol with no cues on how. Then I see how the guy got out and address issue by issue. Crossface and hemp control and so on. Okay, so what are some other examples? Like side control? - Yeah, that would be an\nexcellent one, side control. Like obviously, we say\noh you secure a crossface so they can't turn into you. Much easier to have them\ntry to hold someone down without explaining what a crossface is, and then use that technique\nto address the problem they've just encountered. So, I think you could do that with a lot of areas of jiu-jitsu. Like even more advanced, say 50/50, obviously a mirrored position where you both have access\nto each other's heels. Most people will stall\nout in that position and keep their feet crossed. I think a great constraint\nfor both of them, you can't cross your feet. Now, you have to learn how to slip the heel hook when they expose it, and how to safely re-attack of your own. So, the constraint is you\ncan't be too defensive in that position. And I think the rate\nof learning increases. - Why do you think the\nrate of learning increases? Like, why do you think that works? - Because you encounter more problems. Say in that situation, they're\ngonna get you heal a lot more in whatever period of time\nyou allocate the drill for than if the legs are crossed. I don't think the hard\npart's splitting the legs to get to the submission. I think the hard part's practicing control while they're trying to\nslip it at a later stage. And then obviously,\ntrying to slip your heel when you're in more danger. So, it makes you more\ncomfortable in that bad position, if you're used to doing it with open legs. - Yeah, I think that probably\nthat style of teaching forces people to focus on. Cause it's so easy to fall into\nfocusing and like memorizing a particular details of a technique without thinking like, why\nthe hell does this even work? - [Craig] Exactly, yeah.\n- And if you don't have that, you get to focus on like, from like, as cliche as it sounds, from first principles. Like, why the hell? How the hell do I get out of this? Like, why does this even work? Why does wrestling work? Why do you have a bent over posture? You get to like start to ask\nthose kinds of questions. Which is kind of interesting\ncause it's not obvious to me that bent over posture\nis the right posture for jiu-jitsu, right? I'm confused actually about that. I don't know. - [Craig] About the correct posture? - Yeah, for jiu-jitsu. Like, what's the right answer? - I think bent over posture's\nstill good for jiu-jitsu. - Even with the judo and all of that. Like, why are so many jiu-jitsu people, like at a high level,\nthe posture is higher up? - Well, I think wrestling posture is just a bit too low because\nit's not necessary, right? If wrestlers are like\nlow enough to the ground where your hands could touch the mat. But in jiu-jitsu, you know, it's kind of a mix between\nlike wrestling and like, judo or Greco-Roman wrestling. So, I think it's just a bit more lax, and it's bent over but it's not upright. And it's also not super low, you know? - Bit more room for error too, because obviously the jiu-jitsu guy's shot isn't gonna be as athletic\nor as quick as a wrestler, especially a wrestler who shoots. - So, it actually comes down to the fact that jiu-jitsu people just on average, even at the top level, are not good at shooting. - I think so, yeah. I think obviously, I mean, all the wrestlers\nin America and stuff, they're starting super early, super young. You know what I mean? By the time they get to\nthe same age we are really, in our sport and stuff, they've spent much longer\ndoing the actual sport than the average jiu-jitsu guy. - And then there's another\nlevel of wrestling of course, with the Soviet block, that was just unachievable for your kind. - Who knew an Australian rugby, - [Lex] Yeah. - A former rugby player. - Rugby, is that kind of\nlike American football, but much less money? Is that what that is? - Much less money. Much tougher, I would say. But, who knew that the cure"

      "text": "to the Dagestani wrestling\nwere the Aussies? - Was the Aussies? Okay, let's go there. (laughter) Your friend, your training\npartner, Alexander Volkanovski, you helped him prepare\nfor the Islam Makhachev versus Volkanovski fight. Who do you think, first\nof all, won that fight? - That's a tricky one. - How is that the tricky question? - [Craig] I will say, when I was-- - Of all the shit talk you've been doing, how is that The tricky question? - When I was in the corner\ngoing into the fifth, I personally believed\nlive that Volkanovski probably needed a finish\nto take the victory. - But you have to think that way, right? In general? Or do you like legitimately, - It's a gray area cause\nthe judging, who knows? Plus I was like, wait, we're in Australia, where's this bias? You know?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - We've got some Australian judges here. - [Lex] Yeah. - I was really hoping we\nget a bit of bias on that. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Unfortunately, not. Hopefully, they lose their jobs. But, again yeah, it was a close one. I think sometimes you're\nblinded in the moment because again, everyone counted Volkanovski out. The crowd's behind him. So, everything he does is\ngonna get a huge cheer. You're bias towards the smaller guy. You're bias towards the underdog. So, you're sort of, whatever the underdog does has\na bigger impact in your mind. And sometimes that can bias\nas the fight goes along. But yeah, super, super close fight. I would really love\nthem to have a rematch. But obviously, that's gonna\nhold up both divisions. So, I don't know if\nthey'll be able to do it. - Do you think they'll do a rematch soon? I mean, that was an epic fight. I was listening to the\nfight companion during that. - They all thought-- - And so, they biased\nstrongly, the opinion. - Round two is the tricky one. - [Lex] Yeah. - Round two is the tricky one. - Anyway, I'd love to see\nthat like, run it back and do three, actually. There's an epic fight. What was the brief conversation you had with Islam Makhachev and his team? - I didn't know how he\nwould take the joke. Cause obviously Khabib\ntried to flying eagle kick Dillon Danis in the face. So, I wasn't sure how my humor would go. - [Lex] Yeah. But, I mean Dillon must have\nsaid some worse things to me. I was just playing around. I mean, you can't really\ntake anything I say serious. - [Lex] Yeah. - Come across like an idiot. But, so when he was coming up\nto me afterwards I was like, oh, I don't know what he's gonna say. And again he maybe he\nwould've been more upset if he had lost, but he had just received the judge's decision.\n- Yeah. - But he came up, I\nwent to shake his hand, he gave me a big hug and\nthen pretended to throw me. And then, I thought the\ninteraction was over, and then he circled back. So, that's why I was so awkward. I was like, oh, he's coming back. He wants to say, he wants something else. But he just said, why didn't you teach\nyour boy how to escape the body triangle? - Oh, wow. Interesting. What did you say to that? - I said well I mean,\nobviously, you've gotta learn how to finish a rear naked choke. - Is that what you said? - No, I didn't say that. (laughter) Just laughing, I was laughing. By the end of the day,\nthey ushered us out. They were like, \"Get out of here before the Aussie crowd attacks here.\" You know? - What do you think about\nthe body triangle position they were in? It seemed like for the first time, it seems almost like Welk was\ndominant in that position, which is kind of weird. - I mean damage is meant to Trump control. MMA judging damage is\nthe number one factor. - Do you think the judges saw that? What did they score that as? - I think they all scored\nfour towards Islam. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Three and five. Two of the judges scored towards Volks. One of the judges scored three for Islam. One of the-- It was 49-46 for one of them. And the other ones were 48-47. I think the... Again, the confusing round was round two. I don't think anyone scored\nthe body triangle round for Volks, which I wish they had. - Volkanovski was and is still\narguably, pound for pound, greatest fighter in the world. How long have you known him? - I don't know the first-- I met him before he was in the UFC, when I used to live in Melbourne. He came down to train at Absolute. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then we really\nconnected on Ultimate Fighter. One of his guys who was\ngonna bring to a fighter, Brad Riddell, pulled out last second. So, he called me when I was\nin Puerto Rico, and he's like, \"Do you want to coach on\ntough for five weeks?\" And like I said, Puerto\nRico was apocalypse now. I was like yeah, get me out of here. So, I jumped on that opportunity, and we were in Vegas five weeks together. Cause he was meant to fight Ortega. And then he got hit with Covid real bad. Got stuck in, I think he was in hospital\nfor maybe one to two weeks. And then before he flew back\nto Australia, they were like, all right, maybe we just do you guys as the Ultimate Fighter coaches. So, I jumped on board with that. And that's really when we've become close. - [Lex] Yeah. - Obviously, I was useful\nin the Ortega fight. Helped him get out of submissions. He fought then Korean\nzombie, Max Holloway. I basically just held\nthe bucket at that point in the corner. Couple striking fights And then again, yeah, we had\nto tackle the Islam problem. So, I did spend five\nto six weeks down there preparing for that. - How did you tackle the Islam problem? - How did I tack-- - Was you, somebody who\nbarely knows anything about wrestling, having to-- - Helps he doesn't take much, you know? - [Lex] Yeah. - Especially, wrestling wrestling. - Did the beard help or like, what? Like, in all seriousness, what were some of the key\nideas that you worked on with Volkanovski to prepare for it? - I had the help of Frank Hickman. Hickman was down there too, one of the Hickman\nbrother's wrestling coach. So, we were sort of like, problem solving and I mean basically, we were confident in Volk's\nfence wrestling, his cage work. He's super good on the cage, super like, under\nrespected in that position. And we knew that if you were able to take the scrambles to the cage, he would be effective against Islam. Cause again, Islam is background in Sambo\nof freestyle wrestling. But I mean, honestly, he's probably got the same\nexperience on the cage as Volks. Obviously, some of those wrestling skills will translate very well to the cage, but the cage is still somewhat\nof a gray area, an equalizer. And Volks, again, incredible\nability to stand up. Incredible defense on\nthe cage, which you saw. We worked on strategies to get up, and a ton of submission defense. Islam loves Kimuras, obviously\nrear naked from the back, arm bars, those are sort of-- And arm triangles dominant submissions. But again, the guys he\nsubmitted, not grapplers. Apart from Charles Oliveira. And again, Charles Oliveira\nwas basically knocked out at that point. So, I was still impressed\nwe submitted him. But again, I always told people this, they thought it was crazy. I was like, Charles Oliveira versus Islam at a grappling match. Oliveira is gonna win that match. - [Lex] Like submission grappling. - Submission grappling. Yeah. So, in pure, grappling is a skillset. I think Oliveira's a\nmore dangerous grappler. So, we didn't even come into\nit thinking Islam was this unstoppable boogeyman that\npeople make him out to be. So, we approached it from that, just focused on the techniques, ability to get back up,\nusing turtle to get back up. Using turtle to scoot to\nthe cage to get back up, and hand fighting from there. Keeping it pretty safe. But what makes Volks so special\nI think is his gas tank. Gas tank and his willpower. He's just unbreakable. The Dagestani guys, Khabib, Islam, they are good at submissions. But,\n- [Lex] Okay. - They break guys mentally. And they fatigue 'em, and then they take the\nsubmission that's offered. Oliveira is a guy that\ncan jump on submissions, and have an incredible technical ability to finish those submissions, whether you're fresh or you're tired. And then you combine\nthat with Volkanovski, who incredible willpower,\nnever gets tired, you're never gonna break him. And as you saw, he only\nattempted one submission, the whole fight. - Is that learned? Is that trained? Or are you just born with\nthat mental toughness? - It's a good question. I mean he's like an anomaly. Like, the entire fight\ncamp, not nervous at all. Supremely confident. The whole fight week,\ncompletely confident. He just has an attitude like, \"Oh, everyone cast me out? We'll see.\" You know what I mean? Islam, he's like, let's see. - [Lex] No doubt.\n- No doubt at all. Super relaxed up until\nabout five minutes before, and then he starts to amp himself up. He's like, \"You are not taking\nthis belt from my family\". He gets into that sort of mindset. - [Lex] He actually says that out loud? - You can't teach that survival he did in the Ortega fight, you know? - Have you guys ever been like\npushed to the limit like that or broken in a grappling match? - I'll do it in practice. Like I'll push myself to like, you know, \"I think I my pass\nout or die or something.\" Like, as far as like how\ntired you get, you know, cause like, in a match, you-- - You try not to ever get\nclose to that in a match. - Yeah, you try to, cause you know, it's\nimportant to understand where you're exhaustion point is. But yeah, if you have to push\nto that limit in a match, you're probably doing something wrong. You know? Like, you've seen in\nmatches where guys sprint the last like minute, they try to win the\nmatch in the last minute, and it's like, you\ndefinitely had some mistakes leading up to that if\nyou have to, you know, gotta go balls to the wall. - Okay. But has there been ever\ntimes in competition? Especially like early\non cause you're like, you wrestled pretty hard and\nwrestling is pretty exhausting. Like, not wrestling but you know, wrestling style kind of thing. Going against the best\npeople in the world. - Yeah, I mean I definitely, Again, I think in\npractice it's important to do that hard work. That way, competition is much easier. You know, I think if you\nred line in practice, and you really pushed\nthrough like death's door, then once you're in competition\nand you're working with, you know, you're being fresh in a comp, I mean, it's much better. - Have you ever been to that thing where Dan Gable talks about,\nalways wanting to be to a place where you can't get off the mat? Like, when you work so\nhard in the training room, you can't get off the mat. I think he says he's failed\nat that in his career. He was always able to at\nleast crawl off the mat. - Yeah, I definitely never\nlike actually died on the mat. I felt like I was gonna die, you know? (chuckling) - Sure, sure. What about you? Do you quit all the time? - I get a leg cramp,\nI'm like, you know what, you got me in mount. Let's do this again tomorrow. (giggling) - Dude, if I'm asking Craig for a roll, he's in the bathroom somewhere. (laughter) - Do you see the value\nof pushing yourself? Like, to that place where\nyou're knocking on death's door? - Yeah, but it within safety, you know? Cause obviously the most serious injuries occur when you're tired over\ntraining and stuff like that. So, I think like taking a page outta what those MMA fighters do, especially\nVolks with his training. Like, he's not necessarily\npushing crazy in each round, but he's doing extra\nconditioning, assault bike stuff, crazy workouts outside. And he does do some\ncrazy training workouts, but all safe, very safe. Like when he's redlining like\nthat in the training room, it's a very controlled, safe setting. I think to do that in jiu-jitsu against some of these lunatics out there that are trying to kill you, especially when you have\na name, can be dangerous. - So, your approach is just is, don't warm up and don't try too hard. (chuckling) - [Craig] No certainty, but yeah. - For safety.\nNo, for safety though. (Craig chuckles)\n- Yeah. Longevity, you know? - And talk about Russians. (laughter)\nI got it, I got it. I hear you. Oh, but you mentioned cage work. What's interesting to\nyou that you've learned over all this time about cage work? What's like, what's interesting about\nthe dynamics of that? Are you talking about\nboth like the control in the dominant position,\nbut also getting up from the bottom while\nyou're at the guest cage? All of that? - The added dimension of that cage, that wool being there changes\na lot of stuff, right? So, obviously in some ways, it's a much lower impact wrestling style because you can't be sprawled on. You can shoot, the cage\nis gonna block their feet, you're gonna be able to\nchase down their hips. It's just a completely different fight. And again, because of Islam's judo skills, that upper body controls\nyou see he's able to use against the cage. Like the inside trips, sort of the Uchi Mata\nstyle, Hirajoshi throws. So, obviously those skills do translate. But yeah, I think the\ncage is a great equalizer for a lot of things like\nathleticism and stuff. It takes away a huge speed\nadvantage aspect of the fight. - So, he's really good at standing up. Is there, I assume he learned all\nof that from you and your instructional, \"Just Stand Up.\" - I mean we were so confident. I was like, you know what? Why don't we put this thing\nout a month before the fight? - [Lex] Yeah. - Maybe the illegal download hasn't made its way to Russia yet. - [Lex] Yeah. But, it was their for him. - Can you explain to me, what's in the instructional\n\"Just Stand Up?\" Like, what are the ideas? - I mean, the old school way to stand up people talk about the technical get up, you know the old Gracie, put the hand, but I mean, that doesn't work. It hasn't worked for 20 years, you know? If you look at everyone\nthat gets up at MMA, they're using turtle to get up, they're using wrestling to\nget up, you know what I mean? - [Lex] Yeah. - Which is counter to\nwhat pure jiu-jitsu says. They say don't expose the back,\ndon't ever expose your back. I think jiu-jitsu's a terrible\nway to get back to the feet because if you were to retain guard and go half guard or closed guard, super hard positions to get up, you're basically putting yourself in a leg tuck for wrestling. So, I think you need to\nborrow from wrestling to learn how to get up in an MMA fight. So, basically how to\nsafely expose your own back while not allowing them\nto get hooks and use that to get back up or at least not\nallow them to get two hooks. - And that applies for MMA especially? - For MMA especially, because obviously striking is a factor. But if they are striking, they don't have locked\nhands around your body, means you are able to move. You are able to make an\nattempt to get back up. They have to choose between\ncontrol, submission, or strikes. - Post from Reddit. \"Why does Craig Jones push so hard for a bottom is bad jiu-jitsu? What is so bad about playing bottom guards such as half guard or De La Riva?\" (chuckles softly) Those are the two options. - No one likes the bottom. - Why would I want to get up? Is the question for all of you. Is the bottom a bad place to be? - I mean, the bottom's bad\nif you don't want that guy on top of you. That's the way I look at it. You know? - Yeah. That sounds like something\na cowboy would say. But I don't know if that has much meaning. (light chuckling) I think the point of jiu-jitsu\nis both are dangerous, being on bottom and on top. - I think the longer the matches, probably favors the top guy more, just cause every movement\nthe bottom guy makes is probably carrying your weight, carrying that gravity on top of you. So, I think it's a bit more\nefficient passing from the top as opposed to sweeping from bottom. - Bottom's reactive, top is active. The top player decides how to engage, how to approach the guy. They can use angles,\nthey can use footwork, they can throw people, throw the legs by. So, it's an active position. Bottom's reactive. Reactive, you're gonna get fatigued. - Yeah, I think it's very\ndifficult to gas somebody out while playing guard. But I think it's very\neasy to gas somebody out when attempting to pass it. - Well, you guys are talking\nabout gassing people out, but is there more dangers from the bottom? Like, in terms of submissions and all that kind of stuff or no? - I'm back and forth\ncause I'm a top player, but I understand the\nvalue of being on bottom. Like when I do play guard, the bottom, I feel like the submissions\ncome much easier. And when I'm on top, they\ncome also pretty easy. But, maybe I just take a different route. (giggling) - Two cowboys talking about jiu-jitsu. - Top on the streets,\nbottom in the sheets. That's Nicky Rod.\n(Nicky Ryan giggles) - What was the hardest\npart of the training for the training camp for at Wal Kanowski? Like you're just experiencing\nworld class MMA fighters training and given your\napproach of jiu-jitsu of not trying to hard, no matter what. - [Craig] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean from my perspective, there's a lot of pressure for that. You know? Like, that's a lot of\npressure for me to go in and think that I could\npossibly figure out a way to help this guy address\nthis guy that's basically never been beaten. I think he got knocked out once, but, basically not really even\nbeen put in bad positions, you know what I mean? So, that's a lot of pressure on me. Especially cause Volkanovski\nis such a great guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - Jiu-jitsu's different, you know, like you coach a guy, he\nloses, he has time to tap, but he never make you gets severely hurt. - [Lex] Yeah. - There's a lot more weight in what you need to do as a coach. You have a greater sense of responsibility to their health and wellbeing. You know? Like obviously, I know Volks' kids, I know his wife, you know what I mean? They're putting faith in you\nto not just win the fight, but keep this man safe, you know? So, from my perspective, a hell of a lot more pressure coaching him as an MMA fighter. - So, almost like the\npsychological aspect of like, of doing the best you can for him. - Exactly. Yep, yep. - What was the hardest\nabout the actual training? Was it the technical aspect\nof trying to figure out the puzzle of Islam or was it like, being a good training partner in the... Like, in figuring out how\nthe grappling would work, basically playing your best\nimpression of Makhachev. Were you trying to\nactually impersonate him? Like not just visually, but like in style. - Yeah, definitely. Definitely, visually. - You're not as good looking but go ahead. - Ha, a little taller, but--\n- [Lex] All right. - No, in terms of the training, yeah, I mean Islam's known as\nincredibly strong guy, so obviously, I'm heavier than Islam. So theoretically, I should\nbe able to replicate that strength difference, And then in terms of grappling, targeting those submissions\nthat Islam does, like focusing on those\nin the training room, focusing on the way he holds half guard. And really fo--- In the grappling sense, trying to replicate him on the ground. And then, yeah, I wrestle with him on the wall\na ton, trying to replicate, obviously to the best of my ability, a lot of the stuff he does on the wall. Body lock heavy, inside trip, Uchi Mata's. And just constantly put\nin the work on Volks, you know what I mean? Like, constantly chaining\nattacks against him. Really replicating that. - As he's trying to get up and escape and all that kind of stuff. So, all these submissions\nlike, both judo and submissions just attacking, attacking.\n- Exactly. And there's only so much he can do really, cause obviously he's been, I think he's been fighting a long time. So, it's like you are trying to polish what he already is good at. You can't just completely\ncreate an entirely new game for him in the space of six weeks. So, you're trying to take what\nhe's already effective at, add to it. And luckily a lot of the stuff\nhe's already very good at was easy to add to for the fight. - Question from Reddit, \"I'm very curious why other MMA fighters don't employ high profile\ngrapplers from B-Team and New Wave to improve their grappling. That's from the sub-writer. \"By now it's clear that\nthey are levels above almost everyone in MMA simply\nbecause fighters there don't specialize in grappling. But, it doesn't seem like\nfighters, even champions, get training partners from\nthe most successful teams. Why is that the case?\" From your experience, why doesn't Khabib call you? - He might now.\n(chuckles) (Lex chuckles) Put in a good word for me. - Oh, oh I will. Yeah. (laughter) - That's right. He takes a joke pretty well. - [Lex] Yeah. - No, you'll be welcome with open arms. (Craig laughs) - I think your average jiu-jitsu coach, MMA fighters have bad\nexperience with jiu-jitsu guys. Jiu-jitsu doesn't have\na massive place in MMA. Obviously, rounds, standups. It's hard to submit people. Your average Brazilian\njiu-jitsu black belt doesn't know anything\nabout holding a guy down, doesn't know anything\nabout how to stand up. - [Lex] Sure. - So, I think if you over overly\nutilize that jiu-jitsu guy, that hasn't had experience\nin more modern No-Gi, or training MMA fighters previously, it's gonna be a complete\nwaste of time to 'em. I think they're smart\nenough to realize that. - Do you have, and do you guys, do you have interest in MMA at all? Just not even like, well certainly, just competing yourself. But like, just understanding\nthe puzzle of MMA? - Yeah, I mean, I've been a\nfan of mixed martial arts, you know, for a very long\ntime before I trained jits. Personally, I'd much\nrather coach than fight. But I mean, I'd fight somebody for, you know, a good check and\nI get to pick the opponent. And have a proper camp. - Okay. (laughs) - I can think of a good\nopponent, you know? - Which dude was that? All right. (laughter)"

      "text": "Who do you think is the greatest\nMMA fighter of all time? Craig, we can start with you. Just as a fan of the sport, as somebody who's been deep in it. - I mean, from my perspective,\nafter that performance, I'm gonna say Volkanovski\nbecause he was able to decisively outstrike Max Holloway, one of the greatest strikers in the sport. - [Lex] Yeah. - [Craig] And he was able\nto hang with the wrestling of Islam Makhachev. And in terms of Ortega, he was able to survive Ortega, who has some of the most dangerous\nsubmissions in jiu-jitsu. So, I think in my opinion, technically, he's the best. - So even though, he technically\nlost, he still has a crown. - [Craig] I believe so.\n- Proven himself, - Given the size difference, given he's moving up in weight. - [Lex] Yeah. - I think all those factors really. - The underdog, everything, the pressure. - Did you think he\nwould be able to hang in any of the wrestling exchanges with Islam? - No, no, no. I was really surprised. That's why my eyes like, it's kind of funny. Like, winning at the end of the day, I feel like judges influenced that. Although, I did think\nAustralian judges would, would rob the other way.\n(chuckling) But I was assuming they kind of, somebody paid somebody\nand not enough maybe. But in general, I just thought\nhe won sort of in the eyes of what martial arts stands for. Like, sort of go to the\nfire and survive and thrive. And finish the last round strong, which is kind of was like\nspiritually is what a victory is. So, I wish we kept going like. - [Craig] One more rounds.\n- Yeah, exactly. That kind of thing. Well, what about you? What do you think? Like, who are the fighters you admire? Like, who do you think is\nthe greatest of all time? - I think the fighter I\npaid most attention to was John Jones. You know, he has a great\nability just to mix the high level striking,\nhigh level grappling. Although his, you know, jiu-jitsu\nby itself isn't, you know, probably isn't like, you\nknow, super high level. But his ability to mix\neverything together, I would say he's the best. And he's a fellow, you know, heavier guy, heavyweight now. So, it's nice to see, you know, how those guys move at that weight. - And a fellow natural athlete? (soft laughter) See what I did there? All right. What about you, Nicky? - Yeah, if I had to pick a G.O.A.T. I would probably have to say Khabib, just because he was undefeated. And he had a very, you\nknow, high finishing rate. You know, very few of his fights actually went to a decision.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - So he just, overall, he dominated\nalmost every single opponent he went against. - The dominance."

So, much dominance has come. - I mean obviously, the amount of freestyle wrestling\nchampions from that region probably puts their wrestling\nabove and beyond the best in all of MMA. And obviously, even in the Olympics, a lot of champions outta there, right? So, I think that skillset\ncombines with them adding effective pin\ncontrols on the ground and jiu-jitsu submissions. But I mean, again, I think it's that hard training those guys like Khabib,\nwould maintain that pressure throughout the entire\nfight and break guys down. Their ability to fatigue\nguys to a breaking point, I think is something they do best. - I wonder what that is. What is that, technique? What is that? What is it about their upbringing? Cause it's just that part of the world. Or the Saitiev brothers with\nthe freestyle wrestling side to all the mixed martial arts people. Like, it must be part\nof the culture, also.

Aussies, British, Irish, Kiwis. I believe we have a way\nbetter level of banter and attacking each other. And it's almost too easy\nto pick on Americans to take themselves very seriously. I mean, arguably even, other\nparts of the world too. The far east of Europe, you know? - Well, that's the\ntricky thing with Conor.

But I felt like early on\nhe had the right balance, where he wouldn't really\ncross a line but he would do, he would do enough. He just took it to another level, Obviously, later in his career.

He's probably by far the\nmost popular combat athlete of all time because of that. - [Craig] Yeah. - I feel like you have to cross the line. I don't think enough people\nappreciate like the values he's brought by crossing the line. - He's making a sacrifice\ncrossing the line that's gonna affect him for\nthe rest of his life, you know? - I see. I don't think so. I think you can always walk back. Cause I think unlike-- People might disagree with this. I, well, yeah. I thought he always radiated\na respect for the opponent. Like, afterwards.

I think back one, core\nsecond, and then biceps. - Okay, biceps. Cool. Do you legitimately think like weightlifting helps jiu-jitsu? It's kind of the discussion\non the steroids is like, the muscle mass and strength and power, and explosiveness, all of that. - I think sometimes when we're at that upper echelon of\ncompetition, there's only, there's like little minute\nbattles that you have to win in. And if you're relatively\nclose in technique, then a lot of times, a\nstronger opponent pulls it out. - But it could be also\njust a limitation, right? You hold position too long. What about for hobbyists? Do you recommend weightlifting? Like, when you've seen people in the gym? - I always recommend weightlifting. I almost see muscle as\nthe body's armor, right? The more armor you have, the more damage you can kind of take. And, you know, maybe recovery\nis a little bit better. And I've always seen\nweightlifting as a means to stick to my routine. There's no point in lifting\nif you're not eating right and you're not sleeping right. So, if you kind of put it all together, then it's beneficial. - What about you guys? Do you go to the gym? - I go to the gym, yeah. - Do you go to like, the hotel gym, to using an elliptical\nand that butt machine or. - Yeah, I focus on the glutes heavily. - All right. (giggles) What about, like, what about\ninjury prevention and so on? How do you train to\nminimize the risk of injury? You guys have all been pretty beat up. You've gotten a major injury with the ACL. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah. - So, how do you train to minimize injury? - Probably not the right guy to ask, eh? (Nicky Ryan laughs)\n- Yeah. Definitely. - Actually, can you talk\nthrough your injury? Like what happened? - Yeah. So, about one week\nprior to this last ADCC, I was wrestling with this guy named Kenta, who was also competing. And I went to go lift him\nfrom like a rear body lock, and he hooked the outside of my leg, and we just felt something pop. You know, he felt a shift with his leg. And, when it first happened, it hurt for like the first 30 seconds. And then I honestly debated,\nI was like, maybe it was just, you know, some freak thing. I was like, I literally thought about\ncontinuing the session. Then the next day I woke up\nand it was like super sore. I was, you know, limping around, couldn't do a full squat. So, it pretty much\nkilled all of my training for the entire week\nleading up to the event. So, I couldn't train or\nanything, messed up the cut. Obviously, there's added\nnerves with that too. You know, when you're\nnot in the gym every day leading up to the competition. I went out there. I wasn't really able to pull\nguard cause I couldn't get, you know, full heel to butt connection. Which is inevitable with playing guard. And I was very hesitant to shoot as well. So, I came out with the idea of just trying to use hand fighting to tire my first opponent out. And then mainly look to get to underhooks or over hooks and do mostly\nupper body wrestling. In the beginning of\nthe match, I, you know, successfully got to an underhook. I got to a rear body lock, he tried to roll and I\nended up in top position and side control. But it was during the no points period. And then as the match went on, I gassed out and eventually,\nhe ended up taking me down and then scoring with\ntwo hooks on the back. - So, what's the injury? - Yeah, so I got an MRI\nactually, after the event. I didn't know--\n- So, you waited. Wait, wait. You waited until after the event? - Yeah, I waited until after. - Like acknowledge, or\nignorance is bliss? Is that-- - Yeah, exactly. I was like, I honestly, I don't even want to know what's wrong. I was like, I just go out there compete. You know, I knew it was\nlike the biggest event to date, and I really wanted to do it. - Did you think about not doing it? - It definitely was a thought in my head. Especially, the day after. You know? It's always the worst\nday whenever you have like a serious injury, is the day after. And I was like, man, I\nreally can't do a full squat. I was like, I don't even know how I'm gonna be able to do this. It got a bit better as the week went on. But I was like, man, I have\nto go out there and compete. I was like, it'll always\nbe in the back of my mind. Like what if? If I ended up pulling out. - What did you think about this whole? - I thought he was just being a pussy. - Yeah. (laughter) - Just slap him around. Just yell at him. Was that the-- - I didn't think we pressured you. We just saw you make\nyour own decision, right? - We're just like, yeah. - Is that tricky thing to do? Like with a heavily, like\na serious injury like this? - We don't know.\n- We didn't know that was the thing, we didn't know. Honestly, initially I thought it was, I had tore my lateral meniscus. But that ended up not being the case. It ended up being a full ACL tear. I was actually super surprised\nwhen I got the MRI results. So yeah, we didn't know\nhow bad it actually was. - What do you think about that situation? - I think Nicky's a tough kid. And I mean, when you're so\nclose to that competition, you know, there's not many, you don't get many opportunities\nlike that to compete in front of, you know, 15,000 people. It's like, you know, props to you for pushing\nthrough it and getting it. And man, he had a close match\nwith one of the best grapplers in his weight class and\nit's like, you know, a few adjustments here and there. And especially, you know, if he was able to train previously, leading up to that match,\nI think Nicky pulls it out. - So, some of the things\nyou mentioned is nerves. So, there's extra nerves just\nbecause you're under prepared. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah, I mean, you know, - Or feeling under prepared. - You wanna go into a\ncompetition with, you know, the confidence. I did everything that I could\nleading up to this event. I trained as much as I could. And then when an injury prevents that, you start to doubt yourself more. - How do you guys think about injury? How do you train, you know, training with the best in the world, training to be the best in the world, and avoiding injury. Cause you've gotten-- You tore your bicep?\n- Yeah. Yeah, I tore a bicep. - Doing curls or?\n- Ha ha. Dude, honestly, I was body building, you know, for like seven years. And no lie, I did, I trained biceps like most days. Like, almost every day\nin those seven years. Pretty much, I injured myself. - That's so jersey, man. That's great.\n- [Craig] Anything else? Or just the bicep? - Just, I mean, no.\n(laughs) Yeah, I injured the bicep pretty much the day before our wrestling\npractice I had like, a killer arm day and by arm\nday I just mean training biceps very rigorously getting a sick pump. And I go to wrestling\npractice the next day, you know, pretty late. I should have been there. I didn't get a proper warmup in. And the first thing I do is I shake hands and I go to shoot a single leg and boom, I just blew my arm out,\nthe first movement I did. So, just not being warmed\nup properly in addition to, you know, having a very vigorous\narm day, few hours prior. - You hear that about warmup. So like, what are some\nlessons about avoiding injury? - I would say number one\nis, warming up properly. Making sure your body's hot\nbefore you do hot stuff. - Okay. And what does warmup look like for you? Is it jiu-jitsu or non jiu-jitsu stuff? - Yeah, just for a warmup in general. I'll do something like a, if I'm talking competition,\nsomething like, a jog walk back and forth a few times, then a sprint jog a few\ntimes to get that heart rate, you know, up and down. - Yeah. - And then I'll grab a partner. I actually just filmed\nthe DVD or instructional, specifically on the pre-match ritual. In addition to that, I'll,\nyou know, grab a partner, I'll drill some movements. Typically, I'll drill some bad things. Like I'll start from bottom, bottom mouth, bottom side control, workout from there. And then pretty much like 20 minutes in, I'm hot and I'm ready to\ngo for, you know, rounds. - Well, what about you, Craig? So, what's the way to avoid injury? What's the worst injury you've had? - What's the worst injury? I don't even know. I'm pretty good, pretty healthy. Yeah. - Whenever you quit in practice, I'm like, it's a mental injury. - Has your heart ever been broken? - Oh, many times. Many times. But, there's a thing I notice, people that spend the\nmost time warming up, often the most injured. (soft chuckling) It's a strong correlation. - All right. You can't argue with science. - I remember training with Oliver Taza. Oliver Taza would have a 60 minute warmup. - [Lex] Yeah. - Surprise, surprise. Always injured.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Very common.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I find that very common\nin the training room. Now, I think people, it's how they train. Like, if you, Like me, first sign of discomfort, Ooh, back pedal. You know? Push through that stuff. Go too hard, go when you're too tired. You know what I mean? Get too emotional in the role. I feel like those are the\ntimes that I've been hurt, where I've just like, Ugh! I can't let this guy get me. When I have that attitude and tra-- I believe it's how you train\nand sort of obviously-- - So, what does this come from? Like positionally, too? Cause you're training\nagainst some killers. I mean, you're training with him and going probably pretty hard. - [Craig] once a month. - When Craig gets a little tired, he's like, \"Yeah, I'm good for today.\" - Once a month, with Nicky Rod, that's it. (Nicky Rod laughs) - And then you quit like 30 seconds in. - I mean, yeah, you know? You gotta be safe, you know?\n(Nicky Ryan giggling) - I like it. What about you? What have you learned from the ACL tear? - Do rehab, yeah.\n- Yeah. Rehab definitely would help. - [Lex] Oh, so you haven't been in like-- - I didn't get surgery. I didn't do essentially any rehab. I just have no ACL in my left leg. - So, what's it like having no-- - The surgeon goes, \"You've got two options,\nsurgery, rehab only.\" Nicky goes, \"I'll do nothing.\" (laughter)\n- Yeah. Definitely should pick up on the rehab. - What's rehab for that look like? Like twice a day doing some weird, - [Nicky Ryan] I don't know. (laughter) - You're clueless. - Like, bands or something. - It's good, he's learned from these. He's learned some valuable lessons about taking care of his body. - Yeah. - What's it like just\ntraining with no ACL? - So, at the beginning it\nwas definitely a little iffy. You know, I would have\nan occasional buckle, like I'd just be wrestling with somebody and go to step back and\nit'd buckle backwards a bit. But honestly now, like I haven't had a single\nbuckle instance in a while. It feels a hundred percent\nnormal when I train. It feels better than my\nother knee, to be honest. Like I've had,\n(chuckles) I had my meniscus taken\nout in my right leg. And that one gets sore more\noften than the no ACL leg. - Okay.\nAll right. So, putting that aside, is there wisdom you've\nlearned from that experience? - Yeah, definitely should\nbe doing rehab and prehab. You know, I think that, you know, especially if you're a hobbyist\nor a professional athlete, you should be lifting, you know, whether you're rehabbing an injury or just for injury prevention. - So, I'm actually closer to Craig, cause I've trained my whole\nlife like pretty hard. Obviously just the hobbyist,\nbut like, twice a day. Did judo, wrestling, all that, and never broke anything, never injured. Kind of like similar philosophy. Except, like last year, I guess, a year and a half ago. I got a tiny like groin pull injury, and it still hasn't healed. And I've been using your\napproach of not giving a shit. - Yeah. - And like, all right, surely this is gonna heal, it'll be fine. But, it hasn't. But, of course if I was\nlike an actual athlete, I would like probably\nstill train through it. Just fuck it, figure it out. But when you have other stuff going on, you just kind of wait it out. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah. - But no, I think probably rehab, especially as you get older, you have to do that kind of stuff. - I think it's important\nfor people to, you know, determine whether what\nthey're going through, is it injury or they're\njust hurt a little bit. Because injury, you\nknow, for sure take time, rehab it, and get better. But a lot of people like\nthey'll stub a toe or something like, oh, you're out for a few weeks. You know, so. - Well, that's the problem\nwith the injury I have. It feels like a stubbed toe. So, I was like, all right, I'll just wait a couple\ndays, it'll be fine. And then a couple days\nlater, it's not fine. And you wait and then I never got an MRI, never got any of that. It's like, I'm sure I'll be fine. Yeah. So, it's hard to know sometimes. Like, what? It's hard to know. I feel like a lot of people\nwill just not check it, oh, I'll be fine. Well, because there's\nseveral failure cases. There is a failure case of\nwhere everything is a stub toe. You're like, fuck it. Like you're bleeding everywhere,\nyou know that's fine. Whatever. So, you have to be careful a lot of people can fall into that too. I think I'm in that category. Go to the doctor. Why do you go to the doctor?\n- Yeah. - Your best approach is typically wait until something else gets hurt, so that you'll forget about the grind. - Yeah, exactly. That's what I was hoping, I was hoping to get hurt, waiting for the broken heart, maybe. Okay. That was very helpful."

      "section": "Pre-match ritual",
      "text": "Oh, you mentioned you're doing a whole thing on the pre-match ritual. Can you kind of preview like what kind of, what's involved in your pre-match ritual? - It's pretty big in the wrestling culture and the fighting culture,\nlike kind of what, what to do before your competition. But I think a few of our, a few people are just kind of missing out exactly what to do. So, I break it down for them. I break it down to people\nlike four weeks in advance, how you should prep, you know? Your trading and your nutrition, and your sleep for competition. In addition to that, I break it down even\nlike to a smaller scale with like, how early you\nshould get to the event, when you should be visualizing,\nyou know, your competition, what to do, like, you\nknow, 30 minutes before, 20 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes. And the kind of mentality\nyou should have throughout those times before you\nactually step onto the mat. - When are you visualizing? Like, how much are you visualizing? When you say competition, you're talking about the\ntournament or the actual people you might be competing against? - A little bit of both. I'll spend time just\nvisualizing the crowd. Like, if it's gonna be, you know, an arena with 15,000 people, I'll spend time in practice and whatnot, like putting myself inside\nthat arena and visualizing, you know, stepping on the mat, and hearing the crowd scream and whatnot. That way, you know,\nwhen competition comes, the time comes, it's\nkind of the same deal. I'm accustomed to it. In addition, when I get to the arena, I'll step on the mat, I'll\nkind of look at everything, I'll expose my senses\nto what it's gonna be. And then I'll kind of shut\neverything off like a lot. Some people, you know, scroll through their phone\nand can treat it like normal, have this normal conversations. For me, I like to limit my sensory intake before I go out and compete. I just feel like sometimes we only have so many decisions\nyou can make in a day. And I want all of my\nbest decisions to be made when it matters, when it counts. - Uh, what about you? Do you limit your sensory input? - On game day? Honestly, no routine, nothing. I don't, yeah, I don't do anything. - [Nicky Rod] This guy's a double silver. - We're both double. (laughter) - You should get it. You should buy his instructional. It might help you. I'll get another silver. (laughter) No, honestly, nothing. Hey, I just try to relax, treat it like it's before training. - Try to visualizations or no. - No, no visualization. - So, the opposite of\nvisualization, you just avoid it? - [Craig] Yeah. - Before thinking about it. - Yeah, I don't even think about it. I'm just like, yeah, we'll have a good time, you know? Try to appreciate it, that I can do it. - By the way, when you visualize, are you visualizing tough positions or you visualize winning, mostly? - Definitely visualize winning. I'll visualize how I'm gonna get to my most dominant positions. Cause you know, in comp, I wanna do what I'm best at. And also see, I see my opponent in his best positions and how I'm gonna escape\nthose if necessary. But most of the time I'm just visualizing exactly what I'm gonna do in that match. And I go out there and do it. - Okay. So, when your teammate Craig is, you know, another like world class athlete has a fundamentally different\nphilosophy than you, do you visualize being frustrated at him? - No, not frustrated, but I'll definitely come into\npractice with like solutions to problems that Craig gives me. You know, like if Craig's, you know, catching me a sub\nor giving me issues like, you know, I'll go home, I'll watch him a match\nthat he lost for motivation and I'll come back and I'll put it on him. (laughter) - Just DM him like a\nhighlight reel of him losing. - Yep. (soft chuckling) What about you? Like, does it affect you that\nyou're a bit of an outlier? - Usually before I compete, or right before I go out there,\nI go, why am I doing this? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Do I still need to do this? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And I think, fuck, hopefully I don't embarrass myself affect my instructional sales. That's the last thought. But, I didn't even put too much thought into the whole competing thing. I'm just like, you know what? Train hard, hopefully have\na good time out there. - What about the motivation aspect? Like, that voice that says\nlike, why am I doing this? That voice can break a lot of people. Like, in the weight cut, it\ncan break a lot of people. Like, why am I doing this stupid,\nsilly sport like you said. A bunch of dudes just rolling\naround like, what's the point? - I'll come up to someone\nwith a 9 to 5 job, and I'll be like, yeah,\nthat's why I'm doing this. You know? Avoid that. (giggles) - [Lex] Sure. - [Nicky Rod] With all those DVDs, man. - Yeah, I didn't get\ntoo deep on competing. - [Lex] Yeah. - We're so polar opposite. (Craig cackles) It's like almost uncomfortable\nto be around you. - Obviously, one of us is a clean athlete. (laughter) - You should do a DVD on that. What about you in terms of\npreparing for competition, Nicky? The day before, the day of, are there rituals that you follow? - Honestly, like the few\ndays leading up to it, it's different for me every time. Like, sometimes I'll\nwarm up before I compete, sometimes I won't. Sometimes I'll fast, sometimes I'll eat. So I literally, it's\njust completely random. I don't follow any specific thing. But in the training room\nleading up to the competition, I'll definitely, you know, like Nicky Rod, visualize\nthat I'm walking out onto the competition mats. You know, I'll pick somebody that's, you know, a similar body type to the person that I'm competing against. And then, you know, we'll start out with some distance between us. We'll come out, smack hands, and you know, act like everything's a real competition. I'll even sometimes have, you know, corners that will yell out\ntimes and things like that just to replicate it as much as possible. - That's funny, because\nI've talked to a lot of Olympic gold medalists. I used to do a podcast\nwith like, athletes. And they all sound like Nicky Rod. The two of you are outliers. I don't know, sometimes\nI'll do this, sometimes. So anyway, but that's also\njiu-jitsu culture, I think. Maybe the chaos of not\ntaking things too serious is actually really, really helpful. Sometimes the pressure of\ntaking everything way too seriously can break you. - I mean, I just don't think\nit's that big a sport really. You know? Like-- - I think if I compete\nevery day in practice, it'd just make competition much easier. So, I just put the pressure on there. - On the competition, yeah, yeah. On the, sorry, on the training, on the competing in the training. I don't know. Olympic sports aren't that\nbig either, financially. And people take it extremely,\nextremely seriously. Like, you don't really even\nget that much money from judo. - I mean, I just don't take\njiu-jitsu that seriously cause like, I was just partying,\nhaving a good time until 21 and then I was like, oh fuck. Do I get a job, or do I\npursue professional sports? And I feel like if I can made a career in jiu-jitsu\nwith a decision at that point. - And now you just\nstumbled your way somehow, into like being at the top of the would. - Yeah, that's what I feel like. I just walked into it. I feel like I couldn't just\ndo that in wrestling, boxing. I couldn't do that in other sports."

      "text": "- What was the toughest\nmatch you've ever had that pushed you mentally,\nphysically, technically? This doesn't have to be\nthe best person you faced. But was there like a moment\nin your career that was like, really defining for you? - I mean, I would say like\nthe toughest mentally, was just this last ADCC, you know? I just had a big injury leading\ninto it that kind of screwed the whole camp and weight\ncutting everything up. So yeah, I would say the last ADCC. - Are you proud of your performance there? Like, you stepped on the mat that you pushed through all of it? - Like I said, I'm a very competitive\nperson and I hate losing. So, definitely not, yeah. - You had a collapsed lung. (Nicky Ryan giggles)\n- Yeah. (Nicky Rod laughs hysterically) - [Nicky Ryan] Actually, - K, can we elaborate on this? - [Nicky Rod] Oh, man. Dude.\n(laughs) - He was so physically\nexhausted afterwards, couldn't breathe. We had to get medical intervention. He thought he had a collapsed lung. (giggles)\n- No, no. I was the most tired that\nI've ever been in my life in that match. I actually popped a\nblood vessel in my eye. I was trying so hard. - He comes out, he walks off of the ADCC\nmat backstage and I'm like, I'm kind of getting\nwarmed up for my match. And Nicky run comes, he walks over huffing and puffing. And his mom's right next to me. He looks at her, he is like, \"I think I need help. I think I got a lung collapse.\" - That's not true. (laughter) - [Nicky Rod] No? That's not true? - My mom's the one that\ncalled for medical help. - Oh, okay, okay. - I was just laying on\nthe warmup, fucking dying. (laughter) - Well, we're happy you're fine. (chuckles)\n- Yeah. - Two working long. - Laid it all on the line. What about you, Craig? - Defining or toughest matches? - [Lex] Mhm. - I mean, they're all\npretty tough, you know? I don't know. I can't really pinpoint one. I mean probably the most annoying\none was obviously the one where I had Gordon Armbar. I was like, tap bro. And he wouldn't tap, so I let him out. (Nicky Ryan laughs) Mentally, I was like, I\nshouldn't have done that. - Do you ever have a thing\nin your brain where it says, should I should shit talk now or not? And you ever, you say, no, I'm gonna be respectful. - I just can't be serious\n- [Lex] Yeah. - About some of these things, you know? I don't know, it's just silly. It seems silly.\n- Yeah. All of it. The whole thing. What about you, Nicky Rod? - Dude, honestly, most\nof my toughest matches are in the training room, right? Because I started with these guys, I started training under\nthem like, you know, started training at DDS when\nI didn't have any knowledge. Like, I knew wrestling, I knew like a knee cut in jiu-jitsu. But like, I started training\nwith them when I knew almost no jiu-jitsu. And then I had to like, you know, really work my way up. So definitely, in the\ntraining room, like being, like having one of these\nguys on my back or like, there's a stretch of like a\nfew weeks or months when Covid first hit and there was just like, four of the best grapplers in the world. And we just did drilling and live rounds with these four guys and\nit was just, it was hard. It was very hard, you know, every round we're doing six rounds, seven days a week with the\nbest grapplers in the world. And it's like, you get no break, and you're forced to learn on the go. So, I think, for me in the training room, that was definitely my toughest matches. And that's where I built, you\nknow, those mental callouses. - That was a period where I\ndrew with Nicky Rod probably, what, nine months? 12 months?\n- [Nicky Rod] Yeah. - And typically speaking, like I said, no warmups the first round, we\nusually take it pretty easy. First round you start in mount. The whole room, the rest\nof the training room, they take mount very lightly. Me and Nicky Rod would be\nfighting to the death every day. I felt like we did an\nextra round every day. It was very grueling-- - I'm very mean when I'm in\nthe midst of drilling or live. Like, we would do, we would drill wrestling, you know, quite a bit, like stand up. And in the drilling, like, I just wouldn't\nlet Craig take me down. Like we're not gonna\nlie, we're just drilling, but I just wouldn't let\nhim put me on the floor. So, things like that, you know? (laughter) - I know it escalate."

      "section": "Positional training",
      "text": "- Yeah. - So, you mentioned mount, like, so you do positional training? So is that, would that be the hardest\nversus like live training open like, starting from guard? - I would say mount and turtle definitely, definitely made me very tough. Cause you spent all this effort\ngetting off of bottom mount, and then you gotta get on top of a guy. At the time I'm not that\ngood at holding guys down, so they escape quick and I'm like, fuck, I just tried to hold him down. Gotta go back down. Same thing with a turtle. It's like, you start bottom turtle, you're trying to explode,\nget out and get away. And then you know, you switch and this guy\ngets up pretty quick and you're like, damn, I\ngotta go right back down. It's that constant circle man. It's very tough. But definitely, you know, built\nsome character on the mat. - What do you think is the\nvalue of positional training in general in jiu-jitsu? Actually, this one just\ninteracting with you guys. It's not commonly done in just\nlike regular jiu-jitsu gyms. What do you see? Because probably it's not\ncommonly done cause it's so-- Most of the experience\nis just frustrating. Like, if you're evenly matched, you're basically\nfrustrated the whole time. If you're doing it right. - There's a psychological\nbattle that happens in like the mountain turnarounds. It's like, you know, cause maybe you get\nclose to subbing a guy, or maybe you do sub him, you know, when you start on\nturtle and you're on their back, you finish 'em and then you\nget this high point and then immediately you gotta go back\ndown to defensive posture. - Yeah. - And it's very like, it's emotionally like up and down. So, it's hard to deal with. - Super important if you are one of the better people in the gym. Cause it just puts you in positions you don't find yourself\nin, in regular training. So, I think like a lot of, if you're a big fish in a small pond, you don't do positional sparring, you're probably gonna get\nexposed in competition. You might even look\nsilly in those positions. So, you really have to\nforce yourself to do it despite the fact that you've\ngiven someone worse than you a position where they might catch you. So, you have to sort of put the ego aside. - Yeah, that's one one of the things when I was training regularly, of course training with you\nguys, it's like trivial. But, I didn't work on putting\nmyself in bad positions. When you get better and you regret it. Cause, the big negative thing\nit has consequence it has on competition is you don't\ntake as many risks, cause you're kind of afraid\nfor your back to get taken. All that kind of stuff. - That was me before I went to DDS. I remember I showed up\nthere in that old position, I was like, fuck this.\n(laughter) You better earn this position, you know? - [Lex] Yeah, exactly. - I didn't really have escapes. That was a learning\ncurve for me, for sure. - Do you see the value\nin positional training? Or is it just the source\nof tremendous frustration? - Yeah, I definitely think\nit plays a big part in, you know, your confidence\nwhen you step out onto the competition mats, you know? Being confident that even\nif you get put in the worst possible situations, you know what to do and\nknow how to work out of 'em. - So, I had a long\nargument with Roger Gracie, when you visited and he thinks mount is the most dominant position. Even No-Gi versus Beck. Is there a case to be made for that or no? - I think all of your opponents utensils, their tools are in front of them. So, like if you're on mount,\nthey still have, you know, there's a few ways to get out mount. I think if you're on somebody's back, I'd personally much rather\nbe on somebody's back than, - Flattened out. I'd rather have someone's\nback than flattened out. - Boots in, flattened out. Yeah. - Boots in, flattened out. So, not even body triangle,\nbut just flattened. - Just completely flat. Almost like they're position\nMMA where you see guys get finished cause they can't get out. I think that position is probably the hardest\nposition to escape. - Can you see what Hodge's\ntalking about with mount? Or is he just that good\nat mount that he says? - He might mean the Gi,\ncross collar, you know? I don't know. Or did he mean--\n- Well, he says controlling-wise. He just believes that you can complete-- That there's, he actually thinks there's\nmore ways to get out from the back than\nthere is from the mount. - Prior to--\n- Getting up, including like, physically. - Prior to the keeping escape, I would probably agree with him. But that keeping escape's\nso difficult to manage. It's the funny looking escape. We--\n- [Lex] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Craig] Legs are wiggling. People have a lot of trouble. It's like super hard to learn how to do. But then once you learn how to do it, the effectiveness is just huge. - [Lex] Yeah, it's a weird one. When did that come to be a thing? Is that pretty recent? - [Craig] I mean, I saw DDS\nguys using it first, I think. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah. - Who was the first guy to\ndiscover something like that? This seems like a ridiculous\nthing to discover. - Yeah, like what if I just wiggle? (laughter) - I thought it was a joke at first. I was like, you guys really doing this? He's like, \"Yeah.\" All right. (laughter) I remember somebody\nshowing me like a technique where like, if you just\nlike walk your hand on a mat or something like that. - Maybe an arm triangle\nor something like that? - Yeah, yeah. - Trying to walk the arm behind the arm. - It's just like a funny discovery like, as opposed to like\ntrying to like shove it in, just like, walk it. - I like doing that to people, but with things that aren't true. (Lex laughs)\n- You know what I mean? I'll just tell 'em this is\na technique and watch 'em try to work out if I'm\nbeing serious or not. - Yeah, that's what you do\nwhen you achieve guru status. They'll just listen to you\nlike you're Steven Seagal. - See what they'll believe. - Speaking of which, how do you balance, you have to travel all across the world. How do you balance that\nwith running a school or being a world class jiu-jitsu athlete? - Oh, me. I mean, the secrets of\ntravel for me are two drugs, Xanax and Modafinil. That's how we time adjust and\nwe hit the ground running. - What does Modafinil do? Xanax puts you sleep. - I mean, I have narcolepsy. So, it's a narcolepsy medication. (laughter) - How does that work with the steroids? - [Craig] How does it work? I mean, they work well together, you know? - Yeah.\nNice. - Focused and physical recovery. But in terms of traveling and\ntraining and stuff, it is, I mean we're lucky cause we've\ngot so many high level guys. So like, we can travel and\nthey're still in good hands. I mean, it would be a\nproblem if me, Nicky Rod, and Nicky Ryan left and the gym had Ethan. That would be a problem.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - But, we gotta make sure\nit's not just him there. - Although everyone says\nthey're happy when you're gone. So, that's the rumor I heard. - Happy when I'm gone,\nbut they do miss me. - [Lex] Yeah. - For sure, until I get back. - All right. What about you? Just like balancing it, do you try to stay completely\nfocused on competing, like for some of the big\nmatches you have coming up? Or are you able to kind of diversify? - Well, I like to, yeah,\ndiversify my training to where, you know, if I don't have\na competition scheduled, I'm more focused on skill\ndevelopment and you know, getting better and\nbroadening my tool shed. But you know, if I'm like\nsix weeks before comp, I really start amping up the intensity that I bring into the mats\nagainst bringing some of that visualization towards practice. And maybe I train less\nvolume pre-competition, but higher output per session."

I usually, Definitely usually, train\nboth of those sessions, depending on how my body feels. - You're doing positional,\ndoing every like technique, positional, live. - I should probably do more positional because I'm just trying to\nwork on wrestling and stuff. And especially leading up\nto Volkanovski's last fight, I was trying to wrestle more\nand focus on those areas even before I traveled over there. Just some experimentation\nwith some stuff, but yeah. - How do you experiment with stuff? Like how do you, So, there's like regular positional stuff, but when you have ideas, like, where? Do you do it in during\nthe training sessions, or do it outside of that? Do you get together with somebody? - Usually, every session I show up with something I'm thinking of. Usually something from top,\nmaybe something from bottom. And then I just try to\nmaybe pick the right people. Some people obviously I'm just\nfighting to the death with. It's not a good time to experiment. And then others obviously you can, you can play around with ideas on. - Okay. What about you? What's a perfect week look like? Maybe. Well, you said you're\na hundred percent now. - Yeah. See, yeah, honestly I have pretty much\nthe same schedule as Nicky Rod. So, Monday, Wednesday,\nFriday, I do twice a day. Every other day, once a day. And then normally, noon practice\nis like our biggest class. That's where, you know,\nall the pros go in. So, I tend to do more open rounds there. And then we have a 7:00 PM class as well, which is more hobbyists. And that's where I'll do my\npositional rounds and you know, force myself to be put in bad positions. - So, you have what you do? 8:00 AM, 12, like in\nterms of what B-Team has. 8:00 AM, 12, and 7:00 PM. And the hobbyists are more 7:00 PM. - Yes. - Okay."

Do you think you can overtrain? - I used to not believe in it.\n(laughter) But, then I got hurt.\n(laughs) I was like, all right. - Oh, you attribute that to over training? The biceps. - I think, dude, I'm\ntelling you I trained, I lifted like a bodybuilder\nfor like seven years. And by lifting, I mean, I was\nlifting seven days a week. And I trained arms most days. Like, almost every day I\nwould do like, you know, four or five sets and get\na pretty good bicep pump, in addition to my lift. I think that had to contribute\nsomewhat towards my trade. - Fair enough. Well, what about on the\nactual mat over training? Like explaining too\nmuch time with the mat? - Well, I-- - Like, psychological,\nphysical over training. - I think you can definitely\novertrain but it's more of a, like, as your body's healthy, you have to make sure your mind is sharp. Like sometimes, maybe\ntaking a day away or even diverting your attention in a\ndifferent aspect of training can help you be a little\nbit sharper overall. Sometimes it can be like, it can get a little like stagnant, cause you're doing the\nsame stuff over and over. But I think if you just keep like, you know, over-training,\nthen your overall baseline just gets higher and you become, you know, accustomed to that. - What about you? You don't seem like a guy that over. - I've heard of it. Never been close to it. Nah, I think controlling\nhow hard you train is definitely protects you from injury, you know what I mean? Like, if you are redlining yourself and then you're fighting\nto the death in the gym, that's a hundred percent when\nyou're gonna get injured, gonna get sick. So, I try to make sure\nI've had enough sleep, I've had obviously enough\nfood post-training. And that sort of helps me\nto train a bit harder, but, (chuckles) still try to avoid\nredlining myself too much. - I think I established also like, what days are gonna be your peak days. Because throughout the week, if you're training seven days a week, you're gonna have ups and downs. Like for me personally,\nWednesday, Thursday, Friday usually my best days. And besides that, I also\nhave other great days. - Oh, my days are great. But Monday, Wednesday,\nFriday are also great. You're like, I'm able to admit that some\ndays are awful than others. I love that. I'm always on, bro. Okay."

      "text": "What advice would you give to people who are not always on hobbyists? How to get better. Like, people that are already there. I don't know. Purple belts, brown belts, black belts, they're just like doing\nlike a couple times a week or something like that. Like, how do you get better? - I think being consistent, like find a schedule that\nyou can consistently train. Maybe it's like, you know,\nthree, four times a week. Or even a little bit less. Just be consistent over the years. I think too often people are like, \"Oh, I wanna get really good really fast.\" And it's like, definitely takes a long time\nto get to where you wanna be. What about the, what you're doing during,\nlike while being consistent, what kind of stuff you're working on? - So honestly, I think one\nbig thing for me, which I, something I actually started\ndoing once B-Team was formed was filming all of your rounds and then watching it every day. Cause then you can see what\nspecific problems you're having and then you can base\nyour positional rounds around those problems. - That's really interesting. It's kind of depressing though. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah. - Like sometimes I have to, you know, I edited this podcast for a long time. I still do in part and I\nhate the sound of my voice, and like what I look like. It's tough. But it does make you better. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah. - And I also hate the\nsound of Craig's voice, and what he looks like.\n(laughter) So, editing this podcast\nwill be especially difficult. This would be doubly difficult. But I'm glad the rest of you are here. I don't know. That's a real thing. Do you watch competition\nfootage of yourself or no? Like to analyze, like to see. - It's my confidence. That's fucking good. - While you're doing curls. - Yeah. - I try not, and still watch\nhim to boost my confidence. - Is there advice you Craig, you would give for\nhobbyists to get better? - I mean, just... Not every round has to be a\nfight to the death, you know? - [Lex] True. - I feel like you're gonna get injured, burnt out that way and you're\nnot gonna learn as much. - [Lex] It's tough. I would say, just as a black belt who took jiu-jitsu very\nseriously for a very long time. Basically, when you become a hobbyist, your skill is basically slipping. Your age and your skill. And so, not taking stuff seriously is actually its own psychological\nskill of like you're... That, it's tough. It's tough. Like, it's tough in a way that is different when you're like\na blue belt or something. That if you work hard\nand you train correctly, you're gonna get much better. Here, you're kinda-- - You're looking downhill. - You're looking downhill, and you're like, \"Yeah, I guess I'm gonna\nenjoy the art of it.\" - Reframe the victory. You know? Like, if it's a young upcoming\nguy and he constant meet you, you're like whoa, that's\na moral victory, you know? - Yeah. But then that has to happen. You have to be able to not do that to avoid the injury, sometimes. Like if you want, So yeah, it's a different,\nit's a different thing. Plus with me, just because some\npeople recognize me, they... - They're coming. - You have that probably. You guys definitely obviously have that. - I've solved that problem. - How did you solve that problem? - Travel around. You do a seminar or anything like that? - [Lex] Yeah. - It's believable that you\ncould get submitted once. - [Lex] Yeah. - But if they catch you give 'em a few. - [Lex] Yeah. - If people tell their friends\nthey submitted me to seminar. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- One time, believable.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - They got me four or five times. - [Lex] Four times, yeah. - You've robbed them of that. - Okay. That's pretty funny. But it's also, they have\nthis energy like they think, you know, they're coming in hot. And I usually like to just\nbasically get submitted quickly twice and just, it changes everything. It makes it more fun. I see. I've noticed it. - Let them submit you twice?\n- Yeah. Just like very quickly. What are the options? (laughter) - [Nicky Rod] We're not, we're not saying they can\nlast longer, hold off. - But then it's like,\nit's very hard to like, Yeah. If you're a very serious\ncompetitor and so on, you take it seriously then, yes. But like then people go-- People, what they try to do. This is probably is what\nhappens to you guys. They try to impress you\nby going super hard. - I have people every day come to my gym, try to take me out.\n- Yeah? - You gotta, I just stay sharp. Come to practice, let's get it on. - Do you feel that energy? I feel like I need to talk\nto Craig here for a second. (laughter) Like, at a seminar, like somebody is coming\nin like really hard. Like, a brown belt will come in. And they really want to\nimpress you with like, their technical side. They're a big fan. They've been watching your DVDs. Like, what do you do with a guy like that? - I make a complete joke out of the roll. You know, give him the\npass, mess with him, do stupid shit, you know? Like, rob them of the realness of it, because it's stupid. I'm not gonna roll hard\nwith strangers, you know? I feel like you should roll with a circle of people you trust. Injuries happen rolling\nhard with strangers cause that's the same way you\nget injured in competition. Cause you don't have that\nrelationship with 'em. - And I should also mention, that's probably not a good\nway to impress somebody, by just going ape shit,\ngoing a hundred percent. - Oh yeah, not at all. - I think the beauty of just\nis like the camaraderie of it. Like, as you get to know\neach other's like technical, like different ideas you\nhave and all of that. Yeah. Okay. Do you think Gi jiu-jitsu is\ndying in popularity, Craig? - Yeah, it's long dead. I think it's just, I\nmean it just shows like, I mean, I have heard some\nnumbers on the viewership for the Gi World's finals\nand they don't even compare to the undercard of like,\nwho's number one events. So, I think like when I\nwas coming up and competing in the Gi all the time, you looked at those guys that\nwon black belt championships, and you were like in awe of them. It almost had that ADCC champion feel. But now, that's not the case. You know, I just feel like\nthat the younger generation aren't looking at who's\nwinning black belt Gi Worlds. I personally don't think, and I don't think they're\nlike, they wanna be that guy. They wanna be like a Ruotolo, Gordon. You know, those are the\npeople they wanna emulate. - So, you think like the Gi,\nlike IBJJF Gi tournaments will just keep declining in popularity? - Oh, I think people will still do it. I mean, it's easier I\nthink as you over 30, cause the Gi's a bit of a slower thing and the master's participation\nis bigger in the Gi. Cause obviously in No-Gi is now heading in a wrestling direction. Wrestling and heel hooks, you're over 30. That's a terrifying prospect, you know? What's terrifying about the Gi? Less, so I think in a participation rate, the IBJJF will still be good. But I just don't think\npeople are as interested as they used to be. - Well, why is wrestling\nin heel hooks terrifying? Like heel hooks, I can vaguely understand, if you don't understand heel hooks. - If you work a desk job\nand you've never wrestled and a guy double legs you, that's gonna probably break you back. You know? I think the older guys\nare scared of wrestling. - [Lex] Huh. - It's hard to wrestle at 40. - [Lex] To learn wrestling at 40. - Is it? Yeah, it's hard, yeah. I mean, I think it's\neven just hard in general to do wrestling at 40. But it's easy to pull half\nguard in the Gi at 40. - I think it's harder to do judo at 40, and people still do it at 40. Judo hurts more. - Judo's scarier than all of them. - Yeah. I think, does wrestling really hurt at 40? I don't know why I'm looking at you. - I don't know. I got a couple of years. - It does? Interesting. I mean--\n- I feel, I agree with you saying that Judo looks like the most dangerous. Like, even they're practice partners, they're just getting slammed flat. Bueno. - Yeah, I did. I mean, I did judo for a really long time. There's a lot of people\nthat are 40, 50, 60 do judo, and they get. - They're the ones that\nare still alive though. (Lex chuckles) - It's true. Survivor bias. You do a little bit of judo, right? - [Craig] Me? I'm a yellow belt. - You're a yellow belt in Judo? I should be your instructor. (soft laughter) Promote you to orange. - I got a yellow belt in the sixth grade. I believe it was the sixth grade. I did it for about, I don't know, sixth months. - But you're also using judo\nin competition, basically. Aren't you doing like Harai\ntype throw like you're doing? - Yeah, I don't know where I learned that. I just started doing it. - You just started lifting\nyour leg in various ways until it works.\n- Just figured it out. Yeah.\n- [Lex] Okay. Doing different kinds of tricks. - I looked at the Sambo guys doing it, I was like, \"It can't be that hard.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Gave it a crack. - Well, they looked at your foot locks and they said that can't be that hard. - They said it can't be that hard, ban it from the tournaments. (laughter) - All right."

      "text": "What do you think is the best\ntake down in No-Gi jiu-jitsu? Like what? Like, if people were trying\nto train for a competition and so on like, where do\nyou see the trends heading? - I think those foot sweep is\nlike catching fire nowadays. Seen a lot of foot sweeps. Foot sweeps and arm drags. I would say pretty, pretty\npopular in our sport. - Arm drag. It's just go arm drag to Okay. - Arm drag either to get 'em, like, get to behind them or\neven just to cause reactions, make them pull away and\nwe can start reattacking. - Are you talking about it in a context of what's the best takedown to score? What's the safest takedown\nto mitigate the risk of guillotine submission? Or most effective in general? - Yeah, most effective combined. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, hopefully it's about scoring. - I think any sort of body\nlock, you know what I mean? Locking your hands around the body. You've been able to put\n'em to the floor that way. I feel like that's most effective, safest, might even have arisen\nout of a leg attack, leg entry, upgrade to the body. - What about like foot sweeps? Like outside foot sweeps? What do we-- - I would say yeah, you know? Foot sweeps from outside\nfoot sweeps or even like, something like you're\ntossing and pulling by and you're sweeping the foot. - Yeah, those are all pretty safe. See, why is that scary? I don't understand. It's not scary at all. - I think it's the lift that is scary. - [Nicky Rod] The lifts, yeah. - Who's lifting people. - Your buddy--\n- Not like a good lift. - No, not you. I mean, in master like, we're talking about\nolder guys doing No-Gi. - Some of those old bosses\ntake it very serious, you know? - [Lex] They should start lifting. - TRT Worlds. - TRT Worlds.\n(laughs) - They're coming. They're coming to impress.\n- Grab a lift. All right. Just for the gram. Okay. What about submission? What's your favorite submission? And what do you think is the\nmost effective submission? Except the buggy choke? - I would have to say the rear naked. It's definitely the one\nthat's hit the most, and the highest level of competition. - Was that uh-- That was pretty interesting\nto see you escape all that and to put put it on. That's the cool thing about EBI, to see like the world class athletes. I was surprised that\nit's possible to escape with you on his back. - Gotta try some B-cream. - Oh yeah, B-cream. And has it helps? What's in the B-- What's the formula or is that a secret? - That is a proprietary blend for sure. - Okay. But that's what you use for greasing. That's what you greased before. - [Craig] Allegedly. - Allegedly. Is there other application\noutside of grappling? - I'm sure you can get creative. - [Lex] All right. Thanks. Asking for a friend. Is that the R&C for you as well? Rear naked choke?\n- Rear naked choke, I mean overall favorite for\nlike solidifying a finish. Cause like, you could put\nsomebody to sleep, right? Even if they don't want\nattack, put 'em to sleep. But, as far as like something\nI've been working on now that I'm now starting to\nimplement in competition, Yoko Sankaku's side triangles. Like, it's a beautiful thing. You have multiple options. You have the triangle to finish. If that fails, you have the\nKimura, you could break the arm. You could also just\ntransfer and take the back. So, Yoko Sankaku, I'm a big fan of, and I continue to progress\nand be better at it. - Have you ever broken anyone's arm? - Oh yeah. I mean the first few competitions cause I was like, you know, pretty athletic grappler\nor athletic wrestler going against local black\nbelts and brown belts. Like, one of my first matches\nI broke somebody a Kimura. Pretty much every time\nI've got a heel hook, which is only twice\nI've broken an opponent. If I have a joint lock,\nit's probably gonna break. Like a lot of times it\nbreaks before they tap. (Lex chuckles)\nYeah. - You seem like a really friendly fella. How hard is it to break an\narm or any break a joint? - Well, I don't think it's that hard. I think, like if you're\ntalking about an arm bar, we have this position to where like people are kind of holding on,\nholding on, and then it slips and their arm starts going. - Sure. - And then it just\nbreaks before they even, you know, get a chance to tap. - I love this sport. - I knee barred a guy and\nhe didn't tap one time. And it was actually, it was surprising. I had to put a lot of force into that. As opposed to arms, shoulders, and the ligaments in the knees and ankles. But to fully, this kid, Sambo a kid,\n- Mhm. - fully let it go and he tapped it. I think the angle is like up here. - Cause they're built different. (hesitant laughter) - Hopefully, he can be reconstructed. - He's rebuilt different. - Yeah.\n(chuckling) - All right. What about a straight foot lock? You've ever, do you guys do straight\nfoot locks at all or no? - Yeah, I mean I'm learning them now. We had some kid come into\npractice one day and like fucking pull out all of us do it. - Pull a straight foot lock? - Straight foot lock. Just this little like Polish kid. - Not only did he foot lock everyone, but he told the entire world. (laughter) He's sending out fucking emails. (laughter) Calling his friends and family. - We practically put a hit\nout on him in practice. And you just sold everybody.\n(laughs) - Yeah, it's always\ninteresting when you get like, people that specialize can surprise you that this could be effective stuff. Do you think there's other\nstuff that could be still discovered in jiu-jitsu? Like, what areas do\nyou think are ripe with techniques to discover? Like wrestling is really interesting now. There's a lot of innovation\nhappening in wrestling. - I think there'll be more innovation when we get people that\nare more adamant about standing up from bottom position. I think when if we get more of\nthe community, they're like, all right, I want to get off the bottom. I think--\n- \"Just Stand Up.\" - \"Just Stand Up.\" - How'd you just, it doesn't work. - We actually changed the name. How Sambo doesn't work,\nif you just stand up. - [Lex] Did you really?\n- Yeah. - [Lex] All right.\n(Craig laughs hysterically) I'll change it to jiu-jitsu\nwhen I hired it and sent it for free to the entirety of the Soviet block."

      "text": "Hey, Nicky Rod, do you think ego is\nuseful for martial arts, or does it get in the way? - Okay, I think you need\nto use it in both ways. For sure, have an ego, like if you're training competition mode. But also it can prevent you\nfrom learning and progressing if your ego's too high. Like you really have to shut the ego down when you're in the mode\nof learning and trying to, you know, develop skills. Cause you're gonna put yourself\nin these bad positions. You're gonna have issues\nwith training partners that aren't necessarily, you\nknow, up to your skill level. But because you're in these bad positions, you have to make these certain sacrifices. And for sure, ego can\nbe a good or bad thing. But if you're able to shut\nthe ego off and learn, then that'll have huge\nprogression when it's time to put the ego on into\nuse during competition. - When's the last time\nyou shut the ego off? - It's been a long time. (soft laughter) (Lex laughing) - What about you, Craig? Do you, I mean, you seem\nto be super easygoing. Is there, like, is the\nego just not part of it? - Oh, for sure. I just don't want anyone to\nknow they've damaged my ego. You know? You have to suppress it deep down. - There's a child underneath\nall of it crying, always. - For sure. I think ego's good for a bit\nof perseverance, you know? Like, it'll help you stick it out against a tough battle with a\ntraining partner for sure. A bit of ego's on the line. Plus the banter back and forth. We're trying to like,\nstir each other up a bit. - [Lex] Talk with the shit, yeah. - I think that helps hone,\nsharpen the ego a bit. - What about you? You, did you try? You seem like a super humble guy? Is there like a monster underneath? - Oh, it's a total act. - [Lex] It's an act. Who's in the basement? - I think ego's a big motivator. You know, I think it's very good to have in the aspect that it, like, it'll drive you to help to want to be one of the best in the world. But like Nicky Rod said, you need to be able to turn\nit off in the training room, and, you know, force\nyourself into bad positions where you may not be winning. - Are there, like, you know,\nDanaher's mentioned Boris. Are there like grapplers, like Boris, this is a question from Reddit actually. Boris-like characters, anybody you've trained with in\nthe past who doesn't compete, but is just an absolute beast in training? Like, people you've\nmet that are just like. - Well, somebody that\nI think has a probably the best like submission grappling in MMA, I think like Gilbert Burns is a-- His submission grappling, that's something that's very, very good. I trained with him early\non in my grappling career, and I was really impressed\nby his ability to move, hold down opponents that\nare trying to stand up, and as a whole, you know,\nhe can get submissions and put people away. - When's the last time? Have you trained with him recently or no? - No, it's been a few years. - Which is impressive ability\nto submit, you're saying? - Yeah. Like, I mean, you know, I'd see Gilbert go against a few, like, pretty decent black belts in\nthe room, and fair well and, you know, maybe he gets to their back, puts a choke and it's like\nGilbert's super high level submission grappling. - Yeah. But he's pretty widely\nrecognized as a monster. So, I don't know if that's even the right answer to the question. It's like you're not\neven listening anymore. - I don't even remember. What was the question?\n- [Lex] Doesn't matter. (laughter) All right, well... Is there people, like you've done all these\nseminars are they're just, especially in the eastern\nblock that you see. - [Craig] Ah, yeah. - Like you went to Kazakhstan. Is there killers out there that? - Oh yeah, there's tough guys out there. Obviously, I don't remember the names, nor could I pronounce it if I did. But, definitely some tough guys out there. Obviously carrying skill sets\nover from wrestling for sure. Not Sambo, but wrestling. - Wrestling. But yeah, are there just\npeople that surprise you that just don't compete\nthat are really good? Have you met those? - I feel like it's less so\ntoday, cause there's so many, so many more athletes in the sport. But definitely when I was coming up, back like in Australian and stuff, there were guys I'd trained\nwith that wouldn't compete and there would be like\nsuper tough rounds for me. - [Lex] Yeah. And there's so many more avenues\nfor competing in general, so, yeah. What about you? Have you met some monsters? - Yeah, one guy I could think\nof in particular is Jason Rau. He trains up in Long Island, I think. Right? Opened up his own gym out there. - [Craig] Vanguard? - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah, Vanguard. He used to compete, but he would never be able\nto compete at the same level he would train at. So, now he's just focused on mainly, you know, opening up a gym\nand teaching his students. But he was a guy that was, you know, extremely good in the training room. You know, world class. I still think to this\nday he's legitimately one of the best in the world, but just doesn't compete anymore."

No, not a polar-- Well, yes, it's a good ques-- See, you're on-- Polar bear is pretty impressive. No, grizzly bear. - Grizzly bear. I think a grizzly bear wins. - Well, what's the most\nthreatening predator in Australia? A kangaroo?\n- Well, I mean, it's a tricky question here, cause everyone's scared of\nthe animals in Australia. But I mean, you get bitten by a snake, bitten by spider.\n- [Lex] True. - That's not that bad. Bear. America, bear would just\nhold you down to eat you. That's a much more\nterrifying prospect for me. Even sharks. Shark's gonna be quick. No one sees the shark coming. The shark's just gonna bite you in half. - [Lex] A bear will take a bite and chew. - A bear just holds you down and eats you. So, that's frightening for me. Australia's a bunch of just\nweird shit that can kill you. - Did you see Cocaine Bear\nthe movie that's coming out? - I saw the trailer. It looks good. - [Lex] Yeah. Yeah. So, there's not every bear. There's like black belts\nand there's black belts, there's bears and there's bears. So that, I think that's what they\noften don't talk about. Everybody puts lions and\nbears in the same category. I think there's just some weak bears. - A lion would kill a black bear, I think. - Not every black, again,\nI'm trying to tell you, there's differences.\n(laughter) - But grizzly and polar\nbear, I'm betting on those. - Yeah, no, I think\ngrizzlies have the size, but actually every video\nI've seen of grizzlies, they tire out within like 20 seconds. They get bored. - That's the gas thing? - [Lex] Yeah, that's the gas thing. - That's a Nicky Ryan gas thing, right? - That's all they got. Tree mold.\n(laughter) - And they try to just take a breather. Like there's these crazy\nfights between bears and they last like 20 seconds. - I heard this story\nabout a Russian family that was attacked by a bear\nin Russia and killed the dad. And it took so it took so\nlong to eat the daughter, she made three phone calls to her mom while it was eating her. And the first call, the mum\nthought she was pranking her. - [Lex] That's crazy. - That's way scarier than what we thought. - [Lex] Yeah, that's terrifying. - Gimme a snake bite any day. - [Lex] Yeah. Hey, you know what?\nLet me change the question. Is like, if you had to\nfight a bear or a lion, how would you try to defeat it? Do you think you have a chance at all? - Well, I think I'd, I'd attack a lion a little bit differently than I'd attack a bear. - What would be the difference? - Okay. Well, I've seen this video where lions are eating and you\nhave three like scrinny guys walk up behind them and\nkind of scare the cat off of - Yeah.\n- Off their food. I think, maybe I produce some\nprops, scare the lion away. Right? But if I have to fight it, if I have to fight it straight on, I mean, the thing is that you can't,\neven if you take that back, like you can't like bite it or choke it. The mane is too big to lock\nyour hands around, you know? - Are you sure about that? Cause the mane's just hair. - Yeah, the mane's hair. - [Nicky Rod] Yeah, but it's thick hair. It's like matted hair, right? I dunno. So, I think, - You think you can maintain\nback control on a lion? - Maintain, yeah, yeah.\n(laughter) But, getting there. Getting there, I think I fake high go low. Right? Make 'em think I'm going\nfor the foot or something. A little paw sweep and I take the back. - What about a bear? I feel like they're easier. That might be easier to\ntake to hold back control. - Yeah, maybe, The thing is if the\nbear falls on its back, it's just gonna crush you. It's so big. It's substantially bigger\nthan a lion, right? Like a full grown lion. - Yeah. And they're also like terrifyingly like, loud with their roars and stuff. - Yeah, I think, So, first of all, if I saw\ngrizzly I'm like, all right, he's gonna attack me. I try to yell a little bit louder to them, maybe deter him a little bit. Like, give him a (grunts softly). - Yeah. - And then yeah, for sure, I'd try to get behind it. I'd probably go like something weird. Maybe like pull the eyes\nout or something, you know? For sure. I mean, I'm going for the\nvital organs, you know? - Play dead.\n- [Nicky Rod] Play dead. - And then over check it. (Lex laughs)\n- There's no pride in that. - Wow. Pride even matters. See the ego, the same advice you gave, you gotta put the ego aside with the bear. Even then, even then. How would you fight a bear or a lion? Just play dead? - Play dead, yeah. Could you beat a kangaroo? A kangaroo? - [Lex] Oh, yeah.\n- Kangaroo? I'd beat the shit out of a kangaroo. (laughter) Yeah, yeah. I mean, are we boxing glove? We just like-- - How would a kangaroo attack a human? - Try to kick 'em with the claws. - Knock 'em down and then they choke 'em. - [Nicky Rod] Stand on that tail. - The kangaroos do? - [Craig] They choke each other, yeah. - They don't choke each other. - [Craig] You don't believe me? You gotta watch the video,\nthey choke each other out. (Nicky Ryan chuckles) - I've seen this, yeah. (laughter) - It's real?\n- [Craig] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - With which? Headlock or what? - Yeah, they knock 'em, and just grip like this and hold 'em. - [Lex] What's the grip? They have like little paws. How are they gripping? - [Craig] I promise you. I'm not lying to you. - [Nicky Ryan] Pretty\nsure I've seen the video. - [Lex] They also do strange shit like if there's a predator around, they'll wait in a pool of water. And then if it comes to\nattack, they drown 'em. They're pretty smart. (Lex chuckles) - Okay."

I think you've talked\nabout being in a street-- Have you ever been in a street fight? - Yeah, just one. - [Lex] Yeah. - Nothing special. Nothing crazy. - [Lex] Yeah, you don't\ntalk about that time? Like, for self-defense purposes, what will be a strategy on the street? A little advice. - Whoever wins the street fights, whoever's willing to take it\nthe furthest, the fastest. You know what I mean? If you're thinking you're\ngonna box and he's biting you, poking your eyes, that guy's gonna win. He wants it more, you know what I mean? That's why the crackheads fight. They go for the kill\nstraight away, you know? So, I feel like it's more about\nwho's willing to do the most that's gonna win that fight. - Fastest. The most, the fastest. - Who's got the least to lose, you know? - Okay, we could also\ndefine winning differently cause you could also run away. But in terms of technique-wise, wrestling? Judo? - I think if it's a one-on-one, I'd go, wrestler wins. But, if it's like, you know,\nit's like a multiple people, you gotta go Muay Thai,\nstay on their feet. Can't go down to the ground\nif it's more than one person. - Big double leg maybe. - Yeah. Double leg, put 'em asleep\non the impact, right? Forehead to the ground. - Yeah.\nWhat's the goal here? Is to win the fight and not go to prison? - I haven't thought of\nit through that way. (Craig laughs) Yeah, certainly. Yeah. Yeah. Not go, not to kill the person. - We got mutual combat\nhere in Texas, we good. - Is that in Texas?\n- Mhm. - Do you know what the\npaperwork for that looks like? Do you have to actually sign\nsomething, or can you just say? - I hope I don't need to find out. (Lex chuckles) I did hear a story where\nguys were on Sixth Street and they looked at a cop. They were like mutual\ncombat, mutual combat. - Yeah. - And just got like the cops to say yes and just duped it out. They could be false though. - That sounds crazy. - [Nicky Rod] I'm saying. - I kind of admire that, but I've also been playing\nRed Dead Redemption recently. So, I like internalized the\ncowboy a little too much."

      "section": "Money and friendship",
      "text": "Just to return to gym stuff. No, because it's a business. Because you're running a\nbusiness, there's money involved. But, you're also friends. But, you're also training partners. Is there a tension that money creates that can threaten to destroy friendships? That's something I always\nworry about with money. I try not to go do any kind of business with friends or family. - I think if you're all very\nclear and honest and open at the start, makes it much easier. I think people have\nissues when there's like, kind of like things are\nwritten and fine print, and nobody knows the exact answers. - And a lot of jiu-jitsu guys can't read. You know, that makes\nit challenging as well. - [Lex] We're learning that today. - Yeah.\n(laughter) - [Lex] Uh, no. - Definitely complicated though. - Yeah I mean, it's not always obvious how to be transparent and\nstuff about everything. Have you felt that tension? Because in the jiu-jitsu world, money's not really unlimited. Just running a school. What's that like? Because it's the first time\nyou're running a school, running a gym. - Yeah, I mean it's just\nconstantly updating people about what's going on, what your expectations are. You know what I mean? We've had some problems with coaches who I feel like think the\npies bigger than it is. You know what I mean? They feel like maybe we're\ngetting rich out of this, and they're missing out on things. So, it's like even amongst managing staff, that can be challenging too. So yeah, I mean it's a constant\nwork in progress to make. Not only to make sure everyone's happy, But to make sure they're\ncomfortable enough to reach out and tell you they're unhappy. But I feel like those\nchallenges are common amongst any small business. - Still, it sucks. Just to mention, I'm clueless to this. But I'm just now learning this. Somebody I met and talked to\nand I really like is Isaac. And he just learned because\nyou're also active on Reddit. What's your name on Reddit? John Belushi's mom.\n- John Belushi. As under cover as possible, you know? - Oh, it's not you. It's actually John Belushi's mom. Right. (chuckles) So, I've done my research, I guess. And I guess you guys had a\nfalling out and have split. I just wanna say that, I don't know the few\ninteractions I've had with him, he's a beautiful human being. So. And that just shows to me, - Visually, maybe not internally. - And sexually, just the experience. No. He's just a kind person. I don't know. I liked him a lot. Like to me, in a business setting, yeah, tensions are created and it sucks. I don't know. I mean, I suppose money, all the stuff that happened\nin the jungle aside, probably money had a role to\nplay to create extra tension. Money and egos about\nlike who was the leader, who was not the leader, it's tough. It's tough to manage that kind of stuff. I've seen it happen with\njiu-jitsu schools a lot. I don't know exactly what. Cause it's like there's\nalso a hierarchy inside grappling jiu-jitsu schools. Like people that are better or not. There's literally ranks\nblack belt and brown belt. There's like competitors that are better. I mean I don't, it's a weird dynamic in which to operate. Cause like usually, there's more politeness and like humanity layered into the way a company works. But here there's just a bunch of, I mean, it's like violence\nlaid on and on display. Plus money. It's crazy. Is there something you could say to that? Like, how you try to minimize? Or something you want to comment on Isaac? - Yeah, I mean it was\nunfortunate situation. But it just didn't work out. You know, like, there's\ngonna be personality clashes. Some people... - I can't imagine anyone having a personality clash with you. - [Craig] With me?\n- Yeah. - It's hard to imagine. - Yeah, it's surprising. You know, I mean, I don't\neven know what to say on that. I don't want to touch on it too much, but obviously his expectations\nabout his role in the gym, obviously different from ours. Led to some personality clashes that were sort of unresolvable. You know, some things happen\nthat can't be resolved. You can't fix those things.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - You know? Obviously, a lesson I hope for both of us. Definitely a lesson for\nme from a management role to try to address these things sooner. But also, sometimes I came\nup in a different time where there was no\nmoney, no opportunities. I had to pave that. I had to pave that way totally for myself. Especially coming from Australia. Like, being a professional\nathlete in jiu-jitsu was not, I think so I had to pave a lot\nof opportunities for myself. And I feel like sometimes, ohh, I don't know what the right word is. Sometimes people don't appreciate some of the ways you help them. And they just think, feel like almost they deserve or are entitled to certain things. And that is very difficult to manage. But I think again, like we both\nsee the situation different. I do hope he finds a better, a more comfortable place to train. But yeah, obviously I've\nknown him for a long time. Sort of like a brotherly relationship. So, that's gonna really make\npersonal problems a lot worse when you're that close\nto someone, you know? - I just hated that like I've\nseen in jiu-jitsu especially, but in other places, where like close\nfriendships were destroyed because of like gym stuff. Like, people running gyms. And as a person who is, in this case just a fan, but like in general, just like a student, it like sucks. - But again, in my position, sometimes I wonder if there\nreally was a friendship or mere opportunity. I have to be careful of that\nwith some people in the sport. Is it a sincere relationship? Or like, I mean it's\ndifficult for me to tell. Or am I means to an end? - Sure. But I think it's actually a trade off because I think a lot of\nclose friendships we have like even relationships we have. Like, when tested, like, can break if they're\nnot properly communicated. Like, some of it could\nbe just misunderstanding for a prolonged period of time. It's not explained to religious. Just like a lack of integrity. It's just like you have to\nlike talk through that shit. Like, just be honest with each other. - Take some MDMA, or\nreally get down to it. - Drugs solve everything.\n(Craig chuckles) If you've learned anything\nfrom this conversation. I've actually haven't done MDMA yet. People say that that's\nsomething I would enjoy a lot cause my brain is I think natural on MDMA. - I'd recommend it for sure. - [Lex] For sure. All right. - Is that what you did with Gabby? Okay, nevermind. - She drugged me. (laughter) - In general, why is there\nalways seems to be drama in the jiu-jitsu world? Like outside of what's going on here. Or is that just, - I think it's universal to anything. - [Lex] Drama's everywhere? And then drama rises to the surface. - Drama makes the money. - [Lex] Yeah. I wish there was a little bit less. You have a bunch of-- Like, we mentioned some of them. You have a bunch of instructionals out. What are some interesting things\nthat you're looking forward to like exploring in terms of teaching? So, \"Just Stand Up\" is your\nmost recent one, right? Yeah. You also have one called, \"Power Bottom, An Inclusive Modern\nApproach to the Guard.\" (light chuckling) - [Craig] Yep. Yep. - [Lex] What are some other ones? - [Craig] \"False Reap Allegations\" - \"False Reap Allegations\", yeah. By the way people talk\nabout \"Power Bottom\", again, hilarious title. But they say it's a\nreally good instructional, unlike the guard. - Yeah, I try to at least\nbe innovative, you know? Like, everyone else I\nfeel like's ripping off John and Gordon, putting\nsome sort of slant on that. So, I'm trying to take sort\nof a different approach. I think you can actively\ninfluence the sport with what you release\ncause people are gonna try to emulate that. So, I think those type of instructionals, \"Just Stand Up\", \"Power Bottom,\" like approaching the sport differently, I think definitely has\na positive impact on how people play the game. - Are you working on something now? - Probably a fundamentals course. Just cause we're bringing out, we've got the white\nbelt program coming in, so I'm trying to develop\na fundamentals course along the line of the\nconstraint based learning stuff we were talking about today. Like, a way to approach\nlearning as a beginner to sort of speed up the process a bit and not make it as so technique dense. At least have it a bit more fun. - And focusing in on just like, examples of problems to solve. - Exactly, yeah. Approaching jiu-jitsu, learning that way. Like, I mean, kids learn\nquick through games. I think adults are capable of that to a certain extent as well. - You're releasing that instructional on pre-match preparation?\n- Yes. - What other stuff? Do you ever think on a body lock pass? - Yeah, I have a body\nlock or Rody lock DVD, or instructional. Yeah, I had the pre-match\nritual coming out. I also have, I'm filming, \"How to Build\nAthleticism for Grappling.\" I'm just really trying to\ncapture different angles. Kind of like the same, you\nknow, what Craig's doing. Trying not to do the same\nthing that everybody else does. You know? There's a ton of wrestling, ton\nof jiu-jitsu instructionals. - And the steroid results are coming in. - Oh yeah, yeah. More plates, more dates. You know, Derek that runs that, hit me up for a blood panel test, like an impromptu thing. And I did it a few days ago, and I believe the results\nwill come out shortly. - Oh yeah? Do you know the results? - What are you betting on, Lex? - What do you think? It's hard to believe. I know. - Yeah, it's very, very impressive. (laughter) You're putting me in\nawkward position here. (laughter) Do you think you'll face Gordon soon? - I'm open to it. I don't know how soon, maybe in the next six months. I could see me facing\nhim before ADCC Worlds. - I think that's a great rivalry. I think it's a really interesting one. - It's fun for me. - Is there any chance that the two, the Soviet Union and Nazi\nGermany get back together? That DDS under whatever\nname gets back together? - No. Absolutely not. - Highly unlikely. I mean, we kind of did this to, you know, to back up Nicky Ryan and, you know, we're sticking with our guy. - So, what do you think? - Yeah, I think there's just\ntoo many personality conflicts for it to really ever work again. - Do you think there will\nalways be war in the world? - War?\n- Yeah. - Oh yeah. I think from the beginning of time, it's been, you know, some kind\nof war, some kind of battle. Controversy, it's what\nhelps people evolve. - Until AI, super intelligent AI becomes way more powerful than humans. And humbles all of us with its\npower before it destroys us. - Well, until it runs outta batteries. (laughter) You guys are screwed. (laughter) - Just unplug it. - That's awesome. I'm really fortunate to be\nable to hang out with you, to train with you. And thank you so much for talking today. This was-- - All right. - That's the best ending.

Who together with Ethan\nCranston, and others make up the B-Team, a legendary jiu-jitsu team\nhere in Austin, Texas. It was formed after the\nso-called Danaher Death Squad. The team headed by John Danaher split up into New Wave Jiu-Jitsu\nand B-Team Jiu-Jitsu. Both located here in Austin, Texas. There has been a lot of\ntrash talk back and forth, including accusations of\ngreasing and steroid use. And I, as a practitioner and\nfan of grappling, jiu-jitsu, and martial arts in general, am here for it. To see the best grapplers in history go at it both on the mat and on Instagram. I like the people on both teams, and train with both. And am really happy to see\nthe exciting rapid evolution of the sport that these athletes\nand coaches are catalyzing. This is, The Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Craig Jones, Nicky\nRod, and Nicky Ryan. Craig, can you introduce everyone? - Yep. So, we got Nicky Rod here. Brown belt, two-time ADCC silver medalist. Nicky Ryan, here. That's it. (laughter) - Okay. Who are you? - And I'm Craig Jones. Also, two-time ADCC silver medalist. - Silver medalist. So, the number one loser. - Number one loser. - And maybe a little bit more, your bio says, \"Widely known\nas the black belt slayer, hails from New Jersey, the\nland of pizza and biceps.\" - Ah, yes. That's pretty accurate. - Okay. You also do carry a gun on you a lot? - Yeah. I keep it loaded, you know?\n- Yeah. - Keep it on me.\n- Uh huh. - Do you have one today? - Uh, in the car. - That was a mistake. That was your first mistake. - Yeah, I think you're too close. (laughter) - It's very uncomfortable. - And you are Nicky\nRyan, what else is there? What else do we know? - Gordon Ryan's brother. - Gordon Ryan's brother. - Thanks for that one. (laughter) - All right. So, and you're all together\npart of the leadership of the the B-Team here in Austin. Let's just get out some\nintroductory questions. What in general, accomplishment\nof the things you mentioned are you most proud of? - I mean, I'm proud\njust to not have to work a full-time job just to get by on the bullshit I've done so far. - Yeah.\n- Honestly. - [Lex] Just making money\nof a thing you love. - Exactly, yeah. - When was the first time you made money on a thing you love? - Oh, probably a jiu-jitsu tournament. I think maybe in Abu Dhabi\nwhere I won a thousand dollars. Thought I was rich. - Yeah, yeah. What'd you spend a thousand dollars on? - Probably something bad? Probably drugs or something at the time. Maybe blew it at the after party. (light chuckling) - That's a good introduction to Craig. So, what about you? When's the first time you\nmade money on jiu-jitsu? Or, what's-- Actually, stepping back, like, what's the thing\nyou're most proud of? Is it a similar kind of thing? - I think I'm most proud of is, I mean, for sure two ADCC silver medals, which hurts cause you're so\nclose to getting that gold. But, you know, it takes time. I'm understanding that, you know, the sport of\njiu-jitsu takes quite a while to be at the tip top to\nbe the absolute best. So, and I'm just being\nconsistent in my training and my craft and, you know, I'll get that number one spot one day. - What failure or loss is\nthe most painful to you? - I don't know. I have probably a pretty\nshort term memory. So my losses, I just like,\nI'll just forget about 'em. Yeah, I mean, for sure my loss at this\npast ADCC in the finals, you know, that one stung a bit, cause I definitely\nthought I was gonna win. I mean, like, it takes a\nwhile to produce the skills or the reactions more\nso, that you need to have to be, you know, to be that\nnumber one pound for pound guy. And, you know, pre-ADCC, I was coming off of\ninjury so it took me a little bit to find the right\nmentality and physicality that I needed in order to, you know, get the wins that required gold. So yeah, it's just a process. - Interesting. You keep saying process, like\nit takes a while to build up. So, you're not like thinking of a loss, like ADCC as like a specific failure. You haven't gone long enough\nin a particular process to being a champ. - Well, I mean, for me, I'm closing in on five\nyears of specifically jiu-jitsu training. I'm at about four and a half right now. And yeah, it's just the, you constantly have these\nups and downs in training where like, as long as\nyou stay consistent, you'll have a gradual raise. But you know, it's still, you'll have these peaks and lows. And you know, just trying\nto get better every day. I'm definitely not where I will\nbe in a few years from now, but I'm striving to get there. - Are you actually a brown belt? Or was that a joke? - Brown belt, yeah. - You're a brown belt. Like how many stripes? - No stripes. - No stripes. Okay.\n- Stripeless. - Okay. Is that part of the process,\nthat you're working through? - Definitely part of the process. I mean, I think a black belt is\njust based upon how much knowledge you have. Obviously, like, you know, if you're talking competitive wise, like from when I started, I was able to beat most black belts. That's just kind of how I was gifted from my wrestling experience. And you know, the time\nwill come when it's right, but I'm not in a rush at all. I'm continuing. I just kind of take\nevery day for what it is, and try to improve upon that. - I mean, I wanna give him the black belt. Nicky Ryan says he's not ready. (Nicky Rod laughs) - Are you guys, like as No-Gi folks, do you take that seriously? Like, the black belt? Or like, how much does\nit come into play into-- - Yeah, I mean it's like\nNicky Rod said, you know, it's based off of knowledge, not just, you know, what you do out\non the competition mats. Cause you know, like he said, he had years of wrestling experience, and obviously he's very physically gifted. So, we grade based off of\nthe amount of knowledge that you have. - Like, how do you measure knowledge? - I think teaching is a\ngood measurement of it. Like, how well you're\nable to show the moves, and you know, really\nmake sure that you have an understanding of what you're doing. - Yeah. It's an interesting rank. It's like, it's something that takes\nmany years to accomplish, and for a lot of people\nit's truly meaningful. It's like it represents a\nparticular step in a journey. But for you guys, it's almost like different, because you've been so\nfocused on competition that I guess if you take it seriously, it is a big step for you too, like as martial artists,\nthat's bigger than just being like top of the world competitors, right? So, I thought it was a joke. You guys are actually taking it seriously. Like--\n- That he's a brown belt. - That he's a brown belt and he's, and you're taken seriously, the rank of black belt and like, it's part of your journey. - I think by the time I get a black belt, I'll be no more pound for a pound. I think it'd be pretty\nnice to accomplish that as a brown belt and then maybe\ntoss a black belt on top. - Maybe get promoted on the podium. What do you guys, do you love winning or hate losing more? - I definitely don't hate losing. If it pays the bills, I don't mind. - [Lex] Oh really? - Yeah. But, honestly if I win I feel\nmore relief than anything rather than like excitement and stuff. I'm like, \"Oh, thank God that's over.\" You know?\n- What about you? - I hate losing for sure. But I understand that it's\nnecessary to get, you know, to get to where you want to be. And then winning is like, I mean, what I think winning is probably the closest you can think, you can get to like heroin or something. Cause I mean we're on a high-- Like if you do have extreme success in a tournament that\nyou've been, you know, adamant about training for,\nand competing in for a while and you end up winning it, I mean I feel like you're on that high for days at a time afterwards. - Heroin's gotta be better. - You think so? I'ma stick with no, but. - I'm not gonna suck dick to win. (laughter) - You sucked dick for heroin? (laughs) Okay. I guess that's a good point. Yeah. - But you know like, because you coming from a little bit of the wrestling culture. One of the things I really\nlove is at the end of the match when they lose they just, there's no, they just run off. - Yeah. - They're like almost pissed off. It's like some mixture\nof anger and frustration at themselves. - I think sometimes that people\nlike freak out on the mat. And I think that's just to show everybody, like, they're acting\nlike they cared a lot. And really maybe they didn't\nwork enough to you know, get to where they want to, where they expected to be. And they lost and then they\nhad this big boost of emotion like after their loss. But yeah, I mean, I think, you just cry in the mirror not to everybody else, you know? - Have you ever cried watching a movie? - I don't think I've ever cried, period. - Okay. Have you cried watching a movie? - Not yet. Not yet. - The notebook. - [Craig] I try to avoid those movies. Actually, - Lion King,\n- I lie. Actually,\n- Titanic. - The last part of a\ndifficult wake up for me is I try to find a sad\nmovie and at least cry about a pound out. That really gets me over the line. Low energy, cutting. - The tears. (chuckling) There's other following liquids\nI could talk to you about, but let's just continue on. - Low energy. - What about you, Nicky? Love of winning versus hate of losing? - I'm a very competitive person. So, I for sure hate losing\nmore than I like winning. I do think it's something\nthat's kind of held me back over the past few years cause, it makes it so that I'm not\nas active as I should be. Cause it's like I really hate\nthat feeling of, you know, after a match that you just lost. So, it kind of prevents me from competing. So, it's definitely something\nI need to work past. - So, like when you think\nabout a competition, the possibility of losing, which is always there in competition, is the thing that like weighs heavy on you in the months and weeks leading up to it? - Yeah, my whole life, you\nknow, my financial stability, everything depends on, you know, my ability to go out there and compete, and my ability to teach. So, you know, it's a huge\nhit to the brand if you lose. So, you know, leading up to matches. That's definitely something\nthat's in my mind. - So, you guys are like\nworld class athletes, but for me, more like\na hobbyist competitor. I compete a lot. The thing I was-- Cause I really wanted to win. The thing I was probably most\nafraid of was not just losing, but like embarrassing myself. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah. - Even actually winning by stalling. That was the thing I hated\nthe most about myself, in terms of crying in the mirror, is like being too afraid to take risks after I'm up\non two points or something. - I think you gotta, in competition, sometimes it's good to\ntake the emotion out of it. It's too easy sometimes\nto like think about, oh my girls in the crowd\nand my family's watching. Like, I wanna win cause they're there. But at the highest level,\nif you're emotional at all, that's affecting you. - Yeah. That's tough though. (lightly chuckles)\nThat's tough. Especially like leading up to\nwhen you're on the map maybe, but leading up to it. - I think it's okay to be emotional prior. Like, you know, if we know ADCC or it's coming\nup and we have a big match, like definitely I'll go out and practice, and I'll visualize, I'll put myself in that competition. That way when it's game time, it's like, I've been there\na thousand times already. - So, not the actual competition,\nbut even leading up to it, like stepping on the\nmat, like all the walk, walk towards it, all that. - All that stuff. Like, I'll do the same exact\nwarmup for weeks on end until my competition day comes. That way, you know, when I compete I'm just like, Oh, it's another Tuesday at practice. - What about you, Craig? Like, how do you prepare\nmentally for tournament like ADCC? - I push it completely outta my mind. Don't even think about it. Try to avoid any visualization, any rituals, warmups, anything like that. Block it out until the last second. Yeah. Try not to think about it. I just kinda train to\nhave fun, learn a bit. So, I try to approach\ncompetition the exact same way. I don't warm up in training, do very little warmup for competition. - Uh huh. And do you just step on the mat? - Step on the mats. My philosophy is there's\nno warmups on the street. (chuckling) - We're so vastly different. (laughter) - All right. So, you like legit don't warm up? - No, I probably should now I'm 31. But I would just like in the gym, take it easy the first round. You know, like if I look around the room and Nicky Ryan's down, might go, \"All right, we'll have an\neasier first round today, so.\" (light chuckling) - So even for like the\nmost high stakes matches, you try to push it out. - Yeah, I didn't even think about it. - What about like all the social, like Instagram posts you\nhave to do about that match? You just make a joke\nout of it and kind of-- - Yeah. I mean, it's all kind of pretty silly. You know? We're just wrestling each other, you know? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- We put the meaning into it. But to someone that\ndoesn't follow the sport, it looks stupid. - Well all of human\nexistence is pretty silly. Like what are we doing? None of us really know what's going on. We kind of have sex to reproduce. We get hungry, we eat. And then we're all chasing money and cars, and whatever the hell,\nin a capital society. Or we worship a dictator\nin a authoritarian regime. Yeah. And then we get off on, we'll let power abuse us and\nthen we just murder others because we get off on it. Yeah. And then eventually all of us will die because the sun will run out of energy. Cause colonizing other\nplanets is very difficult. So, none of it matters. It's a good, good philosophy. It's pretty good. - That's exactly what I was thinking. - How does the sun run out of energy? (laughter) You caught me there. - It burn out. It's like a, it's a nuclear fusion engine\nand eventually burns out. - Like, when you get tired at training. - Yeah. It's never happened. I try to get tired. I was like, dude, it's like dude's like I not working. (laughter) - All right, cool. So, you legit don't care about losing? It doesn't weigh heavy on you. - I try not to list-- Like if I win, I try to block\nout all the compliments, all the niceties and stuff. So, I try to do the same with losing. It's happened. Move on to the next one. You know, don't dwell on it too much. - And sometimes make a joke out of it. - Yeah, exactly. Winning or losing, with the right joke, we can make money off of the\nevent that's just transpired. That's what's most important. - Excellent. Thank you. I have a bunch of your merch. - Oh nice. This one's the Jordan Burrow's rip off. - All I see is silver. The way he pronounce burrows is very sexy. Okay. - I throw lines at people and\nI try to gauge their reaction. Like sometimes I'll say something\nto Nicky and I'll be like, all right, that's probably\ncrossing the line. You know what I mean? We'll tone it down to the public. - So, what-- Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's not just right. You have to think, is\nthis crossing the line? - Yeah, yeah. I get as close to it as possible. Yeah. I feel like he can't really-- - And then cross it. Just a little bit. - Just a little bit, yeah. - Okay. Speaking of which, you said that I'm\nSwitzerland in World War II since I'm friends with both\nyou and Gordon and John. - Yeah. Very rich country. - Are you a Hitler or a Stalin\nby the way, in this analogy? Would you like to be Hitler or Stalin? And should you make a\nT-shirt out of it or? - I mean, honestly a T-shirt, I don't know how well that sells. You know?\n- I think it would, you know, I think that--\n(chuckles) Let's brainstorm on this one offline. (laughter) I think since Hitler lost. So, you got second place in World War II. - That's true. That's true. - I think that makes you Hitler. Anyway, to the degree that you can, can you tell the story of how\nthe time you've had with the Danaher Death Squad and why you split up? - I competed against Gordon for ADCC and EBI in 2017. And I remember I competed\nagainst him at a ADCC and then we had the EBI event, and then I had a Kasai. I used to compete all\nthe time, every week. I wouldn't even do the\npreparation or anything. I'd just be like trying to do seminars, make money and then jump in and compete. I remember I showed up to\nKasai after I faced him twice. And there were like four locker rooms, and they put me with all the DDS guys. It was just me and all of DDS. And I think we had competed\nthe weekend before. So, I thought it was\ngonna be super awkward, but it was actually, it was actually pretty chill. And the Kasai was in New York, and they suggested to\ncome train that week. So I came trained, hung\nout with 'em a bit. Ultimately, the goal\nwas to move to America and join a bigger team\njust cause that flight to Australia is death. Australia is so far away from everywhere. It's kind of like, not realistic to base\nyourself in Australia when all the tournaments are in America. And then I went and trained with the guys and they just had a massive, massively deep talent pool in that room. Like show up to like\na meant to be 7:00 AM, actually 8:00 AM class, on Brazilian time. And there'd be like a\nhundred people in there, maybe, I don't know how many black belts, but a ton of elite guys. And I was coming from Australia\ntraining with Lachlan Giles. But really, that room was pretty shallow and like most people had\nserious jobs and stuff. So, it was like basically me\njust training with Lachlan, maybe a couple of other guys. And then to go to New\nYork and have access to a wide array of training partners, and guys that are training twice each day. I feel like that's what you really need. You need people that can\ntrain as much as you are. - You get humbled? - Humbled? - Do you get humbled\nin that room at first? - For sure. Cause my style at the time was basically a rip off version of what they were doing. - [Lex] Yeah. - Leg locks came in. I remember just watching\nEddie Cummings nonstop, and just seeing this guy\nrip people's legs off and I was like, \"You know what? That's probably a good move.\" You know, that looks like an easier path to victory than trying to beat these guys at what they're good at already. You know? My philosophy at the time was, if it's bothering old Brazilians, - [Lex] Yeah. - It's bothering them for a reason. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It's probably effective. And that's the path I took to sort of try to rip off their moves, and then obviously to go into that room, try to do 'em to them, it's\ngonna be a bit more difficult. - All right. So, that's how it started. How did you end up here? - How do we end up here? - We're in Austin, Texas. - I mean, I like to think of\nPuerto Rico as Apocalypse now. John Danaher as Colonel Kurtz. Things got very weird in the jungle, and the teams went into\ndifferent interactions. But honestly, I mean it's\nnot really my story to tell. I had some issues with\nsome of those people. At the time of the split, I\ngot along very well with John. I feel like me and him\nconnected very well. I don't know why that was. Maybe it was just cause of, he missed home. He missed the familiar accent. Australian-New Zealand accent. But, I mean, I basically followed Nicky. - [Lex] Yeah. - Left with Nicky. Sort of that core group\nof guys left with Nicky. And I mean, I just backed, there was personal problems, and I just backed Nicky, basically. - Got it. Just sticking on you for a bit. Is there a part of you that, you know, finds it heartbreaking that DDS split up? Does part of you miss working\nwith John and everybody? Can you steal me on the case for that? - I mean, I miss certain aspects of it, but I also do prefer the\nfreedom of being apart from it. It's obviously a very strict\nregime under John Danaher. You know, obviously there's parts of it. I miss the parts that the\npublic doesn't see of John, the behind the scenes banter. I feel like he's very\nconscious of the imagery he portrays to the world. But basically, closed doors, he's always making jokes, always finding, I guess, more in line with the Australian Kiwi sort of culture. But you don't really see\nthat in the public eye. So that perspective, I do miss\nthat relationship with John. In terms of setting aside\npersonal differences, Gordon was a good training partner. Definitely a good training\npartner to train with. But obviously, the negative things we can't really talk about\noutweighed all of those things. And we obviously had to make\na decision to leave, but yeah. - What is that happening in the jungle? - The things happen in the jungle. - Shall never be spoken of. - That I personally cannot speak of. Yeah, but obviously I do\nmiss certain aspects like, I mean, nothing's all bad,\nnothing's all good, you know? - Yeah. This goes back to your like, everything we're doing is silly. - Yeah, exactly. That's why I didn't get\npeople take it so serious. Martial arts so serious. It's just... It's just pretty stupid really. Especially in the Gi, it\nlooks just, it looks bad. And then obviously--\n- I mean, it's pretty silly with and without the Gi. It's just a bunch of apes rolling around. - What's silly about No-Gi\nand what's silly about the Gi and just mixed and match bottoms there, you know what I mean? - Wait, which one?\n- Sambo. Yeah.\n(laughs) - I see what you're doing. Brother. (laughter) You come to my house and defend my people. All right. (chuckling) We're gonna go to every\ndark place, apparently. Nick, how did you get with DDS? Like what was that journey like? Is there, try to see if there's things\nthat you remember fondly, that you've gotten from the experience. - All right, so the way I\nstarted training with DDS, initially I was training for like, well initially I was a bouncer, right? I dropped outta college to pursue this fitness modeling career. I ended up signing with a\nWilhelmina models up in New York, and I was like trying\nto get in better shape. And while I was bouncing kind\nof the talk of like, you know, whose tougher came up\nbetween the wrestlers and a few of the bouncers\nthat trained jiu-jitsu. And you know, they convinced\nme to go to a practice. And I went to my first\npractice over there, and for the most part, I just controlled everybody,\ngot on top of 'em, was able to avoid like, kind of like, you know, shitty submissions. Cause I had an awareness of the sport, and you know, I'm a fan\nof fighting and whatnot. So, you know, I kind of\nunderstood it pretty well. And then soon after\nthat I joined a school, and my second week of\njiu-jitsu I started competing. Had pretty good success. You know, I was like\nsubbing a few black belts, and beating everybody like, you know, pretty decisively with points and stuff. And about three months\ninto training locally, I got connected with Gordon\nRyan and John Danaher up in New York. And I started, I committed to, you know, make the drive up there\nas many days as I could. At the time I lived in South Jersey, and it was about two and a\nhalf hour, three hour drive without traffic to New York. - Where in South Jersey? - Gloucester County. Clayton, New Jersey specifically,\nbut Gloucester County. Yeah. So, it was about 130 miles. And without traffic, it was about two and a half hours or so. But on the way back, man, we,\nit'd be three plus sometimes, you know, you're catching that rush hour. - What year was this? Do you remember? - This was in 2018. - I forget how young you are. I was there before, before all that. All right, cool. Anyway, you're doing the\nlong drive and then what? - Yeah, doing the long drive and then, you know, once I won ADCC trials, I was able to make a couple bucks. And then, you know, I got\nmy silver medal at ADCC, and I was able to afford to\nlive up there in New York, in north Jersey area. So I lived up there, trained there full-time\nevery day and you know, just kind of stuck with\nthe team throughout the turbulent times and\nfound ourself in Austin. - In the jungle. - In the jungle, yeah. - One of the things we shall not speak of. What, are there things that you remember that you've learned from John Danaher from your time you spent with him? - Yeah, I mean I definitely\nlearned a ton from John and the team as a whole. Like, you know, you have to be the guy that asks questions in that type type of environment, right? Cause there's not, it's not, you're not gonna get singled\nout to be that specific like star or the the best guy in the\nroom when you have all these other, you know, stud athletes. So, I really had to\nseek out and figure out the kind of questions\nthat I needed to ask. And once I became a bit\nmore verbal with my training and you know, I'm showing, I'm expressing all my curiosities\nabout grappling to these guys definitely helped boost my technique and my career as a whole. - Yeah. Did you understand what kind of stuff, like technically you want to get good at, what fits your body? What, like, what would be good for you? What are your weaknesses and all that? - So initially, and when\nI started grappling, I had an innate ability to\njust get to opponents back. So I was like, all right, I'm\ngood at getting to the back. Let me perfect controlling\nthe back and then submitting opponent via rear naked choke. And then besides that, I really\nfocus on leg lock defense, and then eventually came\nthe Rody lock pass where, you know, I'm really good at body lock passing my opponents now. And yeah, just takes a quite a long time, cause you have to find\ndifferent sequences, and then there's always these an abundance of opportunities\nthat your opponent gets from these specific sequences. So, takes a while. (Lex breathes deeply) - Is there part of you\nthat finds the fact that DDS split up heartbreaking? - I definitely, you know, having one person to go to that runs practice every day, that's, you know, consistent. It was definitely a gift. But now, I'm also gifted with\nmany, many other partners. I have Nicky Ryan, you know, Craig Jonesy. (laughter) - You just paused. Craig Jones. - Yeah, yeah. We have Ethan Crelinsten, Damien Anderson. So, a full team of knowledgeable athletes that I can continue to go\nto with multiple questions. But yeah, definitely, it took\nme some time to adjust to training or to learning from, you know, specifically my team\nand not just one person. - We should mention, for\npeople just listening, cause you can't visually see that Nicky Ryan is currently terrified. (light chuckling) And Craig Jones is currently enjoying the fact that Nick Ryan's there. But anyway, can you talk about your-- Nicky, can you talk\nabout your time with DDS? - I started training when\nI was like around 13. You know, my brother Gordon\nhad started prior to me. And, I really just went into training just as like a means to\nexercise and lose weight at the beginning, cause I\nwas pretty fat as a kid. So, I went to the first class, loved it. And then just started training every day at Gary's Gym Brunswick. And then, during the summer\nwhen I'd get off from school, they would take me up to New\nYork to train under John. And, you know, I just absolutely loved it. I knew what I wanted to do\nwith my life at a young age. So, I ended up dropping\noutta school actually, after my freshman year in high school. So yeah, 15 I ended up dropping out and just pursuing jiu-jitsu full-time. You know, training every\nday up in the blue basement. - Like what aspects of jiu-jitsu made you know that this is the thing for you? - It was just something I\njust enjoyed being, you know, like on the mats every day. I love that there's, you know, a problem solving aspect to it. So it's, you know, it's\nmentally challenging, it's physically challenging,\nhelps me get in shape. So, I just, yeah, right off the bat, I knew I loved it. - Okay, so then we'll go to the jungle. What happened in the jungle? (chuckles)\n- Yeah. - And in general, like... (chuckling) I like this, I like this\nlike shroud of mystery that shall never be penetrated. That should never be like-- - We've got a book deal. It's coming. - Book deal?\n- Yeah. - All right. - Obviously he left high\nschool, he's not writing it. - Okay. I'll do the Russian translation. (laughter) Okay. So, what are, what are things that you\nenjoy that you remember from working with John Danaher? - Yeah, I mean, you know,\nobviously he's considered one of the best coaches in the world. You know, very charismatic guy\nwhen you see him in person. You know, I pretty much was, you know, kind of raised in the DDS. You know, that's where I spent the majority of my time every day. So, I obviously had very\ndeep connections, you know, with John, my brother, Gary, you know, even Eddie\nCummings and stuff back then. So obviously, I miss interacting\nwith those guys every day. And you know, it's like they said, it's good to have somebody to kinda crack the whip at you every day. And John was very good at that. - When you're like younger\nin your teenage years, you can kind of, you like\nhave to get humbled, right? There's like a process to that. - Yeah, for sure. And... - That's a pretty good room\nto get humbled in, I guess. - Yeah, exactly. I mean, I was, I started training with them just when like everybody\nstarted to break out. Gary was like the\nbiggest name at the time, just cause he had won ADCC trials already, and he had a crazy match with Kron, at Kron Gracie at ADCC. But Eddie was just starting to break out. Gordon just started winning EBI. So, I started training\nunder John, you know, right when everything was exploding. - What are the good things about life, about jiu-jitsu you\nlearned from your brother? - Both me and my brother never\nreally wanted to, you know, work a full-time job doing\nsomething that we hate. And he was always, you know,\na very confident person. So he just went, you know, fully started pursuing jiu-jitsu. So, I'm very happy that, you know, he did that and I ended up\nfollowing in his footsteps because you can ask these guys, I'm a lazy sack of shit\noutside of the mat. So, that's definitely one thing\nthat I'm very grateful for. - That he paved the way, like, you can make money\ndoing stuff you love. - Yeah, exactly. And he was a big reason, you know, why my parents eventually\nlet me drop outta school. Because, you know, when\nthey were coming up, there was no money in the sport. It was very hard to make a full living. Like, if you wanted to\nactually make a living, you'd eventually have to transfer to MMA. And I feel like Gordon and\nGary and those guys were, you know, some of the first people to make a very good living\noff of just jiu-jitsu. - Does part of you find it heartbreaking that you've split up from DDS, but also from your brother in terms of spending time in the mat every day? - Yeah, for sure, you\nknow, I mean, growing up, you know, obviously he's my big brother. I looked up to him a lot. So I definitely, like I said, I miss interacting with those guys. I was pretty much raised, you\nknow, in that blue basement, you know, that John was like, you know, a father figure to me. So I definitely, you know, miss seeing those guys every day. - Do you have animosity towards Gordon? And does he have animosity toward you? And what is the source of that? And do you think you'll ever\nbe able to forgive each other? - Definitely initially,\nduring the initial split, we definitely hated each\nother at the beginning. But it's definitely started to calm down. Actually, just prior to, you know, all this social media drama\nthat's going on currently. (laughter) He had reached out to me and\nthat was literally like the first time that we have actually talked since the split happened. So, we didn't talk to each other for, what is it now like, almost two years? And that was the first\ntime that, you know, we interacted again. And overall, you know, he wasn't, you know, aggressive towards me. I wasn't aggressive towards him. We were cracking some jokes. So, hopefully the animosity is going down. - Well, there's this godfather\nquote that I wrote down, I recently re-watched it. From the Don, from Don\nCorleone, Vito Corleone. \"The strength of a family, like the strength of an army lies in its loyalty to each other.\" Is there some aspect\nof family that you miss of the blood that kind of connects you, that you can count on? - Yeah, my parents, you know,\nthey both raised us that, you know, like family is everything. You never, you know, betray your family or anything like that. So I definitely, you know,\nmiss him from time to time. - Okay. Imagine you're like 40 years from now, sitting on a porch with a\nshotgun drinking whiskey, looking over like all the\nland you've conquered. Looking back to this moment, is the reason you split\nup a bullshit reason? Or is it a good reason? From the perspective of the\nking who has now conquered the lands, have proven himself,\nhave done everything. - I think it was definitely\nlike a justifiable reason for the team splitting. Like it just, with the way things were going, it just was not gonna work with, you know, all of us in the same room together. It started, you know, affecting training. People didn't feel comfortable in things. So, I definitely think that it was a justifiable reason to split. - The things that happened in the jungle. (Nick Ryan chuckles)\n- Yeah. - To be told about in the book. Is it gonna be an audio book\nor is it just gonna be... And who's gonna voice it? - Might be a play. (laughter) - A musical?\n- Yeah, a musical. - On Broadway. How's your singing voice? - Mine's not so good, but\nNicky has a beautiful voice. - Does he? Of an angel? I bet. Okay. Speaking of the social media drama, I should mention that\nI've talked to recently to Gordon, a bunch. I've talked to him about\ntalking to you guys. And he's had nothing but\nreally nice things to say about you, Nicky Ryan. And he has had nothing but bad things... (giggles softly) - What was some of the things? - Um...\n(chuckles) (laughter) There's... Well, let's just go to\nthe social media first. (chuckling) Cause the social media\nstuff that he said publicly is just like, a warmup. It's like foreplay, I guess. So, Gordon sent you, Nicky Rod, flowers for Valentine's Day. A posting on Instagram, quote, \"I've been fucking him in\nevery round in competition since we met in 2018. The least I can do is buy him flowers.\" - We didn't get the flowers. - No, so... Yeah, that was the question. Did you get the flowers? You never got the flowers. - He sent it to the wrong address. - [Lex] He did?\n- Yeah. - Where do you think he sent it? - It was close, but it was wrong. - Did you appreciate the romantic gesture? - I did. I was looking forward to\nthe flowers and potentially chocolates in there, but you know, it was a bit of a letdown. - Can you describe your\nrecent match against Gordon? The EBI match. - Okay so, EBI match on UFC Fight Pass was a 20 minute match.\n(breathes heavily) And, immediately, you know match starts, I pulled guard and then I stand up, he pulls guard and we have this\nkind of like back and forth where he is trying to dig for underhooks, trying to get on top of me and\nhe can't really find success. And in the midst of me trying\nto work my body lock pass, Gordon's able to underhook\na leg and we end up in a leg entanglement. And then I'm able to transfer\nthat leg entanglement to a 50/50 position, still\nin the leg entanglement. From that 50/50 position, I'm\nable to separate his feet, and actually get a few\npops and he actually said I broke his foot in that exchange. - With a toe hold.\n- With a toe hold, yep. And you know, after that, we had a a bit more. I was just being working on top positions trying to get my body lock. Time runs out and we go to overtime. In overtime-- - Can you hold on a second, actually? - Yep. - What does it mean to break a leg? What does-- I was very confused about, - Okay, so-- - Is this like a expression\nor what do you mean? What do you mean broke? Which part breaks in a toe hold? - Okay, so in a toe hold there's a few different grades of it. Like you could get a\nfew pops and have some, you know, walking issues. And people consider that a break. And then you could break it\nfully and have your foot be like a limp noodle, you know? I think what are those? Achilles? Is it was the front of\nthe Achilles or something? - I mean, probably the ligaments. I mean it's funny like,\na lot of people say they broke something. But like to me, you break\nbones, you tear ligaments. So I would imagine, you\nprobably had a grade three tear. - Grade three. - How hard do you think is it to, I always wondered that with\nlike a straight foot lock, how hard is it to break the shin, or like the actual bones\nversus the tear stuff? - Depends how many steroids they're on. And obviously how much you're on. - You're one of the few guys\nthat have actually broken bones in competition. - Uh, yeah, have I? - [Nicky Rod] Oh yeah, many.\n- A couple, yeah. - Which bone did you break? - Spiral fracture of the fibula. - Hmm. - Very specific. - [Nicky Rod] A lot of power out there. - Was it a twisting? How did you break it? - Oh, it was a heel hook. Vinny always used to say\nheel hooks don't work, leg locks don't work. But unfortunately, age\ngets the best of all of us. I think he had some\nmileage on those ligaments. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And the bone, I guess. - So it's actually what? The bone... - Yeah, his ankle like disconnected from the tibia and the fibula. But the fibula definitely\nsnaps pretty bad there. - That's fascinating. The dynamics of that. Okay. Anyway, it went into overtime. What happened in overtime? - Okay, what happened in overtime? Let's see, trying to hang. Oh, okay. I go with defense first. Whistle blows, I'm able to escape in like 17 seconds. And then immediately\nafter, I go on his back, and he gets out in exactly 17 seconds. I'm like, shit, all right. I thought I had a good start. And then he gets on my\nback right after that, and he's able to ride me out for pretty much the entire round. After that, I got back on his back, he escapes in maybe like\na minute and some change. I think where I went\nwrong in the overtime is I should've been less adamant\nabout chasing the submission, and more aware of collecting time. If I kind of diverted my\nattention towards acquiring, you know, time on the\nclock, it would've been, you know, more of my favor. But yeah, at the end of my overtime round I'm able to lock up rear\nnaked choke over the face, but there just wasn't\nenough time to fully finish. You know, I got a few\nseconds of squeeze in there. I didn't have enough time to adjust and. Go ahead. - Do you think if you were on steroids you would've finished the choke? - I mean, for sure, for sure. - That's what I thought too. - If you're on gear, it you're, you're changing the biology\nof your body, right? You're adjusting your DNA. For sure, if I adjusted my DNA, I mean, - Yeah.\n- It's a finish. - So, you're implying\nyou're a natural athlete, is what you're saying? - Oh, I'm definitely a natural athlete. Yeah. Heavy immolation. (laughter) - Okay. So, for people who don't\nknow the EBI rules, it's an interesting rule\nstructure where the overtime, you put yourself in like\nthe worst possible position. And the task is to escape, and then the other person\ngets the same thing. What do you guys think\nabout that rule set? - I like it just because... First of all, I don't like the idea of having to put somebody on my back, but I do like the definitive\nanswer in the match. Like, either you escaped in time or you got, you know, written out. So the absolutely, like you have a, you get to the final winner. That's great. I'd much rather have that\nthan a close decision and it kind of goes the other way. - What about you? - I mean honestly, there's\nall the different roles. When I look at the role sets, I just try to think of what role set I could beat that individual in. And I sort of gear myself towards that. That's really the strategy there. I think there's some guys that like, that stall a lot, that you would love to have\nEBI overtime with at the end. You know, they're stalling until they have to give us a good position. But then there's some guys\nthat are so good in those positions I'm like, ooh, maybe\nwe just do a regular match, you know? - What are the rules in the streets? - The streets? No time limit. - Yeah, that's one of it. There's also like concrete\nand cars and stuff. - Concrete, biting. - Biting, yeah. Poking. Yeah. So, you don't like that rule set? Are there some people you\nwould prefer in the street as a rule set? - Me? Probably not. (laughter) I don't know though. EBI, I mean, it's tricky, you know? It depends on the opponent,\nwhich rule set I'd wanna do. - What about you Nicky Ryan, what do you think about\nthe rule set of EBI? Yeah, so I think EBI is\nvery good from a spectator point of view. You know, people find it\nvery entertaining to watch. You know, cause people\nwanna see submissions and you're putting people,\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Yqou're putting the athletes\nin a position where you know, you have like the highest percentage submission in the sport. So obviously, you're gonna\nget a lot of submissions. My issue with it is, it is a\nrule set that allows somebody that's overall worse at\njiu-jitsu to win a match. You know, a guy can go\nout there and just stall and just get completely dominated for the entirety of regulation, and then he gets to\nstart on the guy's back. So, that's my one issue with it. - But also, I mean isn't\nit interesting to see, like the best people in\nthe world have to be put in a really bad position? And to see how good their\nescapes are, for example. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah, I think-- - It's interesting.\n- [Nicky Ryan] Yeah. - But it doesn't feel like, realistic. It's a fun thing to watch, but it doesn't feel like the real fight. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah. - It feels weird. - I'll claim it, if I start an overtime on\nsomeone and finish 'em, I'll claim it. But if they submit me an\novertime I'm like, ahh. - You're gonna deny it. - It's not a real submission. - Good. (Lex chuckles) - The issue is people like stalling to just win the overtime. - Yeah. - So, where you got this guy, his whole training camp is just, not get subbed and win the overtime. It's a bit boring. - By the way, I have a a rose behind you. Somebody gave me a Valentine's flower. So, if you miss the one from\nGordon, I got one for you. - Well, I'd appreciate that. Thank you. (laughter) It's good to feel loved. - Yeah. All right. (chuckling) So, what did you learn from that match? Like, a takeaway as technically speaking? Like, what do you need to work on? - Well, I learnt that I\nam pretty good, and uh... (laughter) Yeah, pretty good. I got a, you know, a few-- I know exactly what my weakness is. You know, it's the leg lock department. And I'm doing a lot to, you know, get better in that specific aspect. - Attack in defense. - I would say, yeah. But attack, defense, re-attacks, even if I wanted to\noffensively enter a leg, you know, I could use\nsome work there as well. But I feel like once I solidify like my, like if I become a black belt specifically in the leg lock department, I feel like I'd be unstoppable. - If you, Nicky Rod,\ndefinitively beat Gordon Ryan, how would you do it? - Buggy choke. - Buggy Choke. - Buggy choke. For the listener, (soft laughter) I don't even know how\nto describe buggy choke. What's the definitive like,\nconclusion on that choke? Does it work? It's a choke that you do when you're in a, what's the opposite of a dominant, it's not submissive in\na non-dominant position of bottom of sight control. - Yeah. Just embarrassing submission\nto get caught with, really? - Yeah. But, does it work? - It works on certain people. (Nicky Ryan giggles softly) - For the listener, he\nglanced over at Nicky Ryan. It's embarrassing but it's also what? It's a way to frustrate the opponent. - For sure, yeah. It's a new part of the sport. I feel like the Ruotolo's\nbrought it back into fashion. And even if you don't get it, because it's one of those\nmoves that's so embarrassing, at the first sign of danger, the top guy abandoned ship. And you can basically retain God by attempting a very\nembarrassing submission. - So, the threat of embarrassment. - [Craig] Yeah.\n- To everybody. - People pull out very quick to avoid suffering the consequences. - I think some people underestimate how good of a submission it is. I mean like once you're locked in there, there's not too many\ndefenses for a buggy choke. - Are you... Is there an instruction on\nthe way from you on the-- - Jay Rod, actually, your\nlittle brother has one. - Oh yeah? For real? You actually legit have.. Oh, wow. (laughter) That's awesome. We'll check it out. So I mean, there is, I mean,\nyou're making a joke out of it, but it is real, like,\nthere's a system to it. - I mean, yeah. I don't know if we'd call it a system. (laughter) It's a good move. - I mean, you take an\nopponent that was just winning in a greatly dominant\nposition and then boom, in that same position, they're\npretty much, they're losing. You know, it's an interesting move. - What's the name of the, what's the name of it? - [Male] It's called, The\nBuggypedia by Jay Rodriguez. - Okay. The Buggypedia. I thought there'd be something like, very Craig Jonesy about it. Okay, awesome. I know you don't want to\nsort of reveal the secrets of what you're working on. But in general, what does it take to beat Gordon? I guess, is the question.\n- Okay. So, it would've to be\nsome kind of a choke. I think any joint lock\nor anything like that, he's just gonna let it\nbreak and stay in the match. So, I don't even think he'd tap from like, a rear naked choke. I think I would have to put him to sleep. So, putting him to sleep is how I'd win. - So, Gordon is somebody\nwho really hates losing. - Yeah, like he won't even\ntap in the practice room. I remember like, I had a\ntoe hold a couple times in practice room, and\nhe was just comfortable like, working there. I'm like, I'm not really\nputting much on it. I think he just, you know, maybe because of situations\nlike that in practice, he kind of didn't respect\nmy toe hold's ability in competition. - You've done that to me in the practice. - I have, yeah.\n(Craig chuckles loudly) Yeah. I gave you a little, you know? - Gave me a little pop and then he let go. (chuckles) - That was only 10% right there. Imagine--\n(laughs) - [Craig] Hey, don't get into math. - [Nicky Rod] Ha ha! - [Lex] Okay. Is there some part of that\nyou think is necessary to be a champion as to like, this almost unwillingness\nin competition to tap? - I think there's definitely\nsomething to be said for people that are just like, you know, willing to go that extra mile, or to take that damage\nto secure their victory. - Is there part of you that like, would hate to tap or hate to tap? - Yeah. I mean, all of me would hate that. (laughter) Yeah. The whole part of me. - Isn't there a John\nLegend song like that? All of you and all of me? - Very romantic, yeah. - Yeah. Now, we're sticking on that theme. Okay, I'm sorry. (soft laughter) Oh, one of the things Gordon asked, - Uh oh. - I forget how you put it\nbecause I think there's a lot of words that would need\nto be censored involved. But he said, \"Ask them how it feels to have a zero five record against me with four submissions combined.\" - I mean, first of all, I wasn't sure he could count to five. - [Lex] Yeah. - That's an impressive thing. - [Lex] That's impressive. (Lex chuckling)\n- Oh and five. I mean, I will say one thing, nobody beats me four times. (soft laughter) - I love you so much, Craig. - I did have a question. I did have a question for you. There was some controversy\non your Twitter. - [Lex] Yeah. - About a list of books. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I was wondering why Gordon's book wasn't\nfeatured amongst that literature? - Well, it was only the first 30 books or like the first 20 books. And it would of course be in the-- - Something interesting about Gordon, he's the first author that's written more books than he's read. - Pretty good. (laughter) If you face him and beat him, what's your take on what\nit takes to beat Gordon? I mean, you guys are kind of joking, they go pretty hard\nrecently on each other. But as a fan of jiu-jitsu,\nI'm all in on this rivalry. It's just fun to watch. - I mean, first of all, I don't think I go really hard with him. I think Gordon is, he's pretty sensitive,\nyou know what I mean? He's looking for a large\ninsult in a small insult. And for me, like Australians, we just attack each\nother, all day, every day. And for me, like if I see someone that\ntakes himself very seriously, that's like blood in the water. That's funny to me. To me, if I can just gently provoke and get a strong reaction, that's hilarious. Like Aussies, we'll just attack each other, and the first person that gets upset, he kind of loses the exchange. So, I think that is\nvery, very entertaining. - Like if you were to beat Gordon, would the mental game off\nthe map be part of it? - I think it would be a factor for sure. But I mean, I'm never gonna come out too crazy direct with him. You know? Like I don't, I can't, I find that like if you\nget too upset online and you're going crazy, I find that-- I'd be embarrassed to do that myself. Obviously, everyone's different. Everyone has a different style, you know? But like, yeah, I think mental, the mental aspect would play a big factor. I mean, mainly because\nif I were to beat him, I would send him a message\nevery day until I died. - [Lex] Yeah. - Just to gently remind him\nthat I got the last one. The last one. It's all that matters. We're not keeping score here.\n- Win it back. - Yeah, we're not keeping score. - So like, once you beat him, you're going to run for\nthe rest of your life. - I mean run, but look back. - Yeah.\n- You know? Look back and laugh. - Run with messages or something. - A sidestep. - Ride your horse to into the sunset. Okay. Well by the way, you've\ntalked very lightly. You've talked shit very lightly against Alexander Volkanovski's\nopponent, very lightly. Have you received death threats or, how are you still alive? - Like Gordon, I would say people from\nDagastan take a joke very well. You know what I mean? - Do they really? Do they really?\n- No. (laughter) - Oh, I was waitin' for you. Oh, sorry. I'm slow. I'm way too aggressive mode in my head. - Now honestly,\n- [Lex] Half listening to you. - Islam is pretty cool. I wanted to stir it up a bit, you know? Cause like I felt like\nthat was a massive fight and it probably should\nhave added more attention than it was receiving. So, I wanted to just\ngently stir it up a bit. I feel like Sambo guys\nare in the same lane as catch wrestlers. Very sensitive. You know, like obviously,\nthere's only three people in the world that do catch wrestling. Sambo, maybe 10 to 15. So, I figured we could really\nprovoke them with that sort of jiu-jitsu sambo stuff. Islams took the jokes very well. The Russian fans not so much. They're very serious. There's not many smiles\nin Russia, you know? They didn't take it as well. - I'm trying to suppress the anger. The rage is building inside me, slowly. So, you guys mentioned steroids. - I like that you bring that\nup after we talk about Russia. For the record. Smooth, smooth segue there. - I did not condone the\nstatements said by the Aussie. But, I would love to\ntravel with you to Russia. - That would be a good time.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - You might get killed with me, now. - No, I would be like the\nfirst to turn to backstab you. (laughter) - Like I got him. - All right. Are most of the top grapplers on steroids? - I mean, it's hard to say. You know, some people look like shit and they're on steroids. Some people look excellent\nand they're not on steroids. It's so, so hard to tell. - But that seems to be\nthe general consensus, that a lot of people on steroids. I'm always a little bit, I don't know, so I'll be honest, I've never\nseen anyone take steroids. I've never taken steroids. I don't even know if that's\nthe right term to use or like TRT, any of that. So, I'm very careful like,\nto not let my naivete like, lead me to take conclusions. But, I do feel a little bit\nweird about the witch hunt nature of it. That some people a little\nbit too eagerly claim that others are on steroids just\nbecause they're successful. But at the same time, it does\nseem that a lot of athletes will do whatever it\ntakes to be successful. - Yeah, I mean if a sport doesn't test, you gotta assume most\npeople are gonna do it. And especially now, as more\nmoney comes into the sport, you gotta assume more people\nare gonna do it, you know? - But generally, like, do ADCC and like, does jiu-jitsu test? - [Craig] It's actually encouraged. - What's encouraged?\n- No, I'm kidding. - You get a pamphlet. Okay. They don't test? There's no testing? - They test to make sure we're on steroids cause obviously it's a big show for the UFC five plus in the future. (laughter) You don't want anyone\ncoming in outta shape. - [Lex] Very nice. Do you think using steroids\nin that kind of context in sports is wrong? Like stepping away if it's not illegal? - [Craig] I mean, from my perspective. - Do you think ethically speaking? - I like to assume everyone's on steroids so I have to feel bad about\nusing steroids myself. - Yeah.\n(soft laughter) Do you use all of the steroids? - I'm over 30. It's TRT, you know, that's\nthe medical definition. (giggling) - That's the medical def-- Okay. I'd like to meet your doctor. - [Craig] Therapeutic use, you know. - Therapeutic, right. Like, how do you just feel about it? - I mean, it is cheating for sure, whether they test for it or\nnot, I think it is cheating. Obviously some people are gonna say, \"Oh fuck it, everyone's on it. I should be able to get away with it.\" Makes it even playing field. You know? But it kind of becomes Russian\nroulette cause it's like, if one guy's taking a small amount, and the other guy is taking a huge amount, he's gonna reap huge\nrewards in the short term. Probably be dead, pretty early. But die a champion, mind you. You know what I mean? So it's like, I don't know where line is yet. - Yeah. What do you think about that? Do you think it's worthy\nto take health risks just for the glory? - I think if you're 40, about to die, looking at a cabinet of gold\nmedals for wrestling other men, it's probably not gonna hit\nthe same way on your death bed. You know? - What? Sorry. In which direction? Like, is that a good thing or not? - No. You're probably gonna feel like, \"Oh fuck, I probably wasted\na bit of health on that.\" You know?\n- You think so? Isn't that like the glory of it? Like you said, other men? Yeah. (Craig chuckles)\n(soft laughter) Yeah, yeah. - Well, I mean, in my opinion, I'll maybe rest of a woman as well, but. - What'd you do with\nGabby on Valentine's Day? Where did you take her? What'd you guys-- - We filmed some new stuff for Only Fans. - [Lex] For Only Fans. - [Craig] We never stop working. - So, the love affair\nis also a work affair. Okay. I don't know. There's something too that made like... Like Olympic gold medalist\naccomplishing like the heights sacrificing everything. Just everything. The first 20, 30 years of your life for this silly little piece of metal. I don't-- I think there's something\nbeautiful to that. That like, conspires a\nlot, a lot of people. And that's like the height of\nthe human condition in a way. - What did you survive? I'm just saying if you're in\nyour death bed early in life. - We all die. All men die, Craig Jones.\n(Craig chuckles loudly) But, not all men truly live. - How many years are\nyou willing to shave off for a gold medal? - That's a good question. How many? How many are you willing to\nshave off for a gold medal? What year for silver medal? - For silver. I mean for a silver medal,\nI'd shave a few off. - I think two silvers makes a gold, so. (laughter) - It's worth five years. - Five to ten maybe, yeah. Shave off the bad years and\nhaunts the good ones, you know? - Well, I mean, you've sacrificed, you guys sacrificed a\nlot, a lot of your life. You continue to sacrifice. Or you don't see it as sacrifice? - It's fun. I think training's fun,\nbeing bit adamant about it. Consistent. I mean, I think we have a\ngreat routine, great ritual. Definitely enjoy the process. - All right. Well, do you guys know, this is bro science. Or I'm talking bro scientist, but do you know how long\nsteroids stay in your system? - Forever? - Forever. Oh, because it's like-- - Hey, once you do it, y'all want it. (laughter)\n- Yeah. Just the knowledge. Yeah. All right. - I think it's different\nfor each steroid, right? I think some of 'em\nlast longer than others. It depends if it's a year. - You would think I would do\na little research before this, asking these questions. Why do you think most athletes and coaches don't talk about steroids? Like, why is it such a, like a secret? Why is it so embarrassing? - I think they probably\ntalk about it like, amongst the team and whatnot. Again, I mean, it's gonna be\nmore shady if it's like a, your sport is tested or not. We're kind of in the Wild West, in the grappling world, you know? - Yeah. But why don't grapplers talk about it? Because the team's cheating. - I mean, it's kind of\ninsinuated as a bit of cheating. Even if it's not, like, if it's not tested, I mean, still, you're taking a\nperson that could, you know, maybe has good jiu-jitsu, good mechanics, you're putting 'em on the leg\nand they're subbing you with a heel hook versus breaking\nyour leg with a heel hook. You know, something as\nsubtle as that can make, you know, big differences. - All right. This is gonna make me sound dumb, but is it possible that steroids are not a huge help in grappling? - I think if you're bad at\njiu-jitsu and you do steroids, you're gonna continue\nto be bad as jiu-jitsu. But if you're great at gear, I'm sorry, if you're great at grappling, (laughter) If you're great at grappling\nand then you also do gear, it's gonna enhance what\nyou're already, you know, good at and make you much better. - But like how much is the enhancement? I guess is the question? - How much is muscle valued? - Right.\n- Like if you're, - That's the question. - If you're doing gear and you're not changing weight that much, like maybe it helps you a little bit. But if you know, you're gaining\n50, 60 pounds of pure muscle and it's like, that's a huge enhancement. That's another human. - Does muscle-- A small human, yeah. Does muscle matter in jiu-jitsu? I guess is the question. Is it possible that it gets in the way? - I'd say muscle matters,\nbut technique matters more. - I also think that it'll help you develop technique as well. Because obviously, you know, testosterone\nhelps with recovery rate. So if you're on gear, you're\nable to train a lot more. Now with that being said,\nif you're not able to learn, obviously it's not gonna\nhelp in that aspect. But, if you're somebody\nthat knows how to learn and get good at jiu-jitsu, and then you add gear on top of that, you're able to do\nsignificantly more sessions throughout the week. - Okay. And by the way, gear is steroids? - [Nicky Ryan] Steroids, yeah. - Okay. - I also think that you don't\nhave to be as consistent in like your sleep, in\nyour food and stuff, if you're on gear. You have a little bit of leeway. But I mean, being consistent\nin your diet and your sleep definitely would help,\nyou know, the process. - Since you use most steroids, - Most steroids, yep. - of any athlete I've ever met, do you think steroids help jiu-jitsu? Oh man. - I think obviously it helps recovery and your ability to train more. But I think some, I've seen some guys go on steroids and then suddenly they feel\nlike the incredible Hulk and now in the training room, they start to rely more on strength, - [Lex] Yeah. - than the techniques they had. And it actually in some respect, hinders them, and makes\n'em gas more in competition cause then they're\nusing more of the muscle they never used to have. - So, you've implied that\nyou're a natural athlete. - Mmhm. - [Craig] You said that, you said that skeptically. (laughter) Why are you skeptical Lex? (laugher) - Is this something you\ndo for social media, to talk shit to Gordon, to imply that he's not a natural athlete? - Well, I only pretty much\nrecently on social media I had this rebuttal, you know? Saying that, you know, Gordon's on gear. And I only said that\nbecause after our match in our most recent match. You know, the EBI rules match, he accused me of greasing,\nwhich is like lubing up. So, I'm slippery during our match, so. - And you and you did not? - I did not. I was checked multiple\ntimes before and after our grappling event. And he still, you know, went\nout and accused me of this. So, I was like, all right, as opposed to telling a lie,\nI'll just tell the truth about, you know, your steroid use. Which it shouldn't be that\nbig of a deal in retrospect cause he kind of admitted it and whatnot, you know, previously. So, it's yeah, I just kind of felt\nlike I had to rebuttal. And I didn't do it immediately\ncause I was like, all right. I know I have this podcast\nplanned so I'll wait to do it on, you know, my friend, Mark Bell's podcast. You know, could be a little more, get a little bit more exposure on it. - Sure. - And yeah, I knew he\nwas gonna bite the bait. But I didn't think he was gonna, you know, bite the bait that hard. I know he's a little stressed\nout about the comment, but, you know. - And that was the origin of you guys going back and forth on, - Well it wasn't so much\nback and forth, it was just, I went forth and then he\nkept going back, back, back. Like, I remember one of my guys\nDM'd me and they were like, \"Gordon's made like 68 Instagram stories, and 67 of them were all about you.\" I was like, all right, well\nI'm in his head for sure. - Got us a few followers. We appreciate that. - We did get followers. Even shouted out our\nB-Team White Belt Program. So, thank you.\n(chuckles) - Yeah. (chuckles) Okay. Speaking of which, what's the B-Team? How's it run? And why is it called the B team? - Well, I mean Craig named it. - Was the A-Team taken?\n(laughter) - I would've picked. For me, B is for best. - Okay. Best. All right. What does B stand for, for you? What does it represent? What is the ideal like the, you know, Miyamoto Musashi, philosophical\nfoundation of B-Team? - Aim low and achieve.\n- Hm. If the bar is set low,\nyou can't help but win. Okay. - That's Nicky's philosophy\nwith women as well. (Nicky laughs) Set the bar incredibly low. Overachieve. - So, what is the B-Team? How do you guys run it? Like what's, yeah, I mean can you just talk about\nthe school, how you found it? What is it? What's it like? - I mean, pretty much just\na regular jiu-jitsu gym. We started a as sort of a pros only purple belt and above team. And we have me, Nicky\nRod, Nicky Ryan, Ethan, Damien as coaches. Am I missing someone? - Oh, JB. - Your memory,\n- [Craig] JB. - with your old age. - Impeccable memory, yeah. And we got JB coming on\nto teach white belts. But just your stock\nstandard jiu-jitsu team. We focus on more, we lean heavily towards the professional athlete side of things. We have a lot of high level guys in there. - [Lex] Yeah. - Class structure, regular instruction and positional sparring open rounds. But we sort of took a\nheavy slant on marketing side of things. We really try to blow\nup the YouTube channel. Obviously, we sell a lot of\nclothing, merchandise and stuff. So yeah, we just sort of\ntook a modern approach to a standard jiu-jitsu\ngym because I mean, jiu-jitsu gyms are full\nof some of the most boring human beings on earth. So, we try to highlight. - Strong words, Craig Jones, strong words. - Highlight the other\nside of things, you know? Keep it pretty lighthearted. - [Lex] That it can be fun.\n- Yeah. That jiu-jitsu can be fun. I guess that it can be cool too. You know, it's not just\nfull of steroided up autistic people, you know? - Question from Reddit, quote, \"Need to hear some of the\nstories about drop-ins that led to the making\nof the gem of a video, 'The Dos and Don'ts of\nTraining a B-Team.'\" Any fun stories? - Any ones that stands out? Do you guys remember any? - Police involved ever? - We had a guy coming\nabout to kick him out. He was stalking two of the members. Yeah, well I mean, there's\njust crazy people, you know? Like, I portray a pretty\ninsane image online, and I guess I am that, a lot of the time But at training, try to\nkeep it, while training. Around training I'm insulting everyone. But while training, I try to keep it pretty serious. But obviously, the image\nof a Trey Lu is in some of the crazier members. - I mean like the thing is\nabout the gym you guys run is really professional. It's like friendly. It's like the lighthearted\njoking is there obviously. You know, like shit talk\nand all that kind of stuff. But like, it's a pretty safe environment. - [Craig] Yeah, cause-- - But the public persona\nmight attract some-- - Some maniacs.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I won't say which\nplaces I've trained at, but obviously there's some\nplaces you walk into the room and it's very, very serious.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - There's no smiles around. Obviously, it's pretty an\naverage training room in Russia, but no smiles. Very serious environment, you know what I mean?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And I definitely totally like that. I don't wanna show up to training and be walking on eggshells, not knowing what the\ncoaches' moods like that day. I wanna go in, have a good time. Keep it lighthearted. - What was in the video? What are the dos and don'ts? Because like the address is\npublic, like anyone can show up. - Anyone can show up. Yeah. What were the dos and don'ts? - Does anyone challenge you? Like, to a fight? - Not yet. Not yet. I mean, probably from other gyms in town, that's probably coming down the line. But, dos and don'ts-- - I'm all in on that. I would be excited as a fan to just watch. - [Craig] I love the drama. - Not the drama. No, no, no. Well, a little drama, a\nlittle drop of poison is good. But ultimately, it's the\nbest grapplers in the world kind of going at it, yeah. And it's fun. Because, maybe I'm wrong, but I think there is an\nunderlying deep camaraderie at the end of the day. When you're like at the top of the world. - [Craig] Yeah.\n- And you're like in the same town. - What could possibly go wrong? - It's like a shitty Western, but like an epic Western. Where like, Clint Eastwood with like, \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\". Of course I love it. I'm here just eating popcorn like that. - Stirring the pot. - I'm not stirring the pot.\n(laughter) I'm not staring the pot. - These questions are from\nReddit, but not from you. (laughter) - That one for sure. - Yeah. I mean, what could possibly go wrong if you are the world's best\ngrappler hates you and you are gently provoking him behind\nthe scenes every day? Well I mean,\n- For sure. In Texas. - And you've stolen his\nbrother, held him for ransom. - Kidnapped. It is like a story of a\nshitty Western, I think. You now allow white\nbelts to train with you. What's it like to open it\nup to a bigger audience? - We haven't opened it up yet, but it'll be interesting to see. I mean, I feel like your higher belts, they really understand\nwhat the training room is, you know what I mean? White belts early, they're trying to find\ntheir place in the gym, could be kind of awkward and\nstuff in that environment. So, I think obviously\nthose white belts coming in will change the dynamic. But the white belts will have\na separate white belt classes obviously for 'em. Cause given it's such a high level gym, it'd be tough a beginner\nto be able to enter the more advanced classes. Well obviously, we're teaching\nmore advanced techniques. So yeah, we've separated\na white belt program, I believe 6:00 PM,\n- Yeah. - Monday to Friday. Yeah, maybe we'll have\na Saturday one as well. But, it'll be interest to see how it goes. We're trying to do things\ndifferent, you know? Like, we're trying to do your traditional jiu-jitsu\ngyms, obviously you're not gonna teach beginners wrestling at all. We're trying to split it\nat least 33% top game, bottom game, and wrestling. So, at least create more\nwell-rounded athletes from day one. Whereas, I feel like most\ntraditional jiu-jitsu gyms might have No-Gi once a week. They don't touch wrestling\nvery IBJJF heavy techniques. But again, the sport's changing for sure. - Just to take that on. How does a beginner get good at jiu-jitsu? Like given that you're\nstarting this white belt, what's your philosophy on that? - Obviously buy all of my instructionals. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- At full price. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Not during a sale. - [Lex] Okay.\n- That would go a long way. - For those of you who are\nRussians, I'll give you, I'll send you instructions, or all the forms, so you\nknow how to steal it. - [Craig] Yeah, a discount card. - I bought 'em all so I'll\njust send it to you for free. - I mean, we do have the\nMakhachev 50 discount code, you know? - [Lex] Yeah. - Offering discounts to help\nhim out for the rematch. - Nice. (laughing)\nMakhachev discount. Well, I got a hundred\npercent discount for you if you need it. But, that aside, your instructional are both hilarious and brilliant. And it's one of the most respected\ninstructionals out there. - [Craig] Oh, thank you. - [Lex] With incredibly great names. - [Craig] Yeah, it probably\nloses me Silas honestly, if you're removing seriousness of the-- - [Lex] Oh, cause they think\nit's gonna kind of suck. It's gonna be some funny gimmicky thing? - [Craig] Or, I mean, some\npeople don't even know if it's a real product. (Lex laughs) That's a big hurdle I have to overcome. If they see it and they're\nlike, is that a real thing? That's a problem. But how does the white belt get good? I think they just, I mean\nyou just have to show up, just have to put in the effort, try to focus on using\ntechniques in training, rather than just fighting to the death. You know? Although, that is\nentertaining for us to watch, two white bells fight to the death. - [Lex] Yeah. But, what are the techniques\nyou should focus on? Like, what's the process,\nwhat does it mean to show up? Like, how much drilling,\nall that kind of stuff? Like, if you were to\noptimize the first six months of a beginner. There's a lot of people\nwho would listen to this and haven't tried, they've been curious. I have a lot of friends who haven't, who are like jiu-jitsu curious. They're constantly looking\nfor an excuse to start. - I think it's just gotta\nbe as simple as possible. You know? Like, we shouldn't be teaching\nmore advanced movements. I mean obviously, in the\ngrand scheme of things there's highly advanced techniques, and then there's slightly advanced. And I think, trying to teach those guys real specific positions, even like real specific types of guard, is just beyond them. I think the best way to learn\nis through problem solving. And I think if you show the\ntechnique before they've discovered that problem, the\nlearning is sort of held back. So, I like the idea of\nusing kids style games to show them a problem and\nthen use the techniques to fix the problems\nthey've just discovered. I think that's the best way to learn. - Can you give an example of a problem to show them before you\ngive them the techniques? Like, what are we talking about. - All right, so say you wanted to teach posture in wrestling. You could create a game where one guy, the game might be get to\na leg or get to two legs, control the leg. Like, super simple. But the rules, the constraint would be one guy is forced to keep upper posture\nand one guy is forced, well not forced, but he's allowed to keep a bent\nof the hips, lower posture. And obviously within that constraint, the guy with the better posture is going to have more success. He's gonna have a better posture to secure a leg or secure both legs, and therefore, you've\ndemonstrated the flaws of bad posture without\nhaving to explain it to 'em before they really tested that out. - Okay. And then the result of\nthat you would realize that the bent over posture is better. - Yeah, you have that Aha moment rather than just being having been spoken to. - You wrote Craig, \"I'm a big fan of\nconstraint based learning,\" I guess, was what you're talking about. \"I love presenting\nbeginners with a problem before the solution. Like here, attempt to hold side\ncontrol with no cues on how. Then I see how the guy got out and address issue by issue. Crossface and hemp control and so on. Okay, so what are some other examples? Like side control? - Yeah, that would be an\nexcellent one, side control. Like obviously, we say\noh you secure a crossface so they can't turn into you. Much easier to have them\ntry to hold someone down without explaining what a crossface is, and then use that technique\nto address the problem they've just encountered. So, I think you could do that with a lot of areas of jiu-jitsu. Like even more advanced, say 50/50, obviously a mirrored position where you both have access\nto each other's heels. Most people will stall\nout in that position and keep their feet crossed. I think a great constraint\nfor both of them, you can't cross your feet. Now, you have to learn how to slip the heel hook when they expose it, and how to safely re-attack of your own. So, the constraint is you\ncan't be too defensive in that position. And I think the rate\nof learning increases. - Why do you think the\nrate of learning increases? Like, why do you think that works? - Because you encounter more problems. Say in that situation, they're\ngonna get you heal a lot more in whatever period of time\nyou allocate the drill for than if the legs are crossed. I don't think the hard\npart's splitting the legs to get to the submission. I think the hard part's practicing control while they're trying to\nslip it at a later stage. And then obviously,\ntrying to slip your heel when you're in more danger. So, it makes you more\ncomfortable in that bad position, if you're used to doing it with open legs. - Yeah, I think that probably\nthat style of teaching forces people to focus on. Cause it's so easy to fall into\nfocusing and like memorizing a particular details of a technique without thinking like, why\nthe hell does this even work? - [Craig] Exactly, yeah.\n- And if you don't have that, you get to focus on like, from like, as cliche as it sounds, from first principles. Like, why the hell? How the hell do I get out of this? Like, why does this even work? Why does wrestling work? Why do you have a bent over posture? You get to like start to ask\nthose kinds of questions. Which is kind of interesting\ncause it's not obvious to me that bent over posture\nis the right posture for jiu-jitsu, right? I'm confused actually about that. I don't know. - [Craig] About the correct posture? - Yeah, for jiu-jitsu. Like, what's the right answer? - I think bent over posture's\nstill good for jiu-jitsu. - Even with the judo and all of that. Like, why are so many jiu-jitsu people, like at a high level,\nthe posture is higher up? - Well, I think wrestling posture is just a bit too low because\nit's not necessary, right? If wrestlers are like\nlow enough to the ground where your hands could touch the mat. But in jiu-jitsu, you know, it's kind of a mix between\nlike wrestling and like, judo or Greco-Roman wrestling. So, I think it's just a bit more lax, and it's bent over but it's not upright. And it's also not super low, you know? - Bit more room for error too, because obviously the jiu-jitsu guy's shot isn't gonna be as athletic\nor as quick as a wrestler, especially a wrestler who shoots. - So, it actually comes down to the fact that jiu-jitsu people just on average, even at the top level, are not good at shooting. - I think so, yeah. I think obviously, I mean, all the wrestlers\nin America and stuff, they're starting super early, super young. You know what I mean? By the time they get to\nthe same age we are really, in our sport and stuff, they've spent much longer\ndoing the actual sport than the average jiu-jitsu guy. - And then there's another\nlevel of wrestling of course, with the Soviet block, that was just unachievable for your kind. - Who knew an Australian rugby, - [Lex] Yeah. - A former rugby player. - Rugby, is that kind of\nlike American football, but much less money? Is that what that is? - Much less money. Much tougher, I would say. But, who knew that the cure to the Dagestani wrestling\nwere the Aussies? - Was the Aussies? Okay, let's go there. (laughter) Your friend, your training\npartner, Alexander Volkanovski, you helped him prepare\nfor the Islam Makhachev versus Volkanovski fight. Who do you think, first\nof all, won that fight? - That's a tricky one. - How is that the tricky question? - [Craig] I will say, when I was-- - Of all the shit talk you've been doing, how is that The tricky question? - When I was in the corner\ngoing into the fifth, I personally believed\nlive that Volkanovski probably needed a finish\nto take the victory. - But you have to think that way, right? In general? Or do you like legitimately, - It's a gray area cause\nthe judging, who knows? Plus I was like, wait, we're in Australia, where's this bias? You know?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - We've got some Australian judges here. - [Lex] Yeah. - I was really hoping we\nget a bit of bias on that. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Unfortunately, not. Hopefully, they lose their jobs. But, again yeah, it was a close one. I think sometimes you're\nblinded in the moment because again, everyone counted Volkanovski out. The crowd's behind him. So, everything he does is\ngonna get a huge cheer. You're bias towards the smaller guy. You're bias towards the underdog. So, you're sort of, whatever the underdog does has\na bigger impact in your mind. And sometimes that can bias\nas the fight goes along. But yeah, super, super close fight. I would really love\nthem to have a rematch. But obviously, that's gonna\nhold up both divisions. So, I don't know if\nthey'll be able to do it. - Do you think they'll do a rematch soon? I mean, that was an epic fight. I was listening to the\nfight companion during that. - They all thought-- - And so, they biased\nstrongly, the opinion. - Round two is the tricky one. - [Lex] Yeah. - Round two is the tricky one. - Anyway, I'd love to see\nthat like, run it back and do three, actually. There's an epic fight. What was the brief conversation you had with Islam Makhachev and his team? - I didn't know how he\nwould take the joke. Cause obviously Khabib\ntried to flying eagle kick Dillon Danis in the face. So, I wasn't sure how my humor would go. - [Lex] Yeah. But, I mean Dillon must have\nsaid some worse things to me. I was just playing around. I mean, you can't really\ntake anything I say serious. - [Lex] Yeah. - Come across like an idiot. But, so when he was coming up\nto me afterwards I was like, oh, I don't know what he's gonna say. And again he maybe he\nwould've been more upset if he had lost, but he had just received the judge's decision.\n- Yeah. - But he came up, I\nwent to shake his hand, he gave me a big hug and\nthen pretended to throw me. And then, I thought the\ninteraction was over, and then he circled back. So, that's why I was so awkward. I was like, oh, he's coming back. He wants to say, he wants something else. But he just said, why didn't you teach\nyour boy how to escape the body triangle? - Oh, wow. Interesting. What did you say to that? - I said well I mean,\nobviously, you've gotta learn how to finish a rear naked choke. - Is that what you said? - No, I didn't say that. (laughter) Just laughing, I was laughing. By the end of the day,\nthey ushered us out. They were like, \"Get out of here before the Aussie crowd attacks here.\" You know? - What do you think about\nthe body triangle position they were in? It seemed like for the first time, it seems almost like Welk was\ndominant in that position, which is kind of weird. - I mean damage is meant to Trump control. MMA judging damage is\nthe number one factor. - Do you think the judges saw that? What did they score that as? - I think they all scored\nfour towards Islam. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Three and five. Two of the judges scored towards Volks. One of the judges scored three for Islam. One of the-- It was 49-46 for one of them. And the other ones were 48-47. I think the... Again, the confusing round was round two. I don't think anyone scored\nthe body triangle round for Volks, which I wish they had. - Volkanovski was and is still\narguably, pound for pound, greatest fighter in the world. How long have you known him? - I don't know the first-- I met him before he was in the UFC, when I used to live in Melbourne. He came down to train at Absolute. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then we really\nconnected on Ultimate Fighter. One of his guys who was\ngonna bring to a fighter, Brad Riddell, pulled out last second. So, he called me when I was\nin Puerto Rico, and he's like, \"Do you want to coach on\ntough for five weeks?\" And like I said, Puerto\nRico was apocalypse now. I was like yeah, get me out of here. So, I jumped on that opportunity, and we were in Vegas five weeks together. Cause he was meant to fight Ortega. And then he got hit with Covid real bad. Got stuck in, I think he was in hospital\nfor maybe one to two weeks. And then before he flew back\nto Australia, they were like, all right, maybe we just do you guys as the Ultimate Fighter coaches. So, I jumped on board with that. And that's really when we've become close. - [Lex] Yeah. - Obviously, I was useful\nin the Ortega fight. Helped him get out of submissions. He fought then Korean\nzombie, Max Holloway. I basically just held\nthe bucket at that point in the corner. Couple striking fights And then again, yeah, we had\nto tackle the Islam problem. So, I did spend five\nto six weeks down there preparing for that. - How did you tackle the Islam problem? - How did I tack-- - Was you, somebody who\nbarely knows anything about wrestling, having to-- - Helps he doesn't take much, you know? - [Lex] Yeah. - Especially, wrestling wrestling. - Did the beard help or like, what? Like, in all seriousness, what were some of the key\nideas that you worked on with Volkanovski to prepare for it? - I had the help of Frank Hickman. Hickman was down there too, one of the Hickman\nbrother's wrestling coach. So, we were sort of like, problem solving and I mean basically, we were confident in Volk's\nfence wrestling, his cage work. He's super good on the cage, super like, under\nrespected in that position. And we knew that if you were able to take the scrambles to the cage, he would be effective against Islam. Cause again, Islam is background in Sambo\nof freestyle wrestling. But I mean, honestly, he's probably got the same\nexperience on the cage as Volks. Obviously, some of those wrestling skills will translate very well to the cage, but the cage is still somewhat\nof a gray area, an equalizer. And Volks, again, incredible\nability to stand up. Incredible defense on\nthe cage, which you saw. We worked on strategies to get up, and a ton of submission defense. Islam loves Kimuras, obviously\nrear naked from the back, arm bars, those are sort of-- And arm triangles dominant submissions. But again, the guys he\nsubmitted, not grapplers. Apart from Charles Oliveira. And again, Charles Oliveira\nwas basically knocked out at that point. So, I was still impressed\nwe submitted him. But again, I always told people this, they thought it was crazy. I was like, Charles Oliveira versus Islam at a grappling match. Oliveira is gonna win that match. - [Lex] Like submission grappling. - Submission grappling. Yeah. So, in pure, grappling is a skillset. I think Oliveira's a\nmore dangerous grappler. So, we didn't even come into\nit thinking Islam was this unstoppable boogeyman that\npeople make him out to be. So, we approached it from that, just focused on the techniques, ability to get back up,\nusing turtle to get back up. Using turtle to scoot to\nthe cage to get back up, and hand fighting from there. Keeping it pretty safe. But what makes Volks so special\nI think is his gas tank. Gas tank and his willpower. He's just unbreakable. The Dagestani guys, Khabib, Islam, they are good at submissions. But,\n- [Lex] Okay. - They break guys mentally. And they fatigue 'em, and then they take the\nsubmission that's offered. Oliveira is a guy that\ncan jump on submissions, and have an incredible technical ability to finish those submissions, whether you're fresh or you're tired. And then you combine\nthat with Volkanovski, who incredible willpower,\nnever gets tired, you're never gonna break him. And as you saw, he only\nattempted one submission, the whole fight. - Is that learned? Is that trained? Or are you just born with\nthat mental toughness? - It's a good question. I mean he's like an anomaly. Like, the entire fight\ncamp, not nervous at all. Supremely confident. The whole fight week,\ncompletely confident. He just has an attitude like, \"Oh, everyone cast me out? We'll see.\" You know what I mean? Islam, he's like, let's see. - [Lex] No doubt.\n- No doubt at all. Super relaxed up until\nabout five minutes before, and then he starts to amp himself up. He's like, \"You are not taking\nthis belt from my family\". He gets into that sort of mindset. - [Lex] He actually says that out loud? - You can't teach that survival he did in the Ortega fight, you know? - Have you guys ever been like\npushed to the limit like that or broken in a grappling match? - I'll do it in practice. Like I'll push myself to like, you know, \"I think I my pass\nout or die or something.\" Like, as far as like how\ntired you get, you know, cause like, in a match, you-- - You try not to ever get\nclose to that in a match. - Yeah, you try to, cause you know, it's\nimportant to understand where you're exhaustion point is. But yeah, if you have to push\nto that limit in a match, you're probably doing something wrong. You know? Like, you've seen in\nmatches where guys sprint the last like minute, they try to win the\nmatch in the last minute, and it's like, you\ndefinitely had some mistakes leading up to that if\nyou have to, you know, gotta go balls to the wall. - Okay. But has there been ever\ntimes in competition? Especially like early\non cause you're like, you wrestled pretty hard and\nwrestling is pretty exhausting. Like, not wrestling but you know, wrestling style kind of thing. Going against the best\npeople in the world. - Yeah, I mean I definitely, Again, I think in\npractice it's important to do that hard work. That way, competition is much easier. You know, I think if you\nred line in practice, and you really pushed\nthrough like death's door, then once you're in competition\nand you're working with, you know, you're being fresh in a comp, I mean, it's much better. - Have you ever been to that thing where Dan Gable talks about,\nalways wanting to be to a place where you can't get off the mat? Like, when you work so\nhard in the training room, you can't get off the mat. I think he says he's failed\nat that in his career. He was always able to at\nleast crawl off the mat. - Yeah, I definitely never\nlike actually died on the mat. I felt like I was gonna die, you know? (chuckling) - Sure, sure. What about you? Do you quit all the time? - I get a leg cramp,\nI'm like, you know what, you got me in mount. Let's do this again tomorrow. (giggling) - Dude, if I'm asking Craig for a roll, he's in the bathroom somewhere. (laughter) - Do you see the value\nof pushing yourself? Like, to that place where\nyou're knocking on death's door? - Yeah, but it within safety, you know? Cause obviously the most serious injuries occur when you're tired over\ntraining and stuff like that. So, I think like taking a page outta what those MMA fighters do, especially\nVolks with his training. Like, he's not necessarily\npushing crazy in each round, but he's doing extra\nconditioning, assault bike stuff, crazy workouts outside. And he does do some\ncrazy training workouts, but all safe, very safe. Like when he's redlining like\nthat in the training room, it's a very controlled, safe setting. I think to do that in jiu-jitsu against some of these lunatics out there that are trying to kill you, especially when you have\na name, can be dangerous. - So, your approach is just is, don't warm up and don't try too hard. (chuckling) - [Craig] No certainty, but yeah. - For safety.\nNo, for safety though. (Craig chuckles)\n- Yeah. Longevity, you know? - And talk about Russians. (laughter)\nI got it, I got it. I hear you. Oh, but you mentioned cage work. What's interesting to\nyou that you've learned over all this time about cage work? What's like, what's interesting about\nthe dynamics of that? Are you talking about\nboth like the control in the dominant position,\nbut also getting up from the bottom while\nyou're at the guest cage? All of that? - The added dimension of that cage, that wool being there changes\na lot of stuff, right? So, obviously in some ways, it's a much lower impact wrestling style because you can't be sprawled on. You can shoot, the cage\nis gonna block their feet, you're gonna be able to\nchase down their hips. It's just a completely different fight. And again, because of Islam's judo skills, that upper body controls\nyou see he's able to use against the cage. Like the inside trips, sort of the Uchi Mata\nstyle, Hirajoshi throws. So, obviously those skills do translate. But yeah, I think the\ncage is a great equalizer for a lot of things like\nathleticism and stuff. It takes away a huge speed\nadvantage aspect of the fight. - So, he's really good at standing up. Is there, I assume he learned all\nof that from you and your instructional, \"Just Stand Up.\" - I mean we were so confident. I was like, you know what? Why don't we put this thing\nout a month before the fight? - [Lex] Yeah. - Maybe the illegal download hasn't made its way to Russia yet. - [Lex] Yeah. But, it was their for him. - Can you explain to me, what's in the instructional\n\"Just Stand Up?\" Like, what are the ideas? - I mean, the old school way to stand up people talk about the technical get up, you know the old Gracie, put the hand, but I mean, that doesn't work. It hasn't worked for 20 years, you know? If you look at everyone\nthat gets up at MMA, they're using turtle to get up, they're using wrestling to\nget up, you know what I mean? - [Lex] Yeah. - Which is counter to\nwhat pure jiu-jitsu says. They say don't expose the back,\ndon't ever expose your back. I think jiu-jitsu's a terrible\nway to get back to the feet because if you were to retain guard and go half guard or closed guard, super hard positions to get up, you're basically putting yourself in a leg tuck for wrestling. So, I think you need to\nborrow from wrestling to learn how to get up in an MMA fight. So, basically how to\nsafely expose your own back while not allowing them\nto get hooks and use that to get back up or at least not\nallow them to get two hooks. - And that applies for MMA especially? - For MMA especially, because obviously striking is a factor. But if they are striking, they don't have locked\nhands around your body, means you are able to move. You are able to make an\nattempt to get back up. They have to choose between\ncontrol, submission, or strikes. - Post from Reddit. \"Why does Craig Jones push so hard for a bottom is bad jiu-jitsu? What is so bad about playing bottom guards such as half guard or De La Riva?\" (chuckles softly) Those are the two options. - No one likes the bottom. - Why would I want to get up? Is the question for all of you. Is the bottom a bad place to be? - I mean, the bottom's bad\nif you don't want that guy on top of you. That's the way I look at it. You know? - Yeah. That sounds like something\na cowboy would say. But I don't know if that has much meaning. (light chuckling) I think the point of jiu-jitsu\nis both are dangerous, being on bottom and on top. - I think the longer the matches, probably favors the top guy more, just cause every movement\nthe bottom guy makes is probably carrying your weight, carrying that gravity on top of you. So, I think it's a bit more\nefficient passing from the top as opposed to sweeping from bottom. - Bottom's reactive, top is active. The top player decides how to engage, how to approach the guy. They can use angles,\nthey can use footwork, they can throw people, throw the legs by. So, it's an active position. Bottom's reactive. Reactive, you're gonna get fatigued. - Yeah, I think it's very\ndifficult to gas somebody out while playing guard. But I think it's very\neasy to gas somebody out when attempting to pass it. - Well, you guys are talking\nabout gassing people out, but is there more dangers from the bottom? Like, in terms of submissions and all that kind of stuff or no? - I'm back and forth\ncause I'm a top player, but I understand the\nvalue of being on bottom. Like when I do play guard, the bottom, I feel like the submissions\ncome much easier. And when I'm on top, they\ncome also pretty easy. But, maybe I just take a different route. (giggling) - Two cowboys talking about jiu-jitsu. - Top on the streets,\nbottom in the sheets. That's Nicky Rod.\n(Nicky Ryan giggles) - What was the hardest\npart of the training for the training camp for at Wal Kanowski? Like you're just experiencing\nworld class MMA fighters training and given your\napproach of jiu-jitsu of not trying to hard, no matter what. - [Craig] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean from my perspective, there's a lot of pressure for that. You know? Like, that's a lot of\npressure for me to go in and think that I could\npossibly figure out a way to help this guy address\nthis guy that's basically never been beaten. I think he got knocked out once, but, basically not really even\nbeen put in bad positions, you know what I mean? So, that's a lot of pressure on me. Especially cause Volkanovski\nis such a great guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - Jiu-jitsu's different, you know, like you coach a guy, he\nloses, he has time to tap, but he never make you gets severely hurt. - [Lex] Yeah. - There's a lot more weight in what you need to do as a coach. You have a greater sense of responsibility to their health and wellbeing. You know? Like obviously, I know Volks' kids, I know his wife, you know what I mean? They're putting faith in you\nto not just win the fight, but keep this man safe, you know? So, from my perspective, a hell of a lot more pressure coaching him as an MMA fighter. - So, almost like the\npsychological aspect of like, of doing the best you can for him. - Exactly. Yep, yep. - What was the hardest\nabout the actual training? Was it the technical aspect\nof trying to figure out the puzzle of Islam or was it like, being a good training partner in the... Like, in figuring out how\nthe grappling would work, basically playing your best\nimpression of Makhachev. Were you trying to\nactually impersonate him? Like not just visually, but like in style. - Yeah, definitely. Definitely, visually. - You're not as good looking but go ahead. - Ha, a little taller, but--\n- [Lex] All right. - No, in terms of the training, yeah, I mean Islam's known as\nincredibly strong guy, so obviously, I'm heavier than Islam. So theoretically, I should\nbe able to replicate that strength difference, And then in terms of grappling, targeting those submissions\nthat Islam does, like focusing on those\nin the training room, focusing on the way he holds half guard. And really fo--- In the grappling sense, trying to replicate him on the ground. And then, yeah, I wrestle with him on the wall\na ton, trying to replicate, obviously to the best of my ability, a lot of the stuff he does on the wall. Body lock heavy, inside trip, Uchi Mata's. And just constantly put\nin the work on Volks, you know what I mean? Like, constantly chaining\nattacks against him. Really replicating that. - As he's trying to get up and escape and all that kind of stuff. So, all these submissions\nlike, both judo and submissions just attacking, attacking.\n- Exactly. And there's only so much he can do really, cause obviously he's been, I think he's been fighting a long time. So, it's like you are trying to polish what he already is good at. You can't just completely\ncreate an entirely new game for him in the space of six weeks. So, you're trying to take what\nhe's already effective at, add to it. And luckily a lot of the stuff\nhe's already very good at was easy to add to for the fight. - Question from Reddit, \"I'm very curious why other MMA fighters don't employ high profile\ngrapplers from B-Team and New Wave to improve their grappling. That's from the sub-writer. \"By now it's clear that\nthey are levels above almost everyone in MMA simply\nbecause fighters there don't specialize in grappling. But, it doesn't seem like\nfighters, even champions, get training partners from\nthe most successful teams. Why is that the case?\" From your experience, why doesn't Khabib call you? - He might now.\n(chuckles) (Lex chuckles) Put in a good word for me. - Oh, oh I will. Yeah. (laughter) - That's right. He takes a joke pretty well. - [Lex] Yeah. - No, you'll be welcome with open arms. (Craig laughs) - I think your average jiu-jitsu coach, MMA fighters have bad\nexperience with jiu-jitsu guys. Jiu-jitsu doesn't have\na massive place in MMA. Obviously, rounds, standups. It's hard to submit people. Your average Brazilian\njiu-jitsu black belt doesn't know anything\nabout holding a guy down, doesn't know anything\nabout how to stand up. - [Lex] Sure. - So, I think if you over overly\nutilize that jiu-jitsu guy, that hasn't had experience\nin more modern No-Gi, or training MMA fighters previously, it's gonna be a complete\nwaste of time to 'em. I think they're smart\nenough to realize that. - Do you have, and do you guys, do you have interest in MMA at all? Just not even like, well certainly, just competing yourself. But like, just understanding\nthe puzzle of MMA? - Yeah, I mean, I've been a\nfan of mixed martial arts, you know, for a very long\ntime before I trained jits. Personally, I'd much\nrather coach than fight. But I mean, I'd fight somebody for, you know, a good check and\nI get to pick the opponent. And have a proper camp. - Okay. (laughs) - I can think of a good\nopponent, you know? - Which dude was that? All right. (laughter) Who do you think is the greatest\nMMA fighter of all time? Craig, we can start with you. Just as a fan of the sport, as somebody who's been deep in it. - I mean, from my perspective,\nafter that performance, I'm gonna say Volkanovski\nbecause he was able to decisively outstrike Max Holloway, one of the greatest strikers in the sport. - [Lex] Yeah. - [Craig] And he was able\nto hang with the wrestling of Islam Makhachev. And in terms of Ortega, he was able to survive Ortega, who has some of the most dangerous\nsubmissions in jiu-jitsu. So, I think in my opinion, technically, he's the best. - So even though, he technically\nlost, he still has a crown. - [Craig] I believe so.\n- Proven himself, - Given the size difference, given he's moving up in weight. - [Lex] Yeah. - I think all those factors really. - The underdog, everything, the pressure. - Did you think he\nwould be able to hang in any of the wrestling exchanges with Islam? - No, no, no. I was really surprised. That's why my eyes like, it's kind of funny. Like, winning at the end of the day, I feel like judges influenced that. Although, I did think\nAustralian judges would, would rob the other way.\n(chuckling) But I was assuming they kind of, somebody paid somebody\nand not enough maybe. But in general, I just thought\nhe won sort of in the eyes of what martial arts stands for. Like, sort of go to the\nfire and survive and thrive. And finish the last round strong, which is kind of was like\nspiritually is what a victory is. So, I wish we kept going like. - [Craig] One more rounds.\n- Yeah, exactly. That kind of thing. Well, what about you? What do you think? Like, who are the fighters you admire? Like, who do you think is\nthe greatest of all time? - I think the fighter I\npaid most attention to was John Jones. You know, he has a great\nability just to mix the high level striking,\nhigh level grappling. Although his, you know, jiu-jitsu\nby itself isn't, you know, probably isn't like, you\nknow, super high level. But his ability to mix\neverything together, I would say he's the best. And he's a fellow, you know, heavier guy, heavyweight now. So, it's nice to see, you know, how those guys move at that weight. - And a fellow natural athlete? (soft laughter) See what I did there? All right. What about you, Nicky? - Yeah, if I had to pick a G.O.A.T. I would probably have to say Khabib, just because he was undefeated. And he had a very, you\nknow, high finishing rate. You know, very few of his fights actually went to a decision.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - So he just, overall, he dominated\nalmost every single opponent he went against. - The dominance. I mean, we've been joking about it, but Craig, what do you think makes the Dagestani fighter so good? Like, from this small region of the world? So, much dominance has come. - I mean obviously, the amount of freestyle wrestling\nchampions from that region probably puts their wrestling\nabove and beyond the best in all of MMA. And obviously, even in the Olympics, a lot of champions outta there, right? So, I think that skillset\ncombines with them adding effective pin\ncontrols on the ground and jiu-jitsu submissions. But I mean, again, I think it's that hard training those guys like Khabib,\nwould maintain that pressure throughout the entire\nfight and break guys down. Their ability to fatigue\nguys to a breaking point, I think is something they do best. - I wonder what that is. What is that, technique? What is that? What is it about their upbringing? Cause it's just that part of the world. Or the Saitiev brothers with\nthe freestyle wrestling side to all the mixed martial arts people. Like, it must be part\nof the culture, also. They must be doing something. I don't think, I've never, I haven't seen a convincing\nexplanation of why, yet... Of what's specific about their training, what's specific about their\nculture that creates that. Okay. What do you think about\nlike the flip side? Do you admire somebody\nlike Conor McGregor who knows how to create a spectacle? You Craig, who likes spectacles. - Spectacles, yeah. I mean, I really admire\nearly Conor McGregor, cause I found him absolutely hilarious. You know? Like, I felt like that was peak banter. I feel like he just took\nthe American world by storm. Aussies, British, Irish, Kiwis. I believe we have a way\nbetter level of banter and attacking each other. And it's almost too easy\nto pick on Americans to take themselves very seriously. I mean, arguably even, other\nparts of the world too. The far east of Europe, you know? - Well, that's the\ntricky thing with Conor. I think he was, I feel like you could've gotten\nin the same kind of trouble cause the Russians really took\neverything very seriously. They weren't joking around. - Yeah, that's the problem. It's like, it's a bit of, I mean, some things he definitely\ntakes too far, you know? But I felt like early on\nhe had the right balance, where he wouldn't really\ncross a line but he would do, he would do enough. He just took it to another level, Obviously, later in his career. But I think early on,\nbit of innocent banter. - He gets a lot of eyes\non the sport though. He's probably by far the\nmost popular combat athlete of all time because of that. - [Craig] Yeah. - I feel like you have to cross the line. I don't think enough people\nappreciate like the values he's brought by crossing the line. - He's making a sacrifice\ncrossing the line that's gonna affect him for\nthe rest of his life, you know? - I see. I don't think so. I think you can always walk back. Cause I think unlike-- People might disagree with this. I, well, yeah. I thought he always radiated\na respect for the opponent. Like, afterwards. And underneath it. It felt like the same way you do. When I hear you shit talking, I don't see a person who really means it. I see a person who's having fun with it. I always saw Conor McGregor the same way. I don't know. But people took it like\nextremely seriously. But, I saw the respect, like the common respect\nthat martial artists have for each other, that felt\nlike it was always there. If you don't like that individual, you are gonna perceive,\n- [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - What they say more negatively than if you obviously were. So, I feel like if you like someone, you're gonna never think\nthey really crossed the line. - That's true. So, you're saying I like you. That's why I'm perceiving\n- It must be. - Your bullshit in a positive light. Are there people that hate you? - I mean, some of the family\nmembers, its a staple. (laughter) - People that really get\nto know you all hate you. All right. - The fans love me, the friends hate me. - It's a good place to be. Keep your enemies close. All right. What do you think is the\nmost important muscle for jiu-jitsu? Is it biceps? - Oh, I think a strong, I think a strong back. I think back one, core\nsecond, and then biceps. - Okay, biceps. Cool. Do you legitimately think like weightlifting helps jiu-jitsu? It's kind of the discussion\non the steroids is like, the muscle mass and strength and power, and explosiveness, all of that. - I think sometimes when we're at that upper echelon of\ncompetition, there's only, there's like little minute\nbattles that you have to win in. And if you're relatively\nclose in technique, then a lot of times, a\nstronger opponent pulls it out. - But it could be also\njust a limitation, right? You hold position too long. What about for hobbyists? Do you recommend weightlifting? Like, when you've seen people in the gym? - I always recommend weightlifting. I almost see muscle as\nthe body's armor, right? The more armor you have, the more damage you can kind of take. And, you know, maybe recovery\nis a little bit better. And I've always seen\nweightlifting as a means to stick to my routine. There's no point in lifting\nif you're not eating right and you're not sleeping right. So, if you kind of put it all together, then it's beneficial. - What about you guys? Do you go to the gym? - I go to the gym, yeah. - Do you go to like, the hotel gym, to using an elliptical\nand that butt machine or. - Yeah, I focus on the glutes heavily. - All right. (giggles) What about, like, what about\ninjury prevention and so on? How do you train to\nminimize the risk of injury? You guys have all been pretty beat up. You've gotten a major injury with the ACL. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah. - So, how do you train to minimize injury? - Probably not the right guy to ask, eh? (Nicky Ryan laughs)\n- Yeah. Definitely. - Actually, can you talk\nthrough your injury? Like what happened? - Yeah. So, about one week\nprior to this last ADCC, I was wrestling with this guy named Kenta, who was also competing. And I went to go lift him\nfrom like a rear body lock, and he hooked the outside of my leg, and we just felt something pop. You know, he felt a shift with his leg. And, when it first happened, it hurt for like the first 30 seconds. And then I honestly debated,\nI was like, maybe it was just, you know, some freak thing. I was like, I literally thought about\ncontinuing the session. Then the next day I woke up\nand it was like super sore. I was, you know, limping around, couldn't do a full squat. So, it pretty much\nkilled all of my training for the entire week\nleading up to the event. So, I couldn't train or\nanything, messed up the cut. Obviously, there's added\nnerves with that too. You know, when you're\nnot in the gym every day leading up to the competition. I went out there. I wasn't really able to pull\nguard cause I couldn't get, you know, full heel to butt connection. Which is inevitable with playing guard. And I was very hesitant to shoot as well. So, I came out with the idea of just trying to use hand fighting to tire my first opponent out. And then mainly look to get to underhooks or over hooks and do mostly\nupper body wrestling. In the beginning of\nthe match, I, you know, successfully got to an underhook. I got to a rear body lock, he tried to roll and I\nended up in top position and side control. But it was during the no points period. And then as the match went on, I gassed out and eventually,\nhe ended up taking me down and then scoring with\ntwo hooks on the back. - So, what's the injury? - Yeah, so I got an MRI\nactually, after the event. I didn't know--\n- So, you waited. Wait, wait. You waited until after the event? - Yeah, I waited until after. - Like acknowledge, or\nignorance is bliss? Is that-- - Yeah, exactly. I was like, I honestly, I don't even want to know what's wrong. I was like, I just go out there compete. You know, I knew it was\nlike the biggest event to date, and I really wanted to do it. - Did you think about not doing it? - It definitely was a thought in my head. Especially, the day after. You know? It's always the worst\nday whenever you have like a serious injury, is the day after. And I was like, man, I\nreally can't do a full squat. I was like, I don't even know how I'm gonna be able to do this. It got a bit better as the week went on. But I was like, man, I have\nto go out there and compete. I was like, it'll always\nbe in the back of my mind. Like what if? If I ended up pulling out. - What did you think about this whole? - I thought he was just being a pussy. - Yeah. (laughter) - Just slap him around. Just yell at him. Was that the-- - I didn't think we pressured you. We just saw you make\nyour own decision, right? - We're just like, yeah. - Is that tricky thing to do? Like with a heavily, like\na serious injury like this? - We don't know.\n- We didn't know that was the thing, we didn't know. Honestly, initially I thought it was, I had tore my lateral meniscus. But that ended up not being the case. It ended up being a full ACL tear. I was actually super surprised\nwhen I got the MRI results. So yeah, we didn't know\nhow bad it actually was. - What do you think about that situation? - I think Nicky's a tough kid. And I mean, when you're so\nclose to that competition, you know, there's not many, you don't get many opportunities\nlike that to compete in front of, you know, 15,000 people. It's like, you know, props to you for pushing\nthrough it and getting it. And man, he had a close match\nwith one of the best grapplers in his weight class and\nit's like, you know, a few adjustments here and there. And especially, you know, if he was able to train previously, leading up to that match,\nI think Nicky pulls it out. - So, some of the things\nyou mentioned is nerves. So, there's extra nerves just\nbecause you're under prepared. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah, I mean, you know, - Or feeling under prepared. - You wanna go into a\ncompetition with, you know, the confidence. I did everything that I could\nleading up to this event. I trained as much as I could. And then when an injury prevents that, you start to doubt yourself more. - How do you guys think about injury? How do you train, you know, training with the best in the world, training to be the best in the world, and avoiding injury. Cause you've gotten-- You tore your bicep?\n- Yeah. Yeah, I tore a bicep. - Doing curls or?\n- Ha ha. Dude, honestly, I was body building, you know, for like seven years. And no lie, I did, I trained biceps like most days. Like, almost every day\nin those seven years. Pretty much, I injured myself. - That's so jersey, man. That's great.\n- [Craig] Anything else? Or just the bicep? - Just, I mean, no.\n(laughs) Yeah, I injured the bicep pretty much the day before our wrestling\npractice I had like, a killer arm day and by arm\nday I just mean training biceps very rigorously getting a sick pump. And I go to wrestling\npractice the next day, you know, pretty late. I should have been there. I didn't get a proper warmup in. And the first thing I do is I shake hands and I go to shoot a single leg and boom, I just blew my arm out,\nthe first movement I did. So, just not being warmed\nup properly in addition to, you know, having a very vigorous\narm day, few hours prior. - You hear that about warmup. So like, what are some\nlessons about avoiding injury? - I would say number one\nis, warming up properly. Making sure your body's hot\nbefore you do hot stuff. - Okay. And what does warmup look like for you? Is it jiu-jitsu or non jiu-jitsu stuff? - Yeah, just for a warmup in general. I'll do something like a, if I'm talking competition,\nsomething like, a jog walk back and forth a few times, then a sprint jog a few\ntimes to get that heart rate, you know, up and down. - Yeah. - And then I'll grab a partner. I actually just filmed\nthe DVD or instructional, specifically on the pre-match ritual. In addition to that, I'll,\nyou know, grab a partner, I'll drill some movements. Typically, I'll drill some bad things. Like I'll start from bottom, bottom mouth, bottom side control, workout from there. And then pretty much like 20 minutes in, I'm hot and I'm ready to\ngo for, you know, rounds. - Well, what about you, Craig? So, what's the way to avoid injury? What's the worst injury you've had? - What's the worst injury? I don't even know. I'm pretty good, pretty healthy. Yeah. - Whenever you quit in practice, I'm like, it's a mental injury. - Has your heart ever been broken? - Oh, many times. Many times. But, there's a thing I notice, people that spend the\nmost time warming up, often the most injured. (soft chuckling) It's a strong correlation. - All right. You can't argue with science. - I remember training with Oliver Taza. Oliver Taza would have a 60 minute warmup. - [Lex] Yeah. - Surprise, surprise. Always injured.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Very common.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I find that very common\nin the training room. Now, I think people, it's how they train. Like, if you, Like me, first sign of discomfort, Ooh, back pedal. You know? Push through that stuff. Go too hard, go when you're too tired. You know what I mean? Get too emotional in the role. I feel like those are the\ntimes that I've been hurt, where I've just like, Ugh! I can't let this guy get me. When I have that attitude and tra-- I believe it's how you train\nand sort of obviously-- - So, what does this come from? Like positionally, too? Cause you're training\nagainst some killers. I mean, you're training with him and going probably pretty hard. - [Craig] once a month. - When Craig gets a little tired, he's like, \"Yeah, I'm good for today.\" - Once a month, with Nicky Rod, that's it. (Nicky Rod laughs) - And then you quit like 30 seconds in. - I mean, yeah, you know? You gotta be safe, you know?\n(Nicky Ryan giggling) - I like it. What about you? What have you learned from the ACL tear? - Do rehab, yeah.\n- Yeah. Rehab definitely would help. - [Lex] Oh, so you haven't been in like-- - I didn't get surgery. I didn't do essentially any rehab. I just have no ACL in my left leg. - So, what's it like having no-- - The surgeon goes, \"You've got two options,\nsurgery, rehab only.\" Nicky goes, \"I'll do nothing.\" (laughter)\n- Yeah. Definitely should pick up on the rehab. - What's rehab for that look like? Like twice a day doing some weird, - [Nicky Ryan] I don't know. (laughter) - You're clueless. - Like, bands or something. - It's good, he's learned from these. He's learned some valuable lessons about taking care of his body. - Yeah. - What's it like just\ntraining with no ACL? - So, at the beginning it\nwas definitely a little iffy. You know, I would have\nan occasional buckle, like I'd just be wrestling with somebody and go to step back and\nit'd buckle backwards a bit. But honestly now, like I haven't had a single\nbuckle instance in a while. It feels a hundred percent\nnormal when I train. It feels better than my\nother knee, to be honest. Like I've had,\n(chuckles) I had my meniscus taken\nout in my right leg. And that one gets sore more\noften than the no ACL leg. - Okay.\nAll right. So, putting that aside, is there wisdom you've\nlearned from that experience? - Yeah, definitely should\nbe doing rehab and prehab. You know, I think that, you know, especially if you're a hobbyist\nor a professional athlete, you should be lifting, you know, whether you're rehabbing an injury or just for injury prevention. - So, I'm actually closer to Craig, cause I've trained my whole\nlife like pretty hard. Obviously just the hobbyist,\nbut like, twice a day. Did judo, wrestling, all that, and never broke anything, never injured. Kind of like similar philosophy. Except, like last year, I guess, a year and a half ago. I got a tiny like groin pull injury, and it still hasn't healed. And I've been using your\napproach of not giving a shit. - Yeah. - And like, all right, surely this is gonna heal, it'll be fine. But, it hasn't. But, of course if I was\nlike an actual athlete, I would like probably\nstill train through it. Just fuck it, figure it out. But when you have other stuff going on, you just kind of wait it out. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah. - But no, I think probably rehab, especially as you get older, you have to do that kind of stuff. - I think it's important\nfor people to, you know, determine whether what\nthey're going through, is it injury or they're\njust hurt a little bit. Because injury, you\nknow, for sure take time, rehab it, and get better. But a lot of people like\nthey'll stub a toe or something like, oh, you're out for a few weeks. You know, so. - Well, that's the problem\nwith the injury I have. It feels like a stubbed toe. So, I was like, all right, I'll just wait a couple\ndays, it'll be fine. And then a couple days\nlater, it's not fine. And you wait and then I never got an MRI, never got any of that. It's like, I'm sure I'll be fine. Yeah. So, it's hard to know sometimes. Like, what? It's hard to know. I feel like a lot of people\nwill just not check it, oh, I'll be fine. Well, because there's\nseveral failure cases. There is a failure case of\nwhere everything is a stub toe. You're like, fuck it. Like you're bleeding everywhere,\nyou know that's fine. Whatever. So, you have to be careful a lot of people can fall into that too. I think I'm in that category. Go to the doctor. Why do you go to the doctor?\n- Yeah. - Your best approach is typically wait until something else gets hurt, so that you'll forget about the grind. - Yeah, exactly. That's what I was hoping, I was hoping to get hurt, waiting for the broken heart, maybe. Okay. That was very helpful. Oh, you mentioned you're doing a whole thing on the pre-match ritual. Can you kind of preview like what kind of, what's involved in your pre-match ritual? - It's pretty big in the wrestling culture and the fighting culture,\nlike kind of what, what to do before your competition. But I think a few of our, a few people are just kind of missing out exactly what to do. So, I break it down for them. I break it down to people\nlike four weeks in advance, how you should prep, you know? Your trading and your nutrition, and your sleep for competition. In addition to that, I break it down even\nlike to a smaller scale with like, how early you\nshould get to the event, when you should be visualizing,\nyou know, your competition, what to do, like, you\nknow, 30 minutes before, 20 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes. And the kind of mentality\nyou should have throughout those times before you\nactually step onto the mat. - When are you visualizing? Like, how much are you visualizing? When you say competition, you're talking about the\ntournament or the actual people you might be competing against? - A little bit of both. I'll spend time just\nvisualizing the crowd. Like, if it's gonna be, you know, an arena with 15,000 people, I'll spend time in practice and whatnot, like putting myself inside\nthat arena and visualizing, you know, stepping on the mat, and hearing the crowd scream and whatnot. That way, you know,\nwhen competition comes, the time comes, it's\nkind of the same deal. I'm accustomed to it. In addition, when I get to the arena, I'll step on the mat, I'll\nkind of look at everything, I'll expose my senses\nto what it's gonna be. And then I'll kind of shut\neverything off like a lot. Some people, you know, scroll through their phone\nand can treat it like normal, have this normal conversations. For me, I like to limit my sensory intake before I go out and compete. I just feel like sometimes we only have so many decisions\nyou can make in a day. And I want all of my\nbest decisions to be made when it matters, when it counts. - Uh, what about you? Do you limit your sensory input? - On game day? Honestly, no routine, nothing. I don't, yeah, I don't do anything. - [Nicky Rod] This guy's a double silver. - We're both double. (laughter) - You should get it. You should buy his instructional. It might help you. I'll get another silver. (laughter) No, honestly, nothing. Hey, I just try to relax, treat it like it's before training. - Try to visualizations or no. - No, no visualization. - So, the opposite of\nvisualization, you just avoid it? - [Craig] Yeah. - Before thinking about it. - Yeah, I don't even think about it. I'm just like, yeah, we'll have a good time, you know? Try to appreciate it, that I can do it. - By the way, when you visualize, are you visualizing tough positions or you visualize winning, mostly? - Definitely visualize winning. I'll visualize how I'm gonna get to my most dominant positions. Cause you know, in comp, I wanna do what I'm best at. And also see, I see my opponent in his best positions and how I'm gonna escape\nthose if necessary. But most of the time I'm just visualizing exactly what I'm gonna do in that match. And I go out there and do it. - Okay. So, when your teammate Craig is, you know, another like world class athlete has a fundamentally different\nphilosophy than you, do you visualize being frustrated at him? - No, not frustrated, but I'll definitely come into\npractice with like solutions to problems that Craig gives me. You know, like if Craig's, you know, catching me a sub\nor giving me issues like, you know, I'll go home, I'll watch him a match\nthat he lost for motivation and I'll come back and I'll put it on him. (laughter) - Just DM him like a\nhighlight reel of him losing. - Yep. (soft chuckling) What about you? Like, does it affect you that\nyou're a bit of an outlier? - Usually before I compete, or right before I go out there,\nI go, why am I doing this? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Do I still need to do this? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And I think, fuck, hopefully I don't embarrass myself affect my instructional sales. That's the last thought. But, I didn't even put too much thought into the whole competing thing. I'm just like, you know what? Train hard, hopefully have\na good time out there. - What about the motivation aspect? Like, that voice that says\nlike, why am I doing this? That voice can break a lot of people. Like, in the weight cut, it\ncan break a lot of people. Like, why am I doing this stupid,\nsilly sport like you said. A bunch of dudes just rolling\naround like, what's the point? - I'll come up to someone\nwith a 9 to 5 job, and I'll be like, yeah,\nthat's why I'm doing this. You know? Avoid that. (giggles) - [Lex] Sure. - [Nicky Rod] With all those DVDs, man. - Yeah, I didn't get\ntoo deep on competing. - [Lex] Yeah. - We're so polar opposite. (Craig cackles) It's like almost uncomfortable\nto be around you. - Obviously, one of us is a clean athlete. (laughter) - You should do a DVD on that. What about you in terms of\npreparing for competition, Nicky? The day before, the day of, are there rituals that you follow? - Honestly, like the few\ndays leading up to it, it's different for me every time. Like, sometimes I'll\nwarm up before I compete, sometimes I won't. Sometimes I'll fast, sometimes I'll eat. So I literally, it's\njust completely random. I don't follow any specific thing. But in the training room\nleading up to the competition, I'll definitely, you know, like Nicky Rod, visualize\nthat I'm walking out onto the competition mats. You know, I'll pick somebody that's, you know, a similar body type to the person that I'm competing against. And then, you know, we'll start out with some distance between us. We'll come out, smack hands, and you know, act like everything's a real competition. I'll even sometimes have, you know, corners that will yell out\ntimes and things like that just to replicate it as much as possible. - That's funny, because\nI've talked to a lot of Olympic gold medalists. I used to do a podcast\nwith like, athletes. And they all sound like Nicky Rod. The two of you are outliers. I don't know, sometimes\nI'll do this, sometimes. So anyway, but that's also\njiu-jitsu culture, I think. Maybe the chaos of not\ntaking things too serious is actually really, really helpful. Sometimes the pressure of\ntaking everything way too seriously can break you. - I mean, I just don't think\nit's that big a sport really. You know? Like-- - I think if I compete\nevery day in practice, it'd just make competition much easier. So, I just put the pressure on there. - On the competition, yeah, yeah. On the, sorry, on the training, on the competing in the training. I don't know. Olympic sports aren't that\nbig either, financially. And people take it extremely,\nextremely seriously. Like, you don't really even\nget that much money from judo. - I mean, I just don't take\njiu-jitsu that seriously cause like, I was just partying,\nhaving a good time until 21 and then I was like, oh fuck. Do I get a job, or do I\npursue professional sports? And I feel like if I can made a career in jiu-jitsu\nwith a decision at that point. - And now you just\nstumbled your way somehow, into like being at the top of the would. - Yeah, that's what I feel like. I just walked into it. I feel like I couldn't just\ndo that in wrestling, boxing. I couldn't do that in other sports. - What was the toughest\nmatch you've ever had that pushed you mentally,\nphysically, technically? This doesn't have to be\nthe best person you faced. But was there like a moment\nin your career that was like, really defining for you? - I mean, I would say like\nthe toughest mentally, was just this last ADCC, you know? I just had a big injury leading\ninto it that kind of screwed the whole camp and weight\ncutting everything up. So yeah, I would say the last ADCC. - Are you proud of your performance there? Like, you stepped on the mat that you pushed through all of it? - Like I said, I'm a very competitive\nperson and I hate losing. So, definitely not, yeah. - You had a collapsed lung. (Nicky Ryan giggles)\n- Yeah. (Nicky Rod laughs hysterically) - [Nicky Ryan] Actually, - K, can we elaborate on this? - [Nicky Rod] Oh, man. Dude.\n(laughs) - He was so physically\nexhausted afterwards, couldn't breathe. We had to get medical intervention. He thought he had a collapsed lung. (giggles)\n- No, no. I was the most tired that\nI've ever been in my life in that match. I actually popped a\nblood vessel in my eye. I was trying so hard. - He comes out, he walks off of the ADCC\nmat backstage and I'm like, I'm kind of getting\nwarmed up for my match. And Nicky run comes, he walks over huffing and puffing. And his mom's right next to me. He looks at her, he is like, \"I think I need help. I think I got a lung collapse.\" - That's not true. (laughter) - [Nicky Rod] No? That's not true? - My mom's the one that\ncalled for medical help. - Oh, okay, okay. - I was just laying on\nthe warmup, fucking dying. (laughter) - Well, we're happy you're fine. (chuckles)\n- Yeah. - Two working long. - Laid it all on the line. What about you, Craig? - Defining or toughest matches? - [Lex] Mhm. - I mean, they're all\npretty tough, you know? I don't know. I can't really pinpoint one. I mean probably the most annoying\none was obviously the one where I had Gordon Armbar. I was like, tap bro. And he wouldn't tap, so I let him out. (Nicky Ryan laughs) Mentally, I was like, I\nshouldn't have done that. - Do you ever have a thing\nin your brain where it says, should I should shit talk now or not? And you ever, you say, no, I'm gonna be respectful. - I just can't be serious\n- [Lex] Yeah. - About some of these things, you know? I don't know, it's just silly. It seems silly.\n- Yeah. All of it. The whole thing. What about you, Nicky Rod? - Dude, honestly, most\nof my toughest matches are in the training room, right? Because I started with these guys, I started training under\nthem like, you know, started training at DDS when\nI didn't have any knowledge. Like, I knew wrestling, I knew like a knee cut in jiu-jitsu. But like, I started training\nwith them when I knew almost no jiu-jitsu. And then I had to like, you know, really work my way up. So definitely, in the\ntraining room, like being, like having one of these\nguys on my back or like, there's a stretch of like a\nfew weeks or months when Covid first hit and there was just like, four of the best grapplers in the world. And we just did drilling and live rounds with these four guys and\nit was just, it was hard. It was very hard, you know, every round we're doing six rounds, seven days a week with the\nbest grapplers in the world. And it's like, you get no break, and you're forced to learn on the go. So, I think, for me in the training room, that was definitely my toughest matches. And that's where I built, you\nknow, those mental callouses. - That was a period where I\ndrew with Nicky Rod probably, what, nine months? 12 months?\n- [Nicky Rod] Yeah. - And typically speaking, like I said, no warmups the first round, we\nusually take it pretty easy. First round you start in mount. The whole room, the rest\nof the training room, they take mount very lightly. Me and Nicky Rod would be\nfighting to the death every day. I felt like we did an\nextra round every day. It was very grueling-- - I'm very mean when I'm in\nthe midst of drilling or live. Like, we would do, we would drill wrestling, you know, quite a bit, like stand up. And in the drilling, like, I just wouldn't\nlet Craig take me down. Like we're not gonna\nlie, we're just drilling, but I just wouldn't let\nhim put me on the floor. So, things like that, you know? (laughter) - I know it escalate. - Yeah. - So, you mentioned mount, like, so you do positional training? So is that, would that be the hardest\nversus like live training open like, starting from guard? - I would say mount and turtle definitely, definitely made me very tough. Cause you spent all this effort\ngetting off of bottom mount, and then you gotta get on top of a guy. At the time I'm not that\ngood at holding guys down, so they escape quick and I'm like, fuck, I just tried to hold him down. Gotta go back down. Same thing with a turtle. It's like, you start bottom turtle, you're trying to explode,\nget out and get away. And then you know, you switch and this guy\ngets up pretty quick and you're like, damn, I\ngotta go right back down. It's that constant circle man. It's very tough. But definitely, you know, built\nsome character on the mat. - What do you think is the\nvalue of positional training in general in jiu-jitsu? Actually, this one just\ninteracting with you guys. It's not commonly done in just\nlike regular jiu-jitsu gyms. What do you see? Because probably it's not\ncommonly done cause it's so-- Most of the experience\nis just frustrating. Like, if you're evenly matched, you're basically\nfrustrated the whole time. If you're doing it right. - There's a psychological\nbattle that happens in like the mountain turnarounds. It's like, you know, cause maybe you get\nclose to subbing a guy, or maybe you do sub him, you know, when you start on\nturtle and you're on their back, you finish 'em and then you\nget this high point and then immediately you gotta go back\ndown to defensive posture. - Yeah. - And it's very like, it's emotionally like up and down. So, it's hard to deal with. - Super important if you are one of the better people in the gym. Cause it just puts you in positions you don't find yourself\nin, in regular training. So, I think like a lot of, if you're a big fish in a small pond, you don't do positional sparring, you're probably gonna get\nexposed in competition. You might even look\nsilly in those positions. So, you really have to\nforce yourself to do it despite the fact that you've\ngiven someone worse than you a position where they might catch you. So, you have to sort of put the ego aside. - Yeah, that's one one of the things when I was training regularly, of course training with you\nguys, it's like trivial. But, I didn't work on putting\nmyself in bad positions. When you get better and you regret it. Cause, the big negative thing\nit has consequence it has on competition is you don't\ntake as many risks, cause you're kind of afraid\nfor your back to get taken. All that kind of stuff. - That was me before I went to DDS. I remember I showed up\nthere in that old position, I was like, fuck this.\n(laughter) You better earn this position, you know? - [Lex] Yeah, exactly. - I didn't really have escapes. That was a learning\ncurve for me, for sure. - Do you see the value\nin positional training? Or is it just the source\nof tremendous frustration? - Yeah, I definitely think\nit plays a big part in, you know, your confidence\nwhen you step out onto the competition mats, you know? Being confident that even\nif you get put in the worst possible situations, you know what to do and\nknow how to work out of 'em. - So, I had a long\nargument with Roger Gracie, when you visited and he thinks mount is the most dominant position. Even No-Gi versus Beck. Is there a case to be made for that or no? - I think all of your opponents utensils, their tools are in front of them. So, like if you're on mount,\nthey still have, you know, there's a few ways to get out mount. I think if you're on somebody's back, I'd personally much rather\nbe on somebody's back than, - Flattened out. I'd rather have someone's\nback than flattened out. - Boots in, flattened out. Yeah. - Boots in, flattened out. So, not even body triangle,\nbut just flattened. - Just completely flat. Almost like they're position\nMMA where you see guys get finished cause they can't get out. I think that position is probably the hardest\nposition to escape. - Can you see what Hodge's\ntalking about with mount? Or is he just that good\nat mount that he says? - He might mean the Gi,\ncross collar, you know? I don't know. Or did he mean--\n- Well, he says controlling-wise. He just believes that you can complete-- That there's, he actually thinks there's\nmore ways to get out from the back than\nthere is from the mount. - Prior to--\n- Getting up, including like, physically. - Prior to the keeping escape, I would probably agree with him. But that keeping escape's\nso difficult to manage. It's the funny looking escape. We--\n- [Lex] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Craig] Legs are wiggling. People have a lot of trouble. It's like super hard to learn how to do. But then once you learn how to do it, the effectiveness is just huge. - [Lex] Yeah, it's a weird one. When did that come to be a thing? Is that pretty recent? - [Craig] I mean, I saw DDS\nguys using it first, I think. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah. - Who was the first guy to\ndiscover something like that? This seems like a ridiculous\nthing to discover. - Yeah, like what if I just wiggle? (laughter) - I thought it was a joke at first. I was like, you guys really doing this? He's like, \"Yeah.\" All right. (laughter) I remember somebody\nshowing me like a technique where like, if you just\nlike walk your hand on a mat or something like that. - Maybe an arm triangle\nor something like that? - Yeah, yeah. - Trying to walk the arm behind the arm. - It's just like a funny discovery like, as opposed to like\ntrying to like shove it in, just like, walk it. - I like doing that to people, but with things that aren't true. (Lex laughs)\n- You know what I mean? I'll just tell 'em this is\na technique and watch 'em try to work out if I'm\nbeing serious or not. - Yeah, that's what you do\nwhen you achieve guru status. They'll just listen to you\nlike you're Steven Seagal. - See what they'll believe. - Speaking of which, how do you balance, you have to travel all across the world. How do you balance that\nwith running a school or being a world class jiu-jitsu athlete? - Oh, me. I mean, the secrets of\ntravel for me are two drugs, Xanax and Modafinil. That's how we time adjust and\nwe hit the ground running. - What does Modafinil do? Xanax puts you sleep. - I mean, I have narcolepsy. So, it's a narcolepsy medication. (laughter) - How does that work with the steroids? - [Craig] How does it work? I mean, they work well together, you know? - Yeah.\nNice. - Focused and physical recovery. But in terms of traveling and\ntraining and stuff, it is, I mean we're lucky cause we've\ngot so many high level guys. So like, we can travel and\nthey're still in good hands. I mean, it would be a\nproblem if me, Nicky Rod, and Nicky Ryan left and the gym had Ethan. That would be a problem.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - But, we gotta make sure\nit's not just him there. - Although everyone says\nthey're happy when you're gone. So, that's the rumor I heard. - Happy when I'm gone,\nbut they do miss me. - [Lex] Yeah. - For sure, until I get back. - All right. What about you? Just like balancing it, do you try to stay completely\nfocused on competing, like for some of the big\nmatches you have coming up? Or are you able to kind of diversify? - Well, I like to, yeah,\ndiversify my training to where, you know, if I don't have\na competition scheduled, I'm more focused on skill\ndevelopment and you know, getting better and\nbroadening my tool shed. But you know, if I'm like\nsix weeks before comp, I really start amping up the intensity that I bring into the mats\nagainst bringing some of that visualization towards practice. And maybe I train less\nvolume pre-competition, but higher output per session. - Yeah. What's a perfect week\nof training look like? - If I'm not in competition mode, I would say Monday,\nWednesday, Friday, twice. Every other day, just once. If I'm pre-comp, just Monday\nto Sunday, once a day. - So, that's on the mat. You're doing the full\nlike, positional training, live training. - [Craig] Bicep curls. - Bicep. Oh yeah, I do a lot of bicep curls. Yeah, I'll lift a few times a week now. - Yeah, yeah.\n- Yeah. - Cardio or no? Cardio's all mat, though. - Cardio's all mat stuff. I do, do some CrossFit\nworkouts like CrossFits. I'll do like some EMOMS, or some AMRAPS, or CrossFit, you know, terms. - That's for Instagram. - Yeah. But yeah, CrossFit is a good\nway to kind of like push that that threshold sometimes on\nthe mat cause I'm so good, I can't always get that\nlike full red line. So, I'll hop in across the\ngym and I'll do some workouts that, you know, bring me closer to death. - What about you, Craig? What is a perfect week\nin training look like? Like when you're back home training. - I try to be at the gym twice a day, every day, when I'm back. Just cause I travel a\nbit more than these guys. So, I try to be there\neight and 12 every day. Hang out in between. I usually, Definitely usually, train\nboth of those sessions, depending on how my body feels. - You're doing positional,\ndoing every like technique, positional, live. - I should probably do more positional because I'm just trying to\nwork on wrestling and stuff. And especially leading up\nto Volkanovski's last fight, I was trying to wrestle more\nand focus on those areas even before I traveled over there. Just some experimentation\nwith some stuff, but yeah. - How do you experiment with stuff? Like how do you, So, there's like regular positional stuff, but when you have ideas, like, where? Do you do it in during\nthe training sessions, or do it outside of that? Do you get together with somebody? - Usually, every session I show up with something I'm thinking of. Usually something from top,\nmaybe something from bottom. And then I just try to\nmaybe pick the right people. Some people obviously I'm just\nfighting to the death with. It's not a good time to experiment. And then others obviously you can, you can play around with ideas on. - Okay. What about you? What's a perfect week look like? Maybe. Well, you said you're\na hundred percent now. - Yeah. See, yeah, honestly I have pretty much\nthe same schedule as Nicky Rod. So, Monday, Wednesday,\nFriday, I do twice a day. Every other day, once a day. And then normally, noon practice\nis like our biggest class. That's where, you know,\nall the pros go in. So, I tend to do more open rounds there. And then we have a 7:00 PM class as well, which is more hobbyists. And that's where I'll do my\npositional rounds and you know, force myself to be put in bad positions. - So, you have what you do? 8:00 AM, 12, like in\nterms of what B-Team has. 8:00 AM, 12, and 7:00 PM. And the hobbyists are more 7:00 PM. - Yes. - Okay. Do you believe in over training? Do you think you can overtrain? - I used to not believe in it.\n(laughter) But, then I got hurt.\n(laughs) I was like, all right. - Oh, you attribute that to over training? The biceps. - I think, dude, I'm\ntelling you I trained, I lifted like a bodybuilder\nfor like seven years. And by lifting, I mean, I was\nlifting seven days a week. And I trained arms most days. Like, almost every day I\nwould do like, you know, four or five sets and get\na pretty good bicep pump, in addition to my lift. I think that had to contribute\nsomewhat towards my trade. - Fair enough. Well, what about on the\nactual mat over training? Like explaining too\nmuch time with the mat? - Well, I-- - Like, psychological,\nphysical over training. - I think you can definitely\novertrain but it's more of a, like, as your body's healthy, you have to make sure your mind is sharp. Like sometimes, maybe\ntaking a day away or even diverting your attention in a\ndifferent aspect of training can help you be a little\nbit sharper overall. Sometimes it can be like, it can get a little like stagnant, cause you're doing the\nsame stuff over and over. But I think if you just keep like, you know, over-training,\nthen your overall baseline just gets higher and you become, you know, accustomed to that. - What about you? You don't seem like a guy that over. - I've heard of it. Never been close to it. Nah, I think controlling\nhow hard you train is definitely protects you from injury, you know what I mean? Like, if you are redlining yourself and then you're fighting\nto the death in the gym, that's a hundred percent when\nyou're gonna get injured, gonna get sick. So, I try to make sure\nI've had enough sleep, I've had obviously enough\nfood post-training. And that sort of helps me\nto train a bit harder, but, (chuckles) still try to avoid\nredlining myself too much. - I think I established also like, what days are gonna be your peak days. Because throughout the week, if you're training seven days a week, you're gonna have ups and downs. Like for me personally,\nWednesday, Thursday, Friday usually my best days. And besides that, I also\nhave other great days. - Oh, my days are great. But Monday, Wednesday,\nFriday are also great. You're like, I'm able to admit that some\ndays are awful than others. I love that. I'm always on, bro. Okay. What advice would you give to people who are not always on hobbyists? How to get better. Like, people that are already there. I don't know. Purple belts, brown belts, black belts, they're just like doing\nlike a couple times a week or something like that. Like, how do you get better? - I think being consistent, like find a schedule that\nyou can consistently train. Maybe it's like, you know,\nthree, four times a week. Or even a little bit less. Just be consistent over the years. I think too often people are like, \"Oh, I wanna get really good really fast.\" And it's like, definitely takes a long time\nto get to where you wanna be. What about the, what you're doing during,\nlike while being consistent, what kind of stuff you're working on? - So honestly, I think one\nbig thing for me, which I, something I actually started\ndoing once B-Team was formed was filming all of your rounds and then watching it every day. Cause then you can see what\nspecific problems you're having and then you can base\nyour positional rounds around those problems. - That's really interesting. It's kind of depressing though. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah. - Like sometimes I have to, you know, I edited this podcast for a long time. I still do in part and I\nhate the sound of my voice, and like what I look like. It's tough. But it does make you better. - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah. - And I also hate the\nsound of Craig's voice, and what he looks like.\n(laughter) So, editing this podcast\nwill be especially difficult. This would be doubly difficult. But I'm glad the rest of you are here. I don't know. That's a real thing. Do you watch competition\nfootage of yourself or no? Like to analyze, like to see. - It's my confidence. That's fucking good. - While you're doing curls. - Yeah. - I try not, and still watch\nhim to boost my confidence. - Is there advice you Craig, you would give for\nhobbyists to get better? - I mean, just... Not every round has to be a\nfight to the death, you know? - [Lex] True. - I feel like you're gonna get injured, burnt out that way and you're\nnot gonna learn as much. - [Lex] It's tough. I would say, just as a black belt who took jiu-jitsu very\nseriously for a very long time. Basically, when you become a hobbyist, your skill is basically slipping. Your age and your skill. And so, not taking stuff seriously is actually its own psychological\nskill of like you're... That, it's tough. It's tough. Like, it's tough in a way that is different when you're like\na blue belt or something. That if you work hard\nand you train correctly, you're gonna get much better. Here, you're kinda-- - You're looking downhill. - You're looking downhill, and you're like, \"Yeah, I guess I'm gonna\nenjoy the art of it.\" - Reframe the victory. You know? Like, if it's a young upcoming\nguy and he constant meet you, you're like whoa, that's\na moral victory, you know? - Yeah. But then that has to happen. You have to be able to not do that to avoid the injury, sometimes. Like if you want, So yeah, it's a different,\nit's a different thing. Plus with me, just because some\npeople recognize me, they... - They're coming. - You have that probably. You guys definitely obviously have that. - I've solved that problem. - How did you solve that problem? - Travel around. You do a seminar or anything like that? - [Lex] Yeah. - It's believable that you\ncould get submitted once. - [Lex] Yeah. - But if they catch you give 'em a few. - [Lex] Yeah. - If people tell their friends\nthey submitted me to seminar. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- One time, believable.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - They got me four or five times. - [Lex] Four times, yeah. - You've robbed them of that. - Okay. That's pretty funny. But it's also, they have\nthis energy like they think, you know, they're coming in hot. And I usually like to just\nbasically get submitted quickly twice and just, it changes everything. It makes it more fun. I see. I've noticed it. - Let them submit you twice?\n- Yeah. Just like very quickly. What are the options? (laughter) - [Nicky Rod] We're not, we're not saying they can\nlast longer, hold off. - But then it's like,\nit's very hard to like, Yeah. If you're a very serious\ncompetitor and so on, you take it seriously then, yes. But like then people go-- People, what they try to do. This is probably is what\nhappens to you guys. They try to impress you\nby going super hard. - I have people every day come to my gym, try to take me out.\n- Yeah? - You gotta, I just stay sharp. Come to practice, let's get it on. - Do you feel that energy? I feel like I need to talk\nto Craig here for a second. (laughter) Like, at a seminar, like somebody is coming\nin like really hard. Like, a brown belt will come in. And they really want to\nimpress you with like, their technical side. They're a big fan. They've been watching your DVDs. Like, what do you do with a guy like that? - I make a complete joke out of the roll. You know, give him the\npass, mess with him, do stupid shit, you know? Like, rob them of the realness of it, because it's stupid. I'm not gonna roll hard\nwith strangers, you know? I feel like you should roll with a circle of people you trust. Injuries happen rolling\nhard with strangers cause that's the same way you\nget injured in competition. Cause you don't have that\nrelationship with 'em. - And I should also mention, that's probably not a good\nway to impress somebody, by just going ape shit,\ngoing a hundred percent. - Oh yeah, not at all. - I think the beauty of just\nis like the camaraderie of it. Like, as you get to know\neach other's like technical, like different ideas you\nhave and all of that. Yeah. Okay. Do you think Gi jiu-jitsu is\ndying in popularity, Craig? - Yeah, it's long dead. I think it's just, I\nmean it just shows like, I mean, I have heard some\nnumbers on the viewership for the Gi World's finals\nand they don't even compare to the undercard of like,\nwho's number one events. So, I think like when I\nwas coming up and competing in the Gi all the time, you looked at those guys that\nwon black belt championships, and you were like in awe of them. It almost had that ADCC champion feel. But now, that's not the case. You know, I just feel like\nthat the younger generation aren't looking at who's\nwinning black belt Gi Worlds. I personally don't think, and I don't think they're\nlike, they wanna be that guy. They wanna be like a Ruotolo, Gordon. You know, those are the\npeople they wanna emulate. - So, you think like the Gi,\nlike IBJJF Gi tournaments will just keep declining in popularity? - Oh, I think people will still do it. I mean, it's easier I\nthink as you over 30, cause the Gi's a bit of a slower thing and the master's participation\nis bigger in the Gi. Cause obviously in No-Gi is now heading in a wrestling direction. Wrestling and heel hooks, you're over 30. That's a terrifying prospect, you know? What's terrifying about the Gi? Less, so I think in a participation rate, the IBJJF will still be good. But I just don't think\npeople are as interested as they used to be. - Well, why is wrestling\nin heel hooks terrifying? Like heel hooks, I can vaguely understand, if you don't understand heel hooks. - If you work a desk job\nand you've never wrestled and a guy double legs you, that's gonna probably break you back. You know? I think the older guys\nare scared of wrestling. - [Lex] Huh. - It's hard to wrestle at 40. - [Lex] To learn wrestling at 40. - Is it? Yeah, it's hard, yeah. I mean, I think it's\neven just hard in general to do wrestling at 40. But it's easy to pull half\nguard in the Gi at 40. - I think it's harder to do judo at 40, and people still do it at 40. Judo hurts more. - Judo's scarier than all of them. - Yeah. I think, does wrestling really hurt at 40? I don't know why I'm looking at you. - I don't know. I got a couple of years. - It does? Interesting. I mean--\n- I feel, I agree with you saying that Judo looks like the most dangerous. Like, even they're practice partners, they're just getting slammed flat. Bueno. - Yeah, I did. I mean, I did judo for a really long time. There's a lot of people\nthat are 40, 50, 60 do judo, and they get. - They're the ones that\nare still alive though. (Lex chuckles) - It's true. Survivor bias. You do a little bit of judo, right? - [Craig] Me? I'm a yellow belt. - You're a yellow belt in Judo? I should be your instructor. (soft laughter) Promote you to orange. - I got a yellow belt in the sixth grade. I believe it was the sixth grade. I did it for about, I don't know, sixth months. - But you're also using judo\nin competition, basically. Aren't you doing like Harai\ntype throw like you're doing? - Yeah, I don't know where I learned that. I just started doing it. - You just started lifting\nyour leg in various ways until it works.\n- Just figured it out. Yeah.\n- [Lex] Okay. Doing different kinds of tricks. - I looked at the Sambo guys doing it, I was like, \"It can't be that hard.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Gave it a crack. - Well, they looked at your foot locks and they said that can't be that hard. - They said it can't be that hard, ban it from the tournaments. (laughter) - All right. What do you think is the best\ntake down in No-Gi jiu-jitsu? Like what? Like, if people were trying\nto train for a competition and so on like, where do\nyou see the trends heading? - I think those foot sweep is\nlike catching fire nowadays. Seen a lot of foot sweeps. Foot sweeps and arm drags. I would say pretty, pretty\npopular in our sport. - Arm drag. It's just go arm drag to Okay. - Arm drag either to get 'em, like, get to behind them or\neven just to cause reactions, make them pull away and\nwe can start reattacking. - Are you talking about it in a context of what's the best takedown to score? What's the safest takedown\nto mitigate the risk of guillotine submission? Or most effective in general? - Yeah, most effective combined. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, hopefully it's about scoring. - I think any sort of body\nlock, you know what I mean? Locking your hands around the body. You've been able to put\n'em to the floor that way. I feel like that's most effective, safest, might even have arisen\nout of a leg attack, leg entry, upgrade to the body. - What about like foot sweeps? Like outside foot sweeps? What do we-- - I would say yeah, you know? Foot sweeps from outside\nfoot sweeps or even like, something like you're\ntossing and pulling by and you're sweeping the foot. - Yeah, those are all pretty safe. See, why is that scary? I don't understand. It's not scary at all. - I think it's the lift that is scary. - [Nicky Rod] The lifts, yeah. - Who's lifting people. - Your buddy--\n- Not like a good lift. - No, not you. I mean, in master like, we're talking about\nolder guys doing No-Gi. - Some of those old bosses\ntake it very serious, you know? - [Lex] They should start lifting. - TRT Worlds. - TRT Worlds.\n(laughs) - They're coming. They're coming to impress.\n- Grab a lift. All right. Just for the gram. Okay. What about submission? What's your favorite submission? And what do you think is the\nmost effective submission? Except the buggy choke? - I would have to say the rear naked. It's definitely the one\nthat's hit the most, and the highest level of competition. - Was that uh-- That was pretty interesting\nto see you escape all that and to put put it on. That's the cool thing about EBI, to see like the world class athletes. I was surprised that\nit's possible to escape with you on his back. - Gotta try some B-cream. - Oh yeah, B-cream. And has it helps? What's in the B-- What's the formula or is that a secret? - That is a proprietary blend for sure. - Okay. But that's what you use for greasing. That's what you greased before. - [Craig] Allegedly. - Allegedly. Is there other application\noutside of grappling? - I'm sure you can get creative. - [Lex] All right. Thanks. Asking for a friend. Is that the R&C for you as well? Rear naked choke?\n- Rear naked choke, I mean overall favorite for\nlike solidifying a finish. Cause like, you could put\nsomebody to sleep, right? Even if they don't want\nattack, put 'em to sleep. But, as far as like something\nI've been working on now that I'm now starting to\nimplement in competition, Yoko Sankaku's side triangles. Like, it's a beautiful thing. You have multiple options. You have the triangle to finish. If that fails, you have the\nKimura, you could break the arm. You could also just\ntransfer and take the back. So, Yoko Sankaku, I'm a big fan of, and I continue to progress\nand be better at it. - Have you ever broken anyone's arm? - Oh yeah. I mean the first few competitions cause I was like, you know, pretty athletic grappler\nor athletic wrestler going against local black\nbelts and brown belts. Like, one of my first matches\nI broke somebody a Kimura. Pretty much every time\nI've got a heel hook, which is only twice\nI've broken an opponent. If I have a joint lock,\nit's probably gonna break. Like a lot of times it\nbreaks before they tap. (Lex chuckles)\nYeah. - You seem like a really friendly fella. How hard is it to break an\narm or any break a joint? - Well, I don't think it's that hard. I think, like if you're\ntalking about an arm bar, we have this position to where like people are kind of holding on,\nholding on, and then it slips and their arm starts going. - Sure. - And then it just\nbreaks before they even, you know, get a chance to tap. - I love this sport. - I knee barred a guy and\nhe didn't tap one time. And it was actually, it was surprising. I had to put a lot of force into that. As opposed to arms, shoulders, and the ligaments in the knees and ankles. But to fully, this kid, Sambo a kid,\n- Mhm. - fully let it go and he tapped it. I think the angle is like up here. - Cause they're built different. (hesitant laughter) - Hopefully, he can be reconstructed. - He's rebuilt different. - Yeah.\n(chuckling) - All right. What about a straight foot lock? You've ever, do you guys do straight\nfoot locks at all or no? - Yeah, I mean I'm learning them now. We had some kid come into\npractice one day and like fucking pull out all of us do it. - Pull a straight foot lock? - Straight foot lock. Just this little like Polish kid. - Not only did he foot lock everyone, but he told the entire world. (laughter) He's sending out fucking emails. (laughter) Calling his friends and family. - We practically put a hit\nout on him in practice. And you just sold everybody.\n(laughs) - Yeah, it's always\ninteresting when you get like, people that specialize can surprise you that this could be effective stuff. Do you think there's other\nstuff that could be still discovered in jiu-jitsu? Like, what areas do\nyou think are ripe with techniques to discover? Like wrestling is really interesting now. There's a lot of innovation\nhappening in wrestling. - I think there'll be more innovation when we get people that\nare more adamant about standing up from bottom position. I think when if we get more of\nthe community, they're like, all right, I want to get off the bottom. I think--\n- \"Just Stand Up.\" - \"Just Stand Up.\" - How'd you just, it doesn't work. - We actually changed the name. How Sambo doesn't work,\nif you just stand up. - [Lex] Did you really?\n- Yeah. - [Lex] All right.\n(Craig laughs hysterically) I'll change it to jiu-jitsu\nwhen I hired it and sent it for free to the entirety of the Soviet block. Hey, Nicky Rod, do you think ego is\nuseful for martial arts, or does it get in the way? - Okay, I think you need\nto use it in both ways. For sure, have an ego, like if you're training competition mode. But also it can prevent you\nfrom learning and progressing if your ego's too high. Like you really have to shut the ego down when you're in the mode\nof learning and trying to, you know, develop skills. Cause you're gonna put yourself\nin these bad positions. You're gonna have issues\nwith training partners that aren't necessarily, you\nknow, up to your skill level. But because you're in these bad positions, you have to make these certain sacrifices. And for sure, ego can\nbe a good or bad thing. But if you're able to shut\nthe ego off and learn, then that'll have huge\nprogression when it's time to put the ego on into\nuse during competition. - When's the last time\nyou shut the ego off? - It's been a long time. (soft laughter) (Lex laughing) - What about you, Craig? Do you, I mean, you seem\nto be super easygoing. Is there, like, is the\nego just not part of it? - Oh, for sure. I just don't want anyone to\nknow they've damaged my ego. You know? You have to suppress it deep down. - There's a child underneath\nall of it crying, always. - For sure. I think ego's good for a bit\nof perseverance, you know? Like, it'll help you stick it out against a tough battle with a\ntraining partner for sure. A bit of ego's on the line. Plus the banter back and forth. We're trying to like,\nstir each other up a bit. - [Lex] Talk with the shit, yeah. - I think that helps hone,\nsharpen the ego a bit. - What about you? You, did you try? You seem like a super humble guy? Is there like a monster underneath? - Oh, it's a total act. - [Lex] It's an act. Who's in the basement? - I think ego's a big motivator. You know, I think it's very good to have in the aspect that it, like, it'll drive you to help to want to be one of the best in the world. But like Nicky Rod said, you need to be able to turn\nit off in the training room, and, you know, force\nyourself into bad positions where you may not be winning. - Are there, like, you know,\nDanaher's mentioned Boris. Are there like grapplers, like Boris, this is a question from Reddit actually. Boris-like characters, anybody you've trained with in\nthe past who doesn't compete, but is just an absolute beast in training? Like, people you've\nmet that are just like. - Well, somebody that\nI think has a probably the best like submission grappling in MMA, I think like Gilbert Burns is a-- His submission grappling, that's something that's very, very good. I trained with him early\non in my grappling career, and I was really impressed\nby his ability to move, hold down opponents that\nare trying to stand up, and as a whole, you know,\nhe can get submissions and put people away. - When's the last time? Have you trained with him recently or no? - No, it's been a few years. - Which is impressive ability\nto submit, you're saying? - Yeah. Like, I mean, you know, I'd see Gilbert go against a few, like, pretty decent black belts in\nthe room, and fair well and, you know, maybe he gets to their back, puts a choke and it's like\nGilbert's super high level submission grappling. - Yeah. But he's pretty widely\nrecognized as a monster. So, I don't know if that's even the right answer to the question. It's like you're not\neven listening anymore. - I don't even remember. What was the question?\n- [Lex] Doesn't matter. (laughter) All right, well... Is there people, like you've done all these\nseminars are they're just, especially in the eastern\nblock that you see. - [Craig] Ah, yeah. - Like you went to Kazakhstan. Is there killers out there that? - Oh yeah, there's tough guys out there. Obviously, I don't remember the names, nor could I pronounce it if I did. But, definitely some tough guys out there. Obviously carrying skill sets\nover from wrestling for sure. Not Sambo, but wrestling. - Wrestling. But yeah, are there just\npeople that surprise you that just don't compete\nthat are really good? Have you met those? - I feel like it's less so\ntoday, cause there's so many, so many more athletes in the sport. But definitely when I was coming up, back like in Australian and stuff, there were guys I'd trained\nwith that wouldn't compete and there would be like\nsuper tough rounds for me. - [Lex] Yeah. And there's so many more avenues\nfor competing in general, so, yeah. What about you? Have you met some monsters? - Yeah, one guy I could think\nof in particular is Jason Rau. He trains up in Long Island, I think. Right? Opened up his own gym out there. - [Craig] Vanguard? - [Nicky Ryan] Yeah, Vanguard. He used to compete, but he would never be able\nto compete at the same level he would train at. So, now he's just focused on mainly, you know, opening up a gym\nand teaching his students. But he was a guy that was, you know, extremely good in the training room. You know, world class. I still think to this\nday he's legitimately one of the best in the world, but just doesn't compete anymore. - Who wins in a fight, a lion or a bear? - [Craig] Polar bear?\n- This for you, Reddit. No, not a polar-- Well, yes, it's a good ques-- See, you're on-- Polar bear is pretty impressive. No, grizzly bear. - Grizzly bear. I think a grizzly bear wins. - Well, what's the most\nthreatening predator in Australia? A kangaroo?\n- Well, I mean, it's a tricky question here, cause everyone's scared of\nthe animals in Australia. But I mean, you get bitten by a snake, bitten by spider.\n- [Lex] True. - That's not that bad. Bear. America, bear would just\nhold you down to eat you. That's a much more\nterrifying prospect for me. Even sharks. Shark's gonna be quick. No one sees the shark coming. The shark's just gonna bite you in half. - [Lex] A bear will take a bite and chew. - A bear just holds you down and eats you. So, that's frightening for me. Australia's a bunch of just\nweird shit that can kill you. - Did you see Cocaine Bear\nthe movie that's coming out? - I saw the trailer. It looks good. - [Lex] Yeah. Yeah. So, there's not every bear. There's like black belts\nand there's black belts, there's bears and there's bears. So that, I think that's what they\noften don't talk about. Everybody puts lions and\nbears in the same category. I think there's just some weak bears. - A lion would kill a black bear, I think. - Not every black, again,\nI'm trying to tell you, there's differences.\n(laughter) - But grizzly and polar\nbear, I'm betting on those. - Yeah, no, I think\ngrizzlies have the size, but actually every video\nI've seen of grizzlies, they tire out within like 20 seconds. They get bored. - That's the gas thing? - [Lex] Yeah, that's the gas thing. - That's a Nicky Ryan gas thing, right? - That's all they got. Tree mold.\n(laughter) - And they try to just take a breather. Like there's these crazy\nfights between bears and they last like 20 seconds. - I heard this story\nabout a Russian family that was attacked by a bear\nin Russia and killed the dad. And it took so it took so\nlong to eat the daughter, she made three phone calls to her mom while it was eating her. And the first call, the mum\nthought she was pranking her. - [Lex] That's crazy. - That's way scarier than what we thought. - [Lex] Yeah, that's terrifying. - Gimme a snake bite any day. - [Lex] Yeah. Hey, you know what?\nLet me change the question. Is like, if you had to\nfight a bear or a lion, how would you try to defeat it? Do you think you have a chance at all? - Well, I think I'd, I'd attack a lion a little bit differently than I'd attack a bear. - What would be the difference? - Okay. Well, I've seen this video where lions are eating and you\nhave three like scrinny guys walk up behind them and\nkind of scare the cat off of - Yeah.\n- Off their food. I think, maybe I produce some\nprops, scare the lion away. Right? But if I have to fight it, if I have to fight it straight on, I mean, the thing is that you can't,\neven if you take that back, like you can't like bite it or choke it. The mane is too big to lock\nyour hands around, you know? - Are you sure about that? Cause the mane's just hair. - Yeah, the mane's hair. - [Nicky Rod] Yeah, but it's thick hair. It's like matted hair, right? I dunno. So, I think, - You think you can maintain\nback control on a lion? - Maintain, yeah, yeah.\n(laughter) But, getting there. Getting there, I think I fake high go low. Right? Make 'em think I'm going\nfor the foot or something. A little paw sweep and I take the back. - What about a bear? I feel like they're easier. That might be easier to\ntake to hold back control. - Yeah, maybe, The thing is if the\nbear falls on its back, it's just gonna crush you. It's so big. It's substantially bigger\nthan a lion, right? Like a full grown lion. - Yeah. And they're also like terrifyingly like, loud with their roars and stuff. - Yeah, I think, So, first of all, if I saw\ngrizzly I'm like, all right, he's gonna attack me. I try to yell a little bit louder to them, maybe deter him a little bit. Like, give him a (grunts softly). - Yeah. - And then yeah, for sure, I'd try to get behind it. I'd probably go like something weird. Maybe like pull the eyes\nout or something, you know? For sure. I mean, I'm going for the\nvital organs, you know? - Play dead.\n- [Nicky Rod] Play dead. - And then over check it. (Lex laughs)\n- There's no pride in that. - Wow. Pride even matters. See the ego, the same advice you gave, you gotta put the ego aside with the bear. Even then, even then. How would you fight a bear or a lion? Just play dead? - Play dead, yeah. Could you beat a kangaroo? A kangaroo? - [Lex] Oh, yeah.\n- Kangaroo? I'd beat the shit out of a kangaroo. (laughter) Yeah, yeah. I mean, are we boxing glove? We just like-- - How would a kangaroo attack a human? - Try to kick 'em with the claws. - Knock 'em down and then they choke 'em. - [Nicky Rod] Stand on that tail. - The kangaroos do? - [Craig] They choke each other, yeah. - They don't choke each other. - [Craig] You don't believe me? You gotta watch the video,\nthey choke each other out. (Nicky Ryan chuckles) - I've seen this, yeah. (laughter) - It's real?\n- [Craig] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - With which? Headlock or what? - Yeah, they knock 'em, and just grip like this and hold 'em. - [Lex] What's the grip? They have like little paws. How are they gripping? - [Craig] I promise you. I'm not lying to you. - [Nicky Ryan] Pretty\nsure I've seen the video. - [Lex] They also do strange shit like if there's a predator around, they'll wait in a pool of water. And then if it comes to\nattack, they drown 'em. They're pretty smart. (Lex chuckles) - Okay. Speaking of which, what's the most effective martial art for winning a street fight? You talked about rule sets and streets. I think you've talked\nabout being in a street-- Have you ever been in a street fight? - Yeah, just one. - [Lex] Yeah. - Nothing special. Nothing crazy. - [Lex] Yeah, you don't\ntalk about that time? Like, for self-defense purposes, what will be a strategy on the street? A little advice. - Whoever wins the street fights, whoever's willing to take it\nthe furthest, the fastest. You know what I mean? If you're thinking you're\ngonna box and he's biting you, poking your eyes, that guy's gonna win. He wants it more, you know what I mean? That's why the crackheads fight. They go for the kill\nstraight away, you know? So, I feel like it's more about\nwho's willing to do the most that's gonna win that fight. - Fastest. The most, the fastest. - Who's got the least to lose, you know? - Okay, we could also\ndefine winning differently cause you could also run away. But in terms of technique-wise, wrestling? Judo? - I think if it's a one-on-one, I'd go, wrestler wins. But, if it's like, you know,\nit's like a multiple people, you gotta go Muay Thai,\nstay on their feet. Can't go down to the ground\nif it's more than one person. - Big double leg maybe. - Yeah. Double leg, put 'em asleep\non the impact, right? Forehead to the ground. - Yeah.\nWhat's the goal here? Is to win the fight and not go to prison? - I haven't thought of\nit through that way. (Craig laughs) Yeah, certainly. Yeah. Yeah. Not go, not to kill the person. - We got mutual combat\nhere in Texas, we good. - Is that in Texas?\n- Mhm. - Do you know what the\npaperwork for that looks like? Do you have to actually sign\nsomething, or can you just say? - I hope I don't need to find out. (Lex chuckles) I did hear a story where\nguys were on Sixth Street and they looked at a cop. They were like mutual\ncombat, mutual combat. - Yeah. - And just got like the cops to say yes and just duped it out. They could be false though. - That sounds crazy. - [Nicky Rod] I'm saying. - I kind of admire that, but I've also been playing\nRed Dead Redemption recently. So, I like internalized the\ncowboy a little too much. Just to return to gym stuff. No, because it's a business. Because you're running a\nbusiness, there's money involved. But, you're also friends. But, you're also training partners. Is there a tension that money creates that can threaten to destroy friendships? That's something I always\nworry about with money. I try not to go do any kind of business with friends or family. - I think if you're all very\nclear and honest and open at the start, makes it much easier. I think people have\nissues when there's like, kind of like things are\nwritten and fine print, and nobody knows the exact answers. - And a lot of jiu-jitsu guys can't read. You know, that makes\nit challenging as well. - [Lex] We're learning that today. - Yeah.\n(laughter) - [Lex] Uh, no. - Definitely complicated though. - Yeah I mean, it's not always obvious how to be transparent and\nstuff about everything. Have you felt that tension? Because in the jiu-jitsu world, money's not really unlimited. Just running a school. What's that like? Because it's the first time\nyou're running a school, running a gym. - Yeah, I mean it's just\nconstantly updating people about what's going on, what your expectations are. You know what I mean? We've had some problems with coaches who I feel like think the\npies bigger than it is. You know what I mean? They feel like maybe we're\ngetting rich out of this, and they're missing out on things. So, it's like even amongst managing staff, that can be challenging too. So yeah, I mean it's a constant\nwork in progress to make. Not only to make sure everyone's happy, But to make sure they're\ncomfortable enough to reach out and tell you they're unhappy. But I feel like those\nchallenges are common amongst any small business. - Still, it sucks. Just to mention, I'm clueless to this. But I'm just now learning this. Somebody I met and talked to\nand I really like is Isaac. And he just learned because\nyou're also active on Reddit. What's your name on Reddit? John Belushi's mom.\n- John Belushi. As under cover as possible, you know? - Oh, it's not you. It's actually John Belushi's mom. Right. (chuckles) So, I've done my research, I guess. And I guess you guys had a\nfalling out and have split. I just wanna say that, I don't know the few\ninteractions I've had with him, he's a beautiful human being. So. And that just shows to me, - Visually, maybe not internally. - And sexually, just the experience. No. He's just a kind person. I don't know. I liked him a lot. Like to me, in a business setting, yeah, tensions are created and it sucks. I don't know. I mean, I suppose money, all the stuff that happened\nin the jungle aside, probably money had a role to\nplay to create extra tension. Money and egos about\nlike who was the leader, who was not the leader, it's tough. It's tough to manage that kind of stuff. I've seen it happen with\njiu-jitsu schools a lot. I don't know exactly what. Cause it's like there's\nalso a hierarchy inside grappling jiu-jitsu schools. Like people that are better or not. There's literally ranks\nblack belt and brown belt. There's like competitors that are better. I mean I don't, it's a weird dynamic in which to operate. Cause like usually, there's more politeness and like humanity layered into the way a company works. But here there's just a bunch of, I mean, it's like violence\nlaid on and on display. Plus money. It's crazy. Is there something you could say to that? Like, how you try to minimize? Or something you want to comment on Isaac? - Yeah, I mean it was\nunfortunate situation. But it just didn't work out. You know, like, there's\ngonna be personality clashes. Some people... - I can't imagine anyone having a personality clash with you. - [Craig] With me?\n- Yeah. - It's hard to imagine. - Yeah, it's surprising. You know, I mean, I don't\neven know what to say on that. I don't want to touch on it too much, but obviously his expectations\nabout his role in the gym, obviously different from ours. Led to some personality clashes that were sort of unresolvable. You know, some things happen\nthat can't be resolved. You can't fix those things.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - You know? Obviously, a lesson I hope for both of us. Definitely a lesson for\nme from a management role to try to address these things sooner. But also, sometimes I came\nup in a different time where there was no\nmoney, no opportunities. I had to pave that. I had to pave that way totally for myself. Especially coming from Australia. Like, being a professional\nathlete in jiu-jitsu was not, I think so I had to pave a lot\nof opportunities for myself. And I feel like sometimes, ohh, I don't know what the right word is. Sometimes people don't appreciate some of the ways you help them. And they just think, feel like almost they deserve or are entitled to certain things. And that is very difficult to manage. But I think again, like we both\nsee the situation different. I do hope he finds a better, a more comfortable place to train. But yeah, obviously I've\nknown him for a long time. Sort of like a brotherly relationship. So, that's gonna really make\npersonal problems a lot worse when you're that close\nto someone, you know? - I just hated that like I've\nseen in jiu-jitsu especially, but in other places, where like close\nfriendships were destroyed because of like gym stuff. Like, people running gyms. And as a person who is, in this case just a fan, but like in general, just like a student, it like sucks. - But again, in my position, sometimes I wonder if there\nreally was a friendship or mere opportunity. I have to be careful of that\nwith some people in the sport. Is it a sincere relationship? Or like, I mean it's\ndifficult for me to tell. Or am I means to an end? - Sure. But I think it's actually a trade off because I think a lot of\nclose friendships we have like even relationships we have. Like, when tested, like, can break if they're\nnot properly communicated. Like, some of it could\nbe just misunderstanding for a prolonged period of time. It's not explained to religious. Just like a lack of integrity. It's just like you have to\nlike talk through that shit. Like, just be honest with each other. - Take some MDMA, or\nreally get down to it. - Drugs solve everything.\n(Craig chuckles) If you've learned anything\nfrom this conversation. I've actually haven't done MDMA yet. People say that that's\nsomething I would enjoy a lot cause my brain is I think natural on MDMA. - I'd recommend it for sure. - [Lex] For sure. All right. - Is that what you did with Gabby? Okay, nevermind. - She drugged me. (laughter) - In general, why is there\nalways seems to be drama in the jiu-jitsu world? Like outside of what's going on here. Or is that just, - I think it's universal to anything. - [Lex] Drama's everywhere? And then drama rises to the surface. - Drama makes the money. - [Lex] Yeah. I wish there was a little bit less. You have a bunch of-- Like, we mentioned some of them. You have a bunch of instructionals out. What are some interesting things\nthat you're looking forward to like exploring in terms of teaching? So, \"Just Stand Up\" is your\nmost recent one, right? Yeah. You also have one called, \"Power Bottom, An Inclusive Modern\nApproach to the Guard.\" (light chuckling) - [Craig] Yep. Yep. - [Lex] What are some other ones? - [Craig] \"False Reap Allegations\" - \"False Reap Allegations\", yeah. By the way people talk\nabout \"Power Bottom\", again, hilarious title. But they say it's a\nreally good instructional, unlike the guard. - Yeah, I try to at least\nbe innovative, you know? Like, everyone else I\nfeel like's ripping off John and Gordon, putting\nsome sort of slant on that. So, I'm trying to take sort\nof a different approach. I think you can actively\ninfluence the sport with what you release\ncause people are gonna try to emulate that. So, I think those type of instructionals, \"Just Stand Up\", \"Power Bottom,\" like approaching the sport differently, I think definitely has\na positive impact on how people play the game. - Are you working on something now? - Probably a fundamentals course. Just cause we're bringing out, we've got the white\nbelt program coming in, so I'm trying to develop\na fundamentals course along the line of the\nconstraint based learning stuff we were talking about today. Like, a way to approach\nlearning as a beginner to sort of speed up the process a bit and not make it as so technique dense. At least have it a bit more fun. - And focusing in on just like, examples of problems to solve. - Exactly, yeah. Approaching jiu-jitsu, learning that way. Like, I mean, kids learn\nquick through games. I think adults are capable of that to a certain extent as well. - You're releasing that instructional on pre-match preparation?\n- Yes. - What other stuff? Do you ever think on a body lock pass? - Yeah, I have a body\nlock or Rody lock DVD, or instructional. Yeah, I had the pre-match\nritual coming out. I also have, I'm filming, \"How to Build\nAthleticism for Grappling.\" I'm just really trying to\ncapture different angles. Kind of like the same, you\nknow, what Craig's doing. Trying not to do the same\nthing that everybody else does. You know? There's a ton of wrestling, ton\nof jiu-jitsu instructionals. - And the steroid results are coming in. - Oh yeah, yeah. More plates, more dates. You know, Derek that runs that, hit me up for a blood panel test, like an impromptu thing. And I did it a few days ago, and I believe the results\nwill come out shortly. - Oh yeah? Do you know the results? - What are you betting on, Lex? - What do you think? It's hard to believe. I know. - Yeah, it's very, very impressive. (laughter) You're putting me in\nawkward position here. (laughter) Do you think you'll face Gordon soon? - I'm open to it. I don't know how soon, maybe in the next six months. I could see me facing\nhim before ADCC Worlds. - I think that's a great rivalry. I think it's a really interesting one. - It's fun for me. - Is there any chance that the two, the Soviet Union and Nazi\nGermany get back together? That DDS under whatever\nname gets back together? - No. Absolutely not. - Highly unlikely. I mean, we kind of did this to, you know, to back up Nicky Ryan and, you know, we're sticking with our guy. - So, what do you think? - Yeah, I think there's just\ntoo many personality conflicts for it to really ever work again. - Do you think there will\nalways be war in the world? - War?\n- Yeah. - Oh yeah. I think from the beginning of time, it's been, you know, some kind\nof war, some kind of battle. Controversy, it's what\nhelps people evolve. - Until AI, super intelligent AI becomes way more powerful than humans. And humbles all of us with its\npower before it destroys us. - Well, until it runs outta batteries. (laughter) You guys are screwed. (laughter) - Just unplug it. - That's awesome. I'm really fortunate to be\nable to hang out with you, to train with you. And thank you so much for talking today. This was-- - All right. - That's the best ending.
