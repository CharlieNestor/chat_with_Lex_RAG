We had a guy, (Lex laughing) - [Lex] Yeah. - We had a guy that came in. He was business guy. Came in with his suitcase\nand his tie up like that. And he's in his lunch hour. He's in his lunch hour, right? So gotta be quick. - [Lex] Yeah. (laughs) - So he comes in and he goes through. He's working his way through\nthe whole of the British team. (Lex laughing) We're all lined up, right? Ten minutes later, he's\ntying his tie up like that, and, oh, back to work, like that. Imagine him sitting behind\nhis desk and his computer. - Yeah, yeah. - [Neil] I'm glad he didn't get out. (Lex and Neil laughing) - Who do you think wins,\nYamashita versus Riner? - I think Yamashita, but. - Wait, whoa whoa whoa! You think Yamashita beats Teddy Riner? - I think so. - Strong words. The following is a\nconversation with Neil Adams, a legend in the sport of judo. He is a World Champion, two-time Olympic silver medalist, five time European champion, and often referred to\nas the voice of judo, commentating all the major events, World Championships and Olympic Games, highlighting the drama, the triumph, the artistry of the sport of judo, making fans like me feel the biggest wins, the biggest losses, the\nsurprise turns of fortune, the dominance of champions\ncoming to an end, and new champions made, always speaking from the heart.

      "section": "1980 Olympics",
      "text": "You are a five-time European champion, World Champion, two-time\nOlympic silver medalist. Let's first go to the 1980 Olympics. Where was your mind? What was your preparation like? What was your strategy\nleading into that Olympics? - That was my first Olympic Games, so my preparation was\na little bit different to how it was the '84 and\nthe '88 Olympic Games. And I'd kind of done part\nof the preparation as well for '76 Olympic Games. I wasn't quite old enough for those, but I was first reserve. So in 1980, I'd had four years' build up, and I was hungry, and I was one of these young athletes, and I see them so often\nnow that was developing, and, you know, full of. I won't say I was full of myself, but I was certainly\nconfident of my ability, and I wanted to conquer the world. And I'd had a couple\nof really tight matches with the current Olympic World Champion, so I knew that there was a possibility that I could get there\nfor the '80 Olympics. So building up to the 80\nOlympics was quite interesting because I was kind of\ncoming through the weights and I was halfway in between\nthe 71 kilos weight category and the higher weight\ncategory of 78 kilograms. And I had got third place at\nthe '79 World Championships the weight below, fought the whole year at\nthe higher weight category, didn't lose a contest, so I'd beaten everybody in the world. And then I had to make decision as to whether to drop to the weight below because I was seeded in the weight below. It was a different seeding then, so I decided to drop into the weight below because I was seeded in the top four. And as it happens, I think it was probably\nthe worst decision I made. (Lex laughing) Well, simply because, I mean, it was the only contest that I lost was the final of the\nOlympic Games in that year. - So you're a young kid, what, like 19, 20 at that time? - Yeah.\n- Full of confidence, vigor. So the decision to cut weight, how hard was it for you to cut\nweight to the 71 kg division? - I've got to say that it was the hardest, because as I was going up, I was, you know, it was 73, then it was 74 kilos, 75. So I was moving through\nthe weight category. It wasn't like I was stuck in the middle and then I dropped the\nodd time to compete. It was literally going up in\nweight by a kilo every month. And then by the time I came to a month or two before the Olympics,\nit was really hard. Fought the European championships at the higher weight\ncategory and won that. And so everybody that was\non the Olympic were rostrum at the Olympic Games was on my rostrum at the\nEuropean Championships. So was it a mistake? Yeah, because I didn't\nhave my diet sorted out. My nutrition was appalling. And when I, you know, it wasn't as kind of readily available as it is now for the nutrition. And I would say that if\nanything lost me that final, other than the fact that I was fighting\nsomebody who was terrific, you know, he was an\nexcellent, brilliant athlete, but it definitely didn't help that my nutrition was not very good. - Okay, so you lost to Ezio Gamba. There's probably a lot\nof that we could say about that particular match. Maybe, let's zoom in. What were your strengths and weaknesses, judo-wise in that Olympics? You said you haven't\nreally lost the match. You won the European\nChampionship leading into it, but if you had weak spots, okay, you already said diet, but specifically on the\nmat in terms of judo. - I think that none of\nthe fights lasted time going into the final, you know, so I won fairly quickly. And every match by ippon,\nyou know, way before time. - Do you remember how, do you remember how you won the matches? - I won them by throw, a couple of throws for ippon, and then armlock for ippon. Semifinal was an armlock against\nthe East German, Krueger. And, yeah, I was flying through. - What were the throws? Do you remember? - Tai otoshi, uchi mata, my favorite kind of tokui waza, were my favorite throws. And then juji gatame as well, which was a juji gatame roll, against an East German\nwho I'd beaten before, but always had a really tough match, but managed to beat him well. - So you had a beautiful\nexhibition of Japanese-type judo in the first two matches. You threw people, and then\nyou also did the newaza, you armbarred a person. Great, so going into the final, what are the weaknesses\ngoing into the final against the Italian? - Like I say, taking nothing away from\nhim as a great athlete and a brilliant judo man, and left, which wasn't good for me. That was a definite no, because I hated fighting lefties. Still do, but I'll tell\nyou why in a minute. - [Lex] Great. - It's one of those. But I think as I went through the contest, we had an eight-hour break from\nthe semifinal to the final. They took us back to the Olympic Village, then we had to come back in, and then we had to start a warm up again, so I kind of lost my momentum. I had to start again,\nand I never, I didn't. I just didn't. I had a job to get going. I got halfway through, started to rescue a dying match, and I was kind of one step, half a step behind all the way through, so never really got into it. - So why do you hate fighting lefties? And lefties are, we should say, overrepresented in terms\nof the high ranks of judo. I don't know why that is. - Well, you know, the\nthing is about a lefty is a lefty will have more opportunity to fight right-handers, because, I mean, 70% of the population are\nright-handers, 30% left. So they get to fight more right-handers, and it's just a fact, that happens. So the thing that they hate\nis fighting left against left. They don't like it, left against left, whereas a right-hander will\ngo right against right. But the opposite is awkward for me because just simply I like\nto go onto the sleeve, and then I like to dominate the grips. But the actual angle of the opponent wasn't what I wanted, so I had to work hard,\nreally hard against it. - What happened in that match? - It was a split decision in the end. And so to lose an Olympic final on a split decision is pretty, you know, it's something that's still on my mind. And I think that it's a strange one because I can still wake up, that one and four years\nlater at the Olympics, because I was silver medalist at the Olympics four years later as well. And, yeah, it still haunts me. - Do you sometimes wake up and think like, \"Man, I should have eaten better.\" - Yeah. - Or maybe a specific\ngrip that you're like, \"Ah, I shouldn't have taken that grip.\" - I do. I mean, the diet side of it, it's difficult to really\nadmit that, isn't it? That you went to an Olympic Games and the one thing that you\nreally sucked at, right, was one of the most important things now at world-level sport, where you've got the nutrition. We've got it. You would think that most\npeople have got it sorted, but there's still people making mistakes and still people that haven't\ngot it totally sorted. - And then there's people\nlike Travis Stevens, who I think doesn't care. He'll just have atrocious nutrition and he just makes it work. I think the way he spoke about it is you can't always control nutrition, so it's best to get good\nat having crappy nutrition. - That's a good way of looking at it. I never, yeah, maybe that's what I did. - Exactly, exactly.\n(Neil laughing) Do you remember what you were eating? Are we talking about like candy, or? - Yeah, well, I got a sweet tooth in, but it wasn't really. I mean,\nI didn't have a lot of money at that particular time either, so the diet wasn't steak\nand good nutritional salads and things like that. I did what I thought was best without proper advice. And the crazy thing is that I\nhad such good advice as well when it came to kind of fitness training and things like that. We're quite ahead of our time, and we really had it nailed as far as the conditioning was concerned. The judo training as\nwell was way in advance because I was a good trainer and I trained more than most. I would, I can honestly say that. And it probably got me away with a lot. - Where was your mind, so mental preparation,\ngoing into that Olympics? You said you were confident, but is there some preparation\naspect behind that confidence? - I think in the early days, I didn't think I was going to lose. I never thought it was possible to lose. And I think that I went into\nevery contest expecting to win. So when it didn't quite go my way, I didn't lose that many contests, so the only ones I lost were in the final of\nthe World Championships or in the final of the Olympic Games. So I didn't lose that many. I never lost a European title. I had seven golds at\nEuropean Championships, five Seniors, two at\nJuniors under twenties, and I never lost a final, so it was. And then I only lost\ntwo on a split decision, so it was, I didn't lose that many. And my attitude was that\nI wasn't going to lose and I couldn't lose, so I was always surprised when I did, when something happened. - In \"Neil Adams, A Life in Judo,\" written in 1986, you wrote, \"Ever since I can remember, I have wanted to win. It wasn't the ordinary\nfeeling that children have when they take part in their first primary school\nsack race on a grass track, or even the keen determination of a young swimmer prepared to train early in the cold winter mornings in order to make it into the county side. With me, the desire to\nwin was, and still is, as much a part of me as my arms and legs. In other words, it wasn't something I\nlearned as I grew older, but rather was deeply rooted in me. Perhaps this competitive instinct\nis the greatest difference between my public image and\nthe view from the inside.\" So people see the kindness,\nthe warmth you have, the charisma, the excitement, but there's this big\ndrive to win inside you. So what's behind that? Can you just speak to that drive to win and how that contributed to\nyour competitive journey? - [Neil] When I look back now. - There's a lot of years\nago, we should say. - It is a lot of years ago. - Is that true or are\nwe just being poetic? - It's not far off. No, it's not, when I think about it now, because I'd like to think that\nI'm a different person now. And since I've kind of calmed down, I see athletes now, and I see them, and their kind of arrogance. They're walking. It's a strut, you know, and it's a kind of a confidence, isn't it? And as we're older and\nas I've become older, I've calmed down. But, you know, it doesn't\nmatter what I'm doing. It's still that will to win, and I'm much better at\nmasking it now if I don't. But it still bothers me as much. - You're talking about, I don't know, even just\nstupid, silly things, like, I don't know, a game of pool or something\nlike this, or just anything? - Yeah, I'm still trying to win. Like so my son loves to, he loves to play me at bowls, because I'm useless, and I just can't throw a straight bowl. So he loves playing me at that, but it bugs me that I'm not better, and there are certain things that I do. (Lex laughing) It really bugs me when I'm not good at it. And I guess it's one of the reasons that, long after I'd finished competition, judo, people still want to train with you, and even at kind of an\nolder age, even now, if I do it in a seminar, or they're still, \"Do you still do, do you want to still go? And can I feel it?\" And one of the things\nthat's in me is that I just, all the way up to 40 years of age, so from 30, when I finished competition, up to 40, I could still train with the best, and I could still go with anybody. And then when 40 hit, kind of things started\nto fall off a little bit, and I used to get either my\nhips or my legs and my knees, and I realized that I\nhad to pick my practices, and that rankled as well. And I had to then just\ncalm it down a little bit. Otherwise I was going to be injured, and I was going to be, you know, it's not a good thing\nwhen you're getting older and you've still got the\nsame competitive mind, but things change. - So it's still there. You get on the mat,\nprobably even now, right? You get on the mat with a World Champion. You still, the current World Champion, there's still a little part of you. - Oh, yeah, yeah. - Could I still toss this guy? Kids these days are soft. (laughs) - I do think, well, you know what? Some of these athletes, I mean, I give you a prime example, right? Is Ilias Iliadis, all right? I mean, he is a monster, right? And you just, of course you couldn't, because just at 60\nsomething, you couldn't. But you like to think that you could. - Yeah, you could. You never know. You'll never find out. - You know what you would do? What you can do is you\ncan cause them problems and they feel it immediately, but you'd last a minute, you know. - So you've trained with Ilias Iliadis. I've gotten a chance to\ntrain with him as well. He's a really nice guy, really great. - He's a good guy. He trained with me. We were training together. Every hotel that we used to go into, we'd end up in the gym\ntogether and we'd train. And this one time he was in there and he just wanted somebody\nto grab and grip hold of. And so we ended up doing\nthis kind of grappling in the middle of the people\ndoing weight training and different things, watching these two madmen doing. I'm glad we weren't on a\nmat at that particular time, but good fun. - What do you think about that guy? He, like you, achieved a lot of success when he was young. - 17, you imagine that? 17, 18 years of age, and he's able to compete with the men. There's not many men can do that. And it doesn't happen very often. It happens later with the men, and often they're not\nphysically as developed as they, so from me, for example, I fought Nevzorov who was World and Olympic Champion. He was the current World Olympic Champion. They sent me to the European\nChampionship Senior at 17. That doesn't happen very often. And I fought. I pulled Nevzorov, so I fought Nevzorov. And I had him really worried, because he expected, without a doubt, to come out, throw this kid, a junior. - He was thick and shredded. - He was shredded. There's a picture of him in his judogi, and his judogi is just cut, and he looks the business, and there's me in this baggy, - [Lex] Skinny kid. - Yeah, skinny kid\ninside this baggy thing. And the thing was, is that the more he tried, and the harder he tried, and the more he panicked, the further it went away from him. And so, you know, of course he got the decision at the end, and deservedly, but I worried him, and so for me, that was a massive step forward, because a year later I\nwas starting to fill out, and two years later I was competing for the Olympic title, so.\n- I don't know if I remember, but Ilias Iliadis is interesting, because even at 17, I feel like he was doing big throws, like literally lifting them with the hips. - Just rips them out the ground. And I was saying to Niki, my wife, she said, \"What would you do now that was different than\nthe way you did then?\" And I said, \"I never had any pickups.\" I didn't, that's not what we did, but you have a look at the young Ukraines or the the young Russians or the young Eastern Bloc Mongolians, and they're ripping people out the ground. I mean, it's just different style of judo, and it just looks different. But now they're starting to do traditional-style judo as well."

      "text": "- So can you speak to that? What are the different styles of judo? So for you, you mentioned\nuchi mata, tai otoshi, these, how would you describe them? They're like these effortless, less lifting off the ground and power and strength and explosion, and more timing and position, movement. - Yeah, momentum. - Momentum, all this kind of stuff that's more traditionally associated with Japanese judo, because for Japanese judo, the traditional judo, you're supposed to throw people in a big way without much effort. - And of course, 1990, we saw the introduction of all\nthese Eastern Bloc countries. There were so many more, I mean, it was Soviet Union when I was competing. And then, of course, in\n1990, everything changed. And then there were so many\nmore of them out there, different countries, that their wrestling styles\nwere introduced into judo. Put a jacket on them,\nand let's get into judo. So judo kind of changed shape. It changed shape from\nthis upright, standing, and having to know the technicalities of how to get a body\nthat's weighing 14 stone, or whatever it is, up into the air, and using the momentum and the balance and the direction and the skill to do that and knowing how to do it\nand how to use movement. And then you get the wrestlers, and the leg picks, and the double-leg,\nsingle-leg, double-legs. By 1995, judo was bent over. It was the IOC that went to IJF, International Judo\nFederation, and they said, \"You've got to change this, or we're just going to\nhave one wrestling style. It looks like wrestling\nwith judo jackets on, so you either change it or we're going to take one of you out.\" - By the way, we should sort of clarify. When we say people are bent over, that's usually how you\nsee freestyle wrestling. Wrestlers are more bent over\nto defend the legs and so on. And traditional judo\npeople are more standing up because that's the position for which you can do the big throws and all that kind of stuff. But I think the other case\nto make for banning leg grabs is a lot of people are\nusing it for stalling and not for beautiful big throws and all that kind of stuff. So it's not just not to make\nit different from wrestling. It's also like you want\nto maximize the amount of epic throws and dynamic judo and exciting stuff to watch. - Win by judo, not by wrestling. And I think that the ones\nthat were shouting about it were the wrestlers, right? Because they like to compete with both. They want to do both. They want to do their wrestling matches and then come into judo. So basically, I mean, what we've said is they learn to do judo and there's nothing stopping you then from doing both, right? But not from the other way around. All right, so rules always\ndictate development. They'll always dictate\nwhich direction it goes. So if you introduce a rule that states that you cannot dive at\nthe legs and just pick up, then you'll have to do it standing up. And also it increases the possibility of defense with the\nhips, because actually, good defense judo-wise, standing up, is with the hips as opposed\nto sticking your arms out and then sticking your backsides\nout there just to defend. All right? So if you attack me and I move\nmy body in the wrong place, so I'm in the wrong\nplace at the right time, so you don't hit the right target. And then also I use my hips, so again, it's a form of judo that was being lost. So now we got it back. - So let's go there. Let's speak about judo as if we're talking to a\ngroup of five year olds. So what is judo? What are some defining\ncharacteristics of judo as a sport, as a way, as a martial\nart, as a way of life, all that kind of stuff? - I think, when you say\nit as a way of life, I mean, I think the great\nadvantage that we have in judo, my young grandson, so\nI got two little boys that are three and a half years of age. They love going to our dojo. They love it, you know, so dojo was the first word that they used. It was one of the first. So when they come see\nus, see my wife and I, you know, it's like dojo. It's not grandma, granddad,\nyou know, it's dojo. So dojo, they take their\nshoes off going into the dojo, so they have respect for where they're at, and I think it has that\nkind of feeling that, like, I tried to build my dojo\nwith a feeling of reverence. It's kind of almost peaceful, you know? So I'm not religious, I'm\nnot a religious person, but I like going to old churches, because when I go into an old church, it doesn't matter what the\nreligion within the church, but there's a reverence in there. - Reverence is a good word. It feels like a really special place. No matter which dojo you go to, it's just you bow and there's a calmness\nbefore the storm of battle or whatever it is. (laughs) - And respect, look at the respect. We were just talking about it\njust before we came on air. We were just saying that\nwe very, very seldom do we have a situation where there is animosity\nother than them fighting. So I'm not saying that\nthey don't fight each other because sometimes it\ndoes turn into a brawl. And at the end, two people bow off and show their respect. And one of the things, so a champion, I see people winning events,\nand they're good judoka, they're excellent. They win World Championships, might even win the Olympic Games. But a great champion for\nme is somebody who treats, who does the right thing when they lose. So when you see them lose, that's when you see the true them. And actually, that was one of the biggest things that\nI had to really cope with. When I lost that Olympic Games in Moscow and also the one in Los Angeles, the hardest thing is when\nthe microphone is in there and you've got to be respectful and nice, and the hardest thing is to smile. But actually, some of the\ngreat champions, they'll go, \"That's just one match.\" I remember we've got one\ngreat champion, Agbegnenou. She's a five-time World Champion. She's an Olympic champion. She's favorite as well to\nget this Olympic gold medal. French, what a great champion she is, because she lost one of the matches. I mean, she'd come back, and she'd given birth, come back after giving birth, and everybody was going, \"Well, will she?\" And then she lost one of the matches on the way through, and she said, \"Don't be upset, you\nknow, it's just one match. It's just one contest. Next time I'm going to put it right.\" And she did put it right, and now she's back up there and she won the world title back. So these are great champions for me. - Yeah, I mean, that's\nthe right way to see it. But it's also tragic to lose the Olympic Games, you know. - Twice. (Neil laughing) Yes, it is tragic. And I do have sleepless nights. - I mean, that's the magic\nof the Olympic Games. Anything can happen. And your 1980 Olympics were\nvery different from the 1984. But if we just linger on the '80, and just your, where we're talking about, how much you wanted to win."

      "section": "Winning",
      "text": "Do you love winning or hate losing more? - I hate losing more, but I love winning. When I won the world title a year later and I had no doubt when\nI went into that day that I was going to be World Champion. No doubt. - So you won the '81 World Championship. - At the higher weight. - At the higher, the 78? - [Neil] Yes. - Kg. Actually, can we go there? What was going through your mind? You ended up armbarring\na Japanese fighter. I talked to Jimmy Pedro,\na friend of yours, somebody who said you were a\nmentor to him for many years, and he told me a bunch of\ndifferent questions to ask you. But he said that was\na really special time. That was a really special\ndominant run you had, and especially finishing with an armbar against as a Japanese player. So take me through that. What do you remember from that? - I think that it was,\nso my weight was better, I didn't have to lose weight. That was one thing. So the nutritional side\nwasn't as important, but probably it still wasn't\nas good as it could be, my nutrition. Although it was getting better and I was trying to eat the\nright things at the right time, but I still trained really well and I was so confident there going into that World Championships\nthat I could win it. I had no doubt in my mind\nthat I was going to win. But obviously, corner of\nyour mind you're thinking, \"Just don't make mistakes.\" But this is the incredible thing is that once you start to ask, I see contests change direction when I'm commentating, so I can see somebody who's in there just going forward, just trying to win. And that's a difference to somebody who's trying not to lose. And there's two different\nways there, you know, so sometimes when you, so when I was World Champion, then I had a period of time where every time I stepped out there, I was really afraid of losing. And I think that that's\nwhat happens later on in your competitive career. You know, the great champions\nmanaged to come through that. Teddy Riner is one of\nthose, you know, he just, he puts it out there and\nhe keeps beating them, so they can't take it away from him. You know, it's fantastic. - So stepping on the mat every single encounter\nyou're trying to win, you're looking for the grips, and with the intention to throw, throw big even when\nyou're ahead on points, all that kind of stuff. - That's a really good point, is that if you go ahead in a match and you look at the clock. It depends when you go ahead. So sometimes you can go\nahead in the first minute and you've still got three minutes to go. So I see the ones then that\ngo into, I don't want to lose, because they go into defensive mode. And then sometimes they\ncan lose it on penalties or something can go wrong and the other one comes on strong and then they can sneak the contest. And so it's really difficult. But when I was coaching, I was trying to always\nencourage that positive attitude for the full four minutes,\nfive minutes then. - I've competed a lot\nin judo and jiu-jitsu. I've always hated that part of myself. When I'm up on points by a lot, you look at the clock, and it's what you do when\nyou look at the clock, - I see. (laughs) - Minute and a half, you're really tired, and you kind of quit. You just defend. Yeah, and I hated that part about myself. - It's saying, \"Don't do it.\" - Well, as opposed to just go out in judo, that's for a big throw. Just keep going for the throw. In jiu-jitsu, it's go for the submission, like throw caution, like win in the real way versus on points. And I hated that part of myself. I mean, mostly underneath that is cowardice induced by exhaustion. - Exhaustion's the one, isn't it? But it is, isn't it? It's a mindset as well. So actually trying to get your mind positive\nall the way through. So, I mean, if you listen, when I commentate, is I say, I hope that they don't change the mindset and that they keep on and they are going forward all the time. And actually they're then\nmore difficult to catch. We had one just a couple of weeks ago, and he lost in the final\nsecond of the contest. Lost the final. He was the only one to score. He got penalized all the\nway up, two seconds to go, and stepped out of the area. But he went like that, thinking the bell was just going, and the bell went one second\nafter he actually stepped out. So he got penalized, lost the match, and lost all of the\npoints for qualification. So it was, you know,\nthat's paying high price. That's paying high price. - Yeah. I mean, there's a thin\nline between triumph and tragedy in those competitions, but especially at the Olympic Games. So let's just stick on\n'81 World Championship. What did it feel like to\nwin that World Championship? And also getting an armbar\nagainst a Japanese player. Jimmy told me your arms were exhausted. - Yeah, I mean, you just. The thing is sometimes when you're going, when it's competitive as well. Ours is a different intensity to jiu-jitsu where you can take time a little bit. Ours is bang. It's transitioning from standing down. You've got 10, 15 seconds to go in there. You go in 100%. It's a bit like running\nfull-out for 10 seconds, and then you've got to decide then, especially if they're defending it, whether you let it go, because when you get up\nand your forearms are blown and you've got lactic acid in there and you've still got to\ngrip up because, remember, ours is about gripping\nas well on the jacket. So if you can't grip up, then\nyou can't gain the advantage, then they can throw you. So you have to decide. So I had a massive attack on him, and we changed directions\nfour or five times, and then I wasn't going to let him go, but I still, when I was turning him there, I had to decide, am I going to go all\nout for this and just, or there has been occasions when I've kind of released\nit to just, you know, if I got a minute to go,\nand just lock out, yeah. - So what you're saying on the feet, there was a change of direction of all different kinds of attempts, and then you went to the ground. - [Neil] Yeah. - So what was that? Do you remember that\ndecision of like, okay, am I gonna finish this? - Yeah, I knew it. I just, as soon as I climbed his back, and then I thought, he's not going. He's not gonna. I'm not gonna let him up, you know, so I was just changing. - [Lex] Little voice in your head? - Something in my head\nwas going, \"Don't, don't. You know, just stick on him.\" And then it's always\nabout pressure on the arm, and I just, you know, and of course he was like that, defending. He was almost total bridge\ntrying to get out of it. - Did it start in turtle? And like, did you flip? - It started in turtle\nbecause I did an attack, came back out of the attack, and then he went on to his front, and then I was on his back, and then I started the whole thing. - [Lex] Saw an opening\nand you just went for it? - Just, it was an automatic transition. So, I mean, the transitions\nare what we teach, you know, because the ones that are quicker down with the transitions are\nthe ones that catch it. That's our newaza. You know, our groundwork is the transition from standing down to ground. It's very, you know, we don't have a situation where you can kind of work your way in. You are in or you're not in. You're standing, you know? So you've got to make sure that you're in. And so I had, I was just on his back like a leech, and I never let him go. - So that's where the armbars, that's where the attacks on the ground, which is called newaza, happens is it? In the transition. - [Neil] Yes. - At that level, at that\nhigh, world-class level. - Yeah, I mean, he was no muggy, though. I think he just got third place in the All-Japan Championships, which is all weight categories. So he wasn't a mug. He was strong. I'd fought him once before, and I knew, he was a lefty as well, which was really awkward for me. - Did it feel good? - Better for me than him. It did. It felt amazing, because it was almost\nlike all these things, disappointments and everything had kind of come to this one point where I was at last kind\nof Champion of the World. It's everything I said as a kid that I had no idea how difficult\nit was gonna be, you know? So as a kid, as a 14-year-old kid, I remember saying, \"I'm gonna be World Champion. I'm gonna be the best in the world.\" I had no idea how difficult\nthat was gonna be. - Well, there's wisdom to that, right? Like, there's power\nand stupidity of youth. - I like that. - Just like, I'm gonna be a World Champ. I'm gonna win this without\nknowing how hard it is. And then once you go after it, it's you're trapped. You're gonna have to do the work. - Yeah, well, I mean, you see it a lot with parents as well. You know, parents, our little Johnny is, he's amazing, and he's\nthis, that, and the other. And they have no idea what's out there. I remember the very first\ntime I stepped out, 1974, into the European Cadets, and I remember that we were fighting. I'd only ever fought in Great Britain. I was the top, I was\nunbeaten in the juniors, kids, and went out there, and there were these\ndifferent fighters out there that were treating me with total disdain. And I remember thinking, how dare they, you know? And I realized when I\ncame back from that event, there's other people out there. There's just a whole, and there are different levels of. Majority of people are just not informed as to what's out there and the different levels\nthat there are out there. - Do you remember like a certain opponent that for the first time,\nyou felt like, holy shit? - [Neil] Yeah. - Like somebody just gripped you up and you're like, this is, there's another level to this game. - Ezio was one of them, and I fought him, you know, and I beat him in the\nEuropean Championships. I beat him two times, and then lost to him in the Olympic Games two months after I'd beaten him in\nthe European Championship. - Wow. - Yeah, yeah. So that made it even\nmore difficult, right? - That's literally your\nnemesis there, wow. - Yeah, so that made it more difficult. And so Ezio was one, and getting hold of, I remember getting hold\nof Nishida of Japan, and he had me going up and down, and I just, I thought, wow, this guy is amazing, and I'd never fought, first time I ever fought\nJapanese in a major tournament, and I felt the danger. I always talk about the danger when we go out to Japan to train. I could go probably months\nwithout getting thrown in training here in Europe. And I go to Japan, and everybody's thrown you, and that's difficult to accept. And the reason that kind of danger and that kind of feeling of danger is something that puts a real edge on. So that was the first time, when I got a hold of Nishida, I thought, \"Oh, my God.\" This guy, it didn't matter which way he was turning like that. He had me stretched out, and I thought, I want to do this. And then I ended up\nfighting him again in Japan. - So that feeling of danger\nis really interesting. Like, I've, you know, I did randori with a lot\nof world-class people from different parts of the world, including Ilias Iliadis. And there's certain part,\nlike Eastern European judo, you feel like you're screwed\nthe whole way through. Like the gripping, you really\nfeel it in the gripping. - It's the gripping that does it. - But in with Japanese, like really good Japanese-style judoka, you don't, it's like, it's a terrifying calmness, but at least the experiences I've had, you don't really feel it in the gripping. You just feel like anywhere you step, you're getting thrown. It's a different. - It's a different thing isn't it? - It's a different thing. - So, I mean, mine was kind of a mixture. I liked it to be a\nmixture, because there was, the gripping is definitely the key point. So if you get high-level\nguys that are gripping up, and I always used to\nput this to the referees when we were doing referee seminars when we first started them. And I'd say, how many? Because, like, they would referee to their understanding of the match. So they were penalizing for\ncertain grips that were, you know, and actually, so as an ex-athlete, at high-level, I would say, \"Have you ever\ngripped up with high-level?\" All right. Because if you haven't, you need to do it, because then you will understand why they do certain things with the grips, because these guys are like, when somebody grips you, and you think, you know you're going to go. When Iliadis puts his arm\nover your back, all right, and you know you're\ngoing to go up and over, you know you're going to go\nover. You know, that's it. - It's a cool feeling. - Not for me. (laughs) - Well, I understand. But it's like, I mean, because it's not. It feels way more powerful than it should. - Yeah. - It's weird. I don't know. You want to attribute it to strength and all that kind of stuff. I mean, people say you have\nimmense upper body strength, but it's probably something else. It's like technique. It's some kind of weird. - It's a mix of everything. - Just like something hardened\nthrough lots of battles and randori and that kind of stuff. - [Neil] Yeah. - But it's cool that\nhumans are able to generate that kind of power. It's cool. - When I was, '84 Olympics. But I'm just gonna go\nthere now, just quickly. But there was, we had a freestyle wrestler. He's American, actually, but\nhe had English nationality. So he competed for,\nNoel Loban, his name is, and he competed for Great Britain. He got third place at the Olympics in '84. But he was training. We were training at Budokwai,\nand he was training. He came to do some judo,\nand he put jacket on. And of course, he was training with\nsome of the lower levels, and he was really handling himself well. And then he said, \"I need to feel,\" you know, when we did randori, so he did some randori with me, and I immediately thought, I gotta catch it. I gotta stop single leg and double leg. Because he was really quick, right? So strong as well, 90-something kilos. He was like, you know, he's a big guy. So I caught his sleeve, immediately caught and controlled him, and then he couldn't start, right? So he said, \"I needed\nto feel the difference.\" So then I thought, I better reciprocate this. So I said, well, you know, so we did the randori and I\nthrew him a couple of times. He said, \"I'm really glad we did that.\" So then I said, \"I need to\nfeel the difference as well.\" So we take the jackets off. So we took the jackets off. And he was a nightmare. This guy was a nightmare. And, like a monster, you know, he was like, single legging me, and it was just totally different. So it was like the jacket\nmakes a massive difference, huge difference to something. And people think it's just\na jacket that we're wearing, but it isn't. It's our only tool, actually. - Yeah, and it's control. I mean, it's a way of establishing control over another body. And it's a whole art form and a science. And I don't even know if\nyou understand it, really. You understand it sort of\nsubconsciously through time. - [Neil] Yeah. - Because there is so much involved, because pulling on one part of the jacket pulls other parts of the jacket, and like the physics of that is probably insane to understand. - It's absolutely insane. And then they changed the\nrules for a little while and they changed the rules\nso that you couldn't hold, certain grips were not allowed. They only allowed certain amount of time. And there were a lot\nof penalties for them. And then they had some of the ex-fighters into the referee commission. And so we were pushing for just let them grip,\nbecause that's our game. That's what makes us different. Again, if grip up with somebody. So they were on about Teddy Riner. Teddy Riner comes out, takes a sleeve, big arm over the top, and then he throws people. So they were saying, \"Yeah, but stop.\" You can't stop him doing it. This guy is six-foot nine, and he is built like Goliath, you know? - Yeah. - And not only that,\nhe's skillful as well. And he's got that mentality of a winner. He has got that mentality\nof a winner there. He just wins important matches. - And he goes over the top of the grip. Where does that land\nnow in terms of rules? Over the top? Because those are some of the most epic, awesome types of grips, just like over the top, just big grab. - Yeah, well, as long\nas they throw from it, so they can take any grip as long as you move them\nand then catch them, kind of action-reaction, really. You know, as long as you\ncatch them on the move, then you can do it. - So as long as you're\nnot using it to stall or that kind of stuff. - Yeah, you can't block out. So, I mean, so for example, if I've got dominant grip on you, and I just block out, and I just stop you attacking me. So then what? I get you three penalties, get you off, and you haven't done an attack. So you've got to stop that. You can't have that. - Yeah, yeah, definitely."

      "text": "You were the favorite to\nwin the 1984 Olympics, but you got silver. I watched that match several times. You probably have it playing in your head. So there is a nice change of\ndirection by your opponent, German, Frank Wieneke. - [Neil] Yeah. - It was a fake right uchi mata, and then to a left drop seoi nage. How did that loss feel? - Devastating is not enough really, because, you know, the strange thing was\ncoming into that Olympics, I was tired, really tired. So my mental state wasn't the best, wasn't certainly the same as it was coming into the previous. And I remember thinking, I just need to get this over with, and then I'm going to have a break and just have a rest. And that's totally the wrong attitude. It's just not good for\ngoing into an Olympic Games. And so I was coming in there\nwith a different mindset. And I remember every match that I had, I was winning well, but I was winning with\na struggle, you know, it was really not. I'd fought Nowak, and I\nwas pretty, of France, who was one of the strongest physically, that was in the quarterfinals. I beat Brett Barron by an ippon. I'd armlocked him. I won my first match by ippon as well. And then Michel Nowak I was fighting, of France, and I was lucky to win it. I was up. I would score on him, but I was like starting to defend, and just everything that\nI talked to you about, and then just about\nheld on, and then I won. So him and I were talking afterwards, some years afterwards, and he said, \"I was close, wasn't I?\" \"Yeah, but not close enough.\" (Lex laughing) I didn't mean it, but I had to say it. - [Lex] Of course, of course. - And no, he was right, and it was one of those. So it's through to the semifinal. I had fought Lescak in the semifinal, and I'd fought him in the\nsemifinal of the Worlds as well. I'd never gone time with him. I'd always beaten him\nfairly easily and by ippon, and that went time. So I was just glad to get it done. And I was in the final then against Frank Wieneke of Germany. And I'd beaten Wieneke before, but he was just a young\nGerman coming through. And when I started the final, I thought, right, I've just, and I started, all my techniques just\nthat little bit off. Nothing was coordinated. It was just, I can't really explain why\nit was just a little bit off. I see it so often now with a lot of the guys that are going for second, third Olympic Games, and I see their technique\njust not quite there, and they're struggling, and I know when they're, you know, I know what they're going through and I kind of empathize with them. - Well, you were, it felt like you were\ndominating that final. - I dominated it. Yeah, I was winning. And actually, if it had\nanother minute and a half, it would have been all over and I would have been Olympic Champion and it would have been done. He wouldn't have batted an eyelid, because he would have fought\nme really, really well, and he would have, you know, we talked about it afterwards, and he said, \"It was\njust my good day for me.\" And he knows, he was very respectful. This guy is very respectful. - He was surprised almost. I mean, not almost. He was very surprised and celebrating. - Yeah, jumping up and down. And, you can look at that, can't you go, well, it wasn't ippon, but\nwould I had got it back? I don't know. I think that actually\ntaking the pressure off, because that was another thing as well, pressure of being favorite, and I see that with a lot of\nthem. And the great champions, the ones that keep coming through. Krpalek, there's a guy. He can look very ordinary, and then comes the big tournament, and he'll win it. - The tragedy of the Olympic Games. I mean, you were the favorite. And just like that, like\nsplit moment, you lost it. - Split moment, devastating. And lived it probably not every day, but, Niki, my wife, will tell you that I've woken up in sweats, and I think they contributed as well, because I had a period of my life after where I was drinking too much, and I think kind of when I look back, kind of led into that kind\nof dark period of my life, and I never, ever, ever, did it go through my mind, anything else, but it definitely affected me. And I was on a downward kind of spiral in a lot of different ways, and would still even, you know, we have an amazing marriage, and we have an amazing family, and everything's great, but I still wake up sometimes, and I'll say, \"I've just\ndreamt, you know, that,\" and it's the same reoccurring dream where I'm trying to get somewhere and I'm trying to put it right, you know, and I've got this chance of putting this Olympic final right. You know, in this dream, I've\ngot a chance of doing it, but I can't get there and the traffic's stopping\nme or something stops me. And then I wake up and I'm sweating, and you think, \"What, after all this time, that's not possible.\" But it is, and it happens. - Yeah, I mean, in the match itself, there's that feeling\nfor me just watching it. Like you're going for throws, you're almost getting\nthere with the throws, and it's almost like he's going for a kind of crappy uchi mata and then you're just like\nstopping, you're blocking it. And all of a sudden, I mean, that's the beauty of the Olympics. He finds it in himself to switch like that against a favorite, against sort of the great British judoka, just finds the perfect drop seoi nage. - Well, you know, his\nteam doctor and coach, he came up to me afterwards and said, \"I'm just really sorry.\" And that's all they said\nis, \"I'm just really sorry.\" They were sorry, because the obvious sadness about that, and of course, everybody takes their, I went actually two and a half, was it, three weeks later, the German Open. So he had to compete in the\nGerman Open three weeks later. So I went over to fight him and beat him in the\nfinal of the German Open. And it didn't do anything for me, because it was a much tighter match. He was a lot closer. He had a lot more confidence coming in. So he fought me a lot differently. And then it was me pulling it back and just managing to win in the final, and I thought, \"Well, that might appease.\" It appeased nothing. Didn't do anything. - When you give your\nwhole life to judo, just, and your love of winning, that's crazy how much\nthe Olympic Games mean. - It means so much. And I think, but I've got to, and I've got to say this,\nand this is honestly, if it meant that if I'd\nhave won that Olympic Games and it had to change my life\ninto a different direction, which I probably would have not competed in the '88 Olympic Games then. All right, so if it had changed my life and then I didn't have, I didn't meet my wife, and I didn't have my\nfamily that I've got now. There's no, you know, I wouldn't swap that, what I've got now, for anything. - Well, part of the demons\nthat you've gotten to know because of those losses is part of probably the central reason that made you the man you are, a legend of the sport. You could have been not that, because an Olympic gold\nis just an Olympic gold. - Yeah. And it is, isn't it? And I think that there's\na lot of Olympic Champions and World Champions that win and then are forgotten. And I said to Niki, I said to my wife, I said, \"I don't want to be forgotten,\nand I want to be remembered, so I'm going to do\nanything, anything I do, if I'm going to do\ncommentary or whatever it is, or coaching, I want to do\ncoaching to a high level, and I want to commentate at a high level.\" I remember the first\ncommentary I ever did. It was terrible. And I just thought, \"I've\ngot to do better than this.\" And I thought, I just, \"I need to do it well, and I've got to do it professionally.\""

      "section": "Lessons from losing",
      "text": "- So in the book \"A Game of Throws,\" you have a chapter titled\n\"Lessons and Losing.\" So what are some of the lessons here? What are some of the deeper lessons you've pulled out of losing? - I think great champions are made up of the people that handle\nit in the right way. And you could say, \"Well,\nI don't like losing.\" And you could throw\nyour dummy out the pram and you can be a bad loser\nin front of everybody. And actually, people pick up\non that very, very quickly. You know what it's like\nin broadcasting, right? Somebody has a bad word\nto say about somebody. - [Lex] Yep. - Yep, but actually, the ones that endear themselves to you are the ones that handle\nit in the right way, the correct way. It doesn't mean that\nyou've got to like it. I didn't like it. And I thought that I handled\nit certainly in later years, in the right way. And I like to see athletes\ndo it in the right way, and I think that's it's a\nmake or break situation. It's not all the contests they win, it's the one that they lose and then how they pick themselves up and handle themselves after. So I think that that is a big one for me. And also, I mean, I went through, obviously,\na later divorce, and that was difficult on my son, really difficult on Ashley. And then I was, and I think that some of that was the fact that I was kind of, I wasn't drinking all the time, but I was drinking in\nexcess at the wrong times. And I think that that's what\na lot of people do sometimes is that they use it for the wrong reasons, you know, and I used to hear it. I hear it now all the time, and it's that I need to knock the edge off and I need to just forget, and I need to, you know, and you need to be in a\nfuzzy place for a while, and I had a lot of time in fuzzy place, and I needed to get rid of that, you know, and I needed to clear my head. - Where was that place? Some of the lower points in your life that you've reached mentally? - I think, definitely, the fact that my marriage, first marriage, didn't work, and that was, it's a mix\nof things between us. And then, you know, so that's not where I\nwanted to be at the time, and the effects that it had on my son. And it took a long time for him then to come round and to trust me again and to have belief. He always had belief in me, but to trust me again. And then I think that that was low. And I think that when I look back, is that a lot of my bad decisions were when I was in that\nfuzzy kind of haze. And then it got progressively worse. That got progressively worse\nto the degree where it was, you know, trying to hide it, and trying to hide how much. And I was kind of a\nfunctioning kind of drunk. I think you could probably say that. And I was functioning. I was still able to, I was still training most\ndays, crazily enough. I was training to kind\nof mask it and cover it. And that was probably my savior, that I was still, you know, because I remember I said to my wife, I said to Niki, \"I'm probably the fittest. If I'm a drunk, then I'm a fittest drunk in the world.\" She said, \"Yeah, you\nprobably are actually.\" I was in great condition for a drunk. - So the fuzzy haze, where was your mind? Did you have periods of depression? - I had periods of depression. I can honestly say that my\ndepression wasn't that bad. Although I did, you know, when it's like anything\nthat gives you an up, it gives you an even\nbigger down, doesn't it? And so I hated that feeling and also hated myself\nfor letting it happen, because I have got this really, it's a bizarre, I don't know whether\nyou can call it a power, but I have the ability to\nbe able to say, \"Stop.\" And I can just, and that's what I did in the end. In the end, there was an incident when I was working for Belgium Judo, and there was an incident. It was Christmas. I can tell you exactly the day. It was 20th of December, and me and a Belgian coach, we got absolutely hammered, but we were at the wrong\nplace and it got noticed. And so I remember they pulled\nme up in front of this board and I looked down at these guys and half of them were\npeople I didn't want to be in that situation with. You know, they're not\npeople that I respected and they're not people that I trusted. So I said, \"If you're going to sack me, sack me, but I'll promise you now\nthat I will just, this is it. I'll stop. I'm just going to stop. I've decided.\" On the way back in the car, I rang Niki up, my wife, and I said, \"Whatever\nyou hear now, whatever, I'm just going to stop.\" So that was it. Stopped. - You just saw the\nmoment and said, \"Stop.\" - Stop. - So that fuzzy place, what advice could you give to people about how to overcome that, that dark place, the depression, whether it has to do with drinking or not? - I think if it's to do with drinking, all I can say is that the two days or a week into not drinking, you'll feel different. It'll make a physical difference, and you'll like that physical difference, and then from a mental\nperspective as well, because I think that you\nhave a massive downer, and I think that that must\nbe because of drugs as well, because I had a situation with my brother. He was like, he was professional wrestling, and the drugs was an element there, and so I'd never touched a drug or even seen one in my life, but I'd let the alcohol side go too far, and then decided never to do that. So then I guess I had\npeople ringing me up saying, \"How can we stop?\" So when they say, \"Can I have a word, and can I discuss something with you?\" And I know then what they\nwant to discuss with me. And the thing is that I would say, \"If you stop, then feel the effects of it, and it will make a difference\nto your everyday life, and that will make a massive difference.\" And I think about anybody\nwho is down all the time is to find the cause of\nwhat's pushing you down, you know what I mean? And try and attack that, because it's never, somebody once said to me, they said, \"Whatever you got, we've got something special.\" I mean, we have a great life and I've had a great competition record. You know, it could have been\nbetter, but it was great. But I've had success with my business and we're still out there. And we have a great life. We travel all the world, and there's people out there\nthat would live in your house at the drop of a hat, wherever you are. They'd drive your car,\nno matter what car it is, some people haven't got a car. And whatever food you're having, and you're moaning about food, somebody out there that would\ntake that and gladly eat that. All right, so there's always\nsomebody worse off than you. And I think that we tend to sometimes look at the\nthings that we haven't got rather than the things we have got. - Yeah, it's a skill, probably, just to be grateful for\nthe things you have, exactly as you said. And it's sometimes the little things like food and cars and\nall that kind of stuff, just to have gratitude for it, and family, all this kind of stuff. But it's still, having talked to a bunch\nof Olympic athletes, there is a, when you give so much\nof your life to winning and then you lose, sometimes even when you win, but when you lose at the very top, it's a tough, tough, like, tough thing to go through. - The most difficult thing, I think, for anybody, is when they have to decide when to stop. - Yeah, yeah. - You know, and all of a sudden, and I see the ones that are\ngoing second Olympic Games and then third Olympic, and the ones that are there and they're holding on and they're in their thirties now, different to when they\nwere 19 years of age. 30-something is different to 19. And then what are you\ngoing to do afterwards? And then how do you become\njust a normal person? You're never going to be\na normal person, as such. But I think you've got\nto do normal things, and then you've got, I remember the first time that\nwhen I finished competition, I had good sponsors. This was 40 years ago, but I had two really good sponsorships, vitamin company and also judogi company, and I had a car, and I had money, and I was going all over the world. I was successful. And then I stopped, and they took everything back. They took my car, and they did it within two weeks as well. They stopped my funding. And the vitamin company said, \"Thank you very much. It's been a great. We've done well by you. Bye bye.\" - This was after your last Olympics. - '88 Olympics. When that finished, and then that was it, and then it's, right, okay. First time I had to go in there and buy a tracksuit and a pair of training shoes, and wow. - Yeah, those are different sitting there in the evening by yourself. - So you go from seven days\na week or six days a week, going into the gym, and you're working out the dojo, and then you don't have to do it. And that's why you get a lot of, when they finish competition, they finish, that 30 to 40. It's still, I mean, Ilias is still doing it now. He's still in there, and\nhe's still, you know. Because he can, right? Okay, and it's natural. And I did exactly the same. And then, like I say, you just get to an age, and you just think, \"Well, I'm just going to\nkind of take a step back.\" - Which is why there's certain athletes like Ryoko Tani, never stops. Just dominates for 14 years, probably one of the\nwinningest athletes in judo. - Yeah. - Seven-time World Champ,\ntwo-time Olympic Champ, medaled at five Olympics. So it's always impressive. - Never stopped. - Never stopped. So that's an option, if\nyou're like the greatest ever. - It'd be interesting, wouldn't it, just to see what they're\ndoing now, you know? Because at some stage you\nhave to get a normal job. - Right, you do have to stop. - You do have to stop. At some stage you have to\ndecide what you're gonna do, and it's either into coaching. The judo is either to coaching, or if you're not in coaching, then it's into something\nto do with the media. And I was lucky that I, it was just by accident,\nreally, with the commentary. Somebody said, \"Would you do a voiceover?\" So I did this voiceover. And that was back in 1982. I did that. - So you've been commentating since 1982? - I did some voiceovers. I wouldn't call it commentating, but I did some voiceovers, and then I did some, we did some different\nEuropean Championships, World Championship kind of events and I did the voiceovers for it. And the way that it was done, that it was more narration. And so it kind of turned into, then somebody asked me to do an event. And when you listened to\nthe intonation of the voice and stuff like that, it wasn't like it is now. But I guess that's just\nsomething that developed, because then it was coming from the heart, and I started to get excited\nand just do my thing. And it was just me, really. Just my style. - Well, I've listened to your\ncommentary from a while back. I don't know if it's the eighties, but it's still there. - I think it's timing as well, isn't it? It's like, you know, you get your timing a bit better and know when to go in, when to come out, when to say something, when not. And I think that in the early days, I tended to think, I tended to want to talk all the time, and you don't have to do that. - Also knowing when to shut up. - That's the key, isn't it? - Yeah, part of the\ndrama is in the silence, building up to the setup and the throw and all that kind of stuff. But also you're very good at, while radiating passion, being very precise and specific about the details of\nthe throw and the setup and why something worked and didn't. - Yeah, I think there's\ntwo kinds of commentating. You can commentate what you see and then you commentate\nwhat people can't see. And so if you've got somebody that is not really understanding\nof what's happening in the inner part of the game, so it might be a technical thing or it might be the tactical part of the play here that's going on, and if you can introduce that as well, then you've got an advantage. - Quick pause. I need a bathroom break. (laughs) - Okay, good stuff. - So we just took a little\nbreak and went to JudoTV.com, which is, I guess, an IGF website. And IGF is the organization behind a lot of the big\njudo events of the world. And I just signed up. You should sign up, too. It's great. - Absolutely, sign up. Cheaper the price.\n(Lex laughing) Cheaper the price. - Yeah. And you can watch basically\nany match from the grand slams and going back through history, I guess. - Yeah, I've got to say,\nLex, I mean, everybody, still people are saying\nto me, \"Oh, you know, we need more judo on television.\" They've got judo on\ntelevision every other week that they can access all of the top people in all the top events, and it costs $100 a year. You know, it's to access everything. And they can play all the videos. I mean, we've just accessed this here, the Paris tournament, and we're going to have\na look at Teddy Riner. But it's so, it's cheap at the price. - So we're now in Paris Grand Slam 2024, Teddy Riner final. By the way, super cool. Like, you click on the draw and you can just look\nat any of the matches. You can go to the bottom of the finals. You can go. - [Neil] Yeah, to anyone. - Any one of them. That's so cool. It was really well done, really well done interface."

      "section": "Teddy Riner",
      "text": "Anyway, let me at first ask\nthe ridiculous big question. Who do you think is the\ngreatest of all time? Is Teddy Riner in the running? - He's the greatest\njudo winner of all time, of that there's no doubt, you know. I mean, he is the, and I think if you asked him whether he was the greatest judo man in the world of all time, he would say, \"No, I'm not.\" And he's not the greatest judo man. There are people with more\nbeautiful judo in some ways. Although he's got great technique. But he is the ultimate winner. - [Lex] Ten-time World Champ. - [Neil] Yeah. - Two-time gold medalist in the Olympics. I guess two-time bronze medalist. He's probably going, is he going to Paris? - Yeah. - He's going after it again. So he's right here. - He's right there. This is just a couple of months ago. And then last week, this last week, he was out again, and he won again. - Do you think he gets\ngold medal this time? - There's people getting\ncloser to him, right? Because he's obviously, age-wise, and the amount of time\nthat he's been there. He's obviously somebody that is starting not quite at his best as he was when he was younger. But, like I say, he still\nputs it on the line. He lays it on the line every single time. And then not only does\nhe lay it on the line, but he beats them all. And last week, he just beat Saito, who was a young, up-and-coming\nJapanese fighter. And he beat him in the final. It was close, and he did well. There are certain people. The smaller ones, actually,\nnot the taller ones. Because we're saying about the big arm over\nthe top that he likes. And the dominant grip that he likes. There are people that\ncan give him a hard time. Now, if at the Olympic Games, he has two or three of those on the trot, it might work against him. And it's by no means an absolute certainty that he's going to win\nthe Olympic gold medal. But he's got to be one of\nthe favorites, top favorite. No matter what happens now, Teddy Riner is the greatest winner. And if you asked the great Yamashita, he would say the same. You know, there's nobody that's, and Yamashita was unbeaten\nin international competition. And I trained with Yamashita\na lot over a two-year period and got to know him quite well. And he was one of the\ngreatest of all times. For me, he was one of\nthe greatest judo men, and I'm talking about from\na technical point of view, from a spectacular judo point of view, understanding the fundamental principles of how techniques work, sometimes having different\ntechniques that work for you. So if one doesn't work and one particular direction doesn't work, you can change the direction completely. - In case people don't know, Yamashita is this legendary\njudoka heavyweight. Teddy Riner, heavyweight,\nthat's plus 100 kg. - He would have caused\nhim all sorts of problems. - Oh, yeah, that's cool. Who do you think wins,\nYamashita versus Riner? - Yes, I think Yamashita. - Wait, whoa whoa whoa! You think Yamashita beats Teddy Riner? - I think so. - Strong words. You think so? You think so? Yamashita is on the shorter side, right? - Yeah. And he finds it more difficult with shorter people, you know? And so it was, it would have been a very\ninteresting confrontation. And I think if you asked Yamashita, he would probably say, that Teddy Riner, he's very gracious. He's really gracious. It would be really good. It would have been an\nunbelievable matchup. And I've got to say this, that Teddy Riner is the\ngreatest winner of all time. - Competition-wise. So it's interesting, both of them, maybe you can correct me, but have this osotogari, which is a kind of trip\nthat I never understood. - [Neil] Yeah. - It's a very tricky thing to do, right? It's very easy to do\nmaybe as a white belt, you roll in, you can understand, but like to do it at the\nhigh, high, high-level. - You see any of the top guys now, especially if they're second time out, so like they might catch\nsomebody by surprise. They come out and they go bang. Oh, and you go, that was amazing. But if they fought again, ten minutes later, you go, you're not going to catch\nme with that, right? You've got a different situation here. And so it's slightly different. But the best fighters adapt, (Neil snaps his fingers)\nlike that, and they're able to see a situation, feel the situation, and they attack once, and then go again and\nattack second, third time, and in the third time they make it work. - Yeah, both Yamashita and Teddy Riner, with the osotogari, they'll just like hit it\nover and over in the match. - Yeah, sometimes they'll hit\nfirst time and it won't go. And then you make a\nreadjustment of the way in. It's a little bit like, I mean, a really easy way of understanding it is if we're shooting at a target, and all of a sudden you\nstart moving that target, you know, it's different\nhitting a moving target, but it's also different\nhitting a moving target that's trying to hit you as well. And that's our game. So we're not only trying\nto throw a moving target, we're trying to throw a moving target that's trying to throw us. So it makes it even more difficult. - Yeah, there's a few folks who, you know what's coming. It's like, over and over and over, it's the same attack\nanyway with this uchi mata. It's like. It's different. It's different. There's not many people like that where it's like this, the same attack. I mean, there's other attacks also, but they'll just go after the same thing over and over and over. - When I watch great athletes, most of them can throw over both flanks, not always going left and right, although our sport always, I mean, the catters are always\ndemonstrated left and right. So, if you demonstrate, if you do something on one side, then can you demonstrate\nit on the other side? Okay, so can you do it equally? No, but you do it differently\non the other side. So, you know, when I'm teaching, I don't teach left and right. So if I was teaching\nyou to do a technique, first thing I do is say, \"I need you to take sleeve and lapel.\" All right. So I'd let you decide\nwhat was left and right. Because often what happens\nis we impart on people whether they're going to be left or right when we start teaching, you get a lot of teachers do that, and they'll say immediately, \"What do you write with, left or right hand?\" And it's no indicator, actually, as to how we do judo,\nbecause I'm left-handed and I do more predominantly right-handed, because I lead off my strongest hand. And actually, most people do. So actually, left and right\nis a bit of a trap sometimes when we're teaching. Better to get, because we can go, so my point was that a lot\nof people can go both flanks, so they'll do something over this side and something over this side. - But anyway, was one side? - He was one-sided,\nbut he could switch it. So he had a seoi nage as\nwell on the other side. So he could switch it if he had to. - Oh, interesting. And by the way, your opponent in '84, was he righty or lefty? - He was a righty. - So that drop left seoi, where did that come from? - Well, I mean, again, he could have, probably in other contests, he'd hit me with it several\ntimes and I've just stopped it, and just at the wrong place\nat the right time for him. Right place and the\nwrong time for me, right? - That's life, you know? - Yeah. - All right, let's watch some Teddy Riner. (crowd cheering) - This is final of a Paris tournament, and this is against the Korean. The Korean had had a great day, actually. - [Lex] Again, shorter. - Again, shorter. So he does find that difficult. Have a look at Teddy Riner. Teddy Riner will try and catch the sleeve. He's after the sleeve, and then the right arm over the top. That's the key point for Teddy Riner. And, of course, what he has done, if he can't always catch the big osotogari over his right-hand side, he's been doing something\nto the opposite side. - [Lex] And the Korean\njust went for a drop seoi. And Teddy Riner blocked with the hips. He's, (laughs) he's a big boy. - Like I say, he has difficulty always\nagainst somebody smaller, dropping with the seoi nages. - [Lex] Has Teddy Riner\never been thrown for ippon? Do you remember? - I've never seen him thrown for ippon, but he was thrown last\nweek for a nice technique and he's being caught more and more. - So he's getting close. - Yeah. And to say of in the final\nof the World Championships, they had a strange situation there where Tasoev was a technique down and then pulled off a counter and they didn't count it, but then they overruled it. Unfortunately, I was\ncommentating at the time, and I went for a score for Tasoev, and anyway, they overruled it, and then they awarded a\nsecond gold medal to Tasoev. - [Lex] What can you say\nabout Tamerlan Bashaev, who also gave him trouble? - Yeah, Bashaev and Tasoev are the two that could possibly go to the Olympics. So that was a close one there from Riner. That was closest that\nhe'd actually been there. - [Lex] Oh, wow. - So didn't have the sleeve, and he relies on the sleeve greatly. Big support there from\nthe French in the crowd. - And also maybe, can you explain the\npenalties for stalling? - Yeah, so if they don't attack, if they've got a grip, and they've got sleeve lapel\nor they got two hands on, if they're too passive\nand they don't attack, if they've got dominant sleeve\ngrip, they don't attack. That was quite close as\nwell from the Korean. So the Korean here, you can\nsee, is having a real go. The penalties will come\nif they don't attack at the right time. Step outside the yellow area,\nthey'll get penalized as well. - [Lex] (chuckles) That's dedication for, - Absolutely. I mean, it was really close, wasn't it? Nice little kouchi gari\nthere from the Korean. And if they touch below the beltline with the arms, so they're not allowed to grab the legs. They've stopped grabbing the legs. - [Lex] Wow, the Korean is really going. - The Korean is having\na real good go at it. - I guess every single person in that division is probably training for Teddy Riner, right? - You think, Teddy Riner\nhas been there a long time, and he's got another guy here in the final of the Paris tournament. He's got 18,000 people watching him. They're all on Teddy Riner's side. They want him to win. And the Koreans out there\non his own with his coach. - But also the pressure on Teddy Riner. - Amazing pressure. We interviewed him\nafter this, and he said, I've got pressure. People go, \"Is he going to\ndo it at the Olympic Games?\" Can I do it in Paris? He wanted to go to Paris. I mean, really, the last Olympic Games\nshould have been it. Shouldn't it be your last? Should have been the final one. But he's gone, \"No, I've got to do another four years.\" Two penalties are on the\nboard already for the Korean. That Korean is really having\na great go at Teddy Riner. - He's got a little bit of a lift on him. He's going after it. (laughs) - He's really going after it. You know, it's an amazing\neffort there from the Korean, and he's getting some\nlast minute information. I don't know if you've ever seen his coach stood next to him like\nthat, but it's amazing. He's six-foot six, and\nhe's about four-foot six. (Lex laughing) - He's a real pitch. - Full of passion, I love it. He's like screaming. - So golden score. - How does golden score work? - So the golden score. So if it goes without any\npoint on the board from a throw or a hold down or armlock strangle, then it goes into golden score. So two shidos on the board apiece. One more mistake now, and\nit's going to be all over. - And that's it. - Teddy Riner just manages\nto turn it on the Korean. And that went really against\nthe runner play, didn't it? Because the Korean did better. But Teddy Riner is a winner, and he says, \"Right, okay, let's have more cheering.\" - Finds a way to score. - And I have to say\nthat even when he loses, he's always graceful. He doesn't like it, but he's graceful. - Yeah, there is so much\nlove there in celebration. It was great, it's great to see. It's great that he's doing\nit again, going after it, chasing the gold medal again. - Well, he's chasing the gold medal. It's going to be in Paris, which is going to be even more fantastic. He's already the greatest. You said, \"What has he got\nto do to be the greatest?\" He's already the greatest\ncompetitor judo has ever known. And that was even, you know, with the great Tani. So, Tani was amazing as well. - Are you part of the commentating team? - I'm part of the commentating team, but it won't be for IJF, because it's independent broadcast. - Have you ever had an\nathlete sort of come up to you and ask, \"Why'd you say that?\" Or disagree with your commentary? - Do you know, I've got to say that 99%, 99.9% of everybody is so grateful that I've commentated their\nfights all the way through. They know if they've messed up. So if I say something,\nand I'm never disparaging, really disparaging,\nbut what I will say is, \"It was a great throw by the other guy,\" or, \"It was a great match,\" and if they made a mistake, so if they walk out, they know that I will say something that will mean something. So nobody really moans about it. I try and talk the truth if I can. - So who else would you\nconsider as some of the greats? So I personally, just because I love the\nstanding seoi-nage, Koga. So there's like, you know, the number of times you\nwon the World Championships and the Olympic Games, but there's also how you won, and how you went into fights, and what you did. It's not necessarily\nabout getting gold medals. It's about how you fought and how you represent the sport. And there's certain athletes\nlike Inoue and Iliadis that are going after the big throws. - Only after they just want\nto win by ippon, you know, and I think that is the difference is they're the ones that come out there and it's a bit like when\nTyson stepped out there, you knew what you were going to get. And if they went toe to toe, if Tyson had somebody going toe to toe, somebody was going to get knocked out. And we got the same in judo. When people go head to head\nand it's an open match, and I often talk about an open match, I say it's an open match. They're both trying to score. Somebody is going to get scored on. Somebody's going to go. And that makes it exciting. - That's great. - When they come out and they close up, then that's not an exciting match. - Is there a case for Ono? Shohei Ono, three-time World Champ, two-time gold medalist. - I think that, judo-wise, he's got to be one of the greatest because he had such versatility. He could go right and he could go left. He could pick up. He could go to the ground as well. He won a lot of his earlier\nmatches on the ground. I think his empathy and how he presents himself, sometimes he falls down. And I think that hopefully\nthat should come with tutoring and how to be a great champion after. You know, it's not just\nabout what you do on the mat, but what you do off the mat as well. - So to you, a great\nchampion is the whole package of how you present yourself when you lose, how you represent yourself,\njust even off the mat. - Yeah, I think it's how you\npresent yourself afterwards, how you are with people, how much you can help people. I mean, people, kids, and they look up to these great champions because they want to be like them. So the worst thing is\nwhen you get somebody that's a bit of an ass and they're not presenting themselves in the right way. So I like to see somebody\npresenting themselves in the right way, and I think that it's\nsomething that can be taught. It's something that normally comes with a little bit of experience, a little bit of age, you know? And I like to think that I'm\na little bit different now than I was when I was 19. Not that I was bad, I\njust think I was just, you know, I see it often now, just full of beans. (laughs) - You're a beautiful work in progress. What about Nomura? Tadahiro Nomura, that's\nthree-time gold medalist. - [Neil] Never lost an Olympic fight. - [Lex] There's something there. - Yeah, nobody ever done that. You know what I mean? So that's got to be. There has to stand. He took two years off in\nbetween every Olympic Games and came back, did the right amount of events to qualify for, not only did he having to qualify, he had to qualify through Japan. Now, Japan, remember, have\ngot the greatest depth, so they got people coming\nthrough all the time. And then he had to win\nthe Japanese Trials. I mean, we had a four-time\nWorld Champion from Japan. This is when World Championships\nwas every other year. And this is Shozo Fujii. And he was the greatest\nmiddleweight of all time, and never got to\nparticipate in the Olympics because he lost the Japanese Trials twice in two Olympic possibilities. So he had to qualify for Japan and then go to the Olympic\nGames and then do it there. So sometimes some of the best people in Japan can't get outside of Japan. Look at the situation they had with Abe and then they had Maruyama. Maruyama and Abe were\nboth the best, by far, in the under 66 kilos category. This is for the last Olympic Games. And they sent one to\nthe World Championships, one to the Olympic Games, and they both won gold medals, you know? - Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's why the\nAll-Japan Championships are legendary. There's these battles with\nYamashita and all of them. - Well, Abe and Maruyama, they had a Trials in the Kodokan. It was 26 minutes. I think it was 26 minutes it went. They were battling it out for 26 minutes. - That's great. If we can just go to,"

      "section": "Training in Japan",
      "text": "you've trained in Japan. What are those randoris like? What's that training like? - I touched on the danger, that danger of being thrown, when you get hold of somebody or somebody gets hold of you. And I often reflect, I often talk about it\nwhen I'm commentating, because I can see immediately. It's easy, isn't it? We're in the commentary chair, or if you're in the coach's chair and you don't really understand totally, absolutely what's going on when\nsomebody's being out-gripped and when they're in\ndanger of being thrown. I mean, if you're in\ndanger of being thrown, the first thing you do is stick your backside out and defend by not being in the position\nthey want you to be in. All right? And so that's danger. You feel the danger. And so in Japan, that was the place I used to go to train because I felt the danger. And so my defenses would be heightened. And so somebody that was, I went two years, one Olympic cycle, I went two years, two months without having a score on me in any competition. And then I went to one competition in the European\nChampionships, which I won, and I was struggling\nall the way through it and got scored on three times in my pool, my first pool of fights. And I was devastated, and actually nearly lost\nthe whole competition because I was more mortified about being scored on three times when I hadn't been scored\non for two and a half years. I had this thing in my head\nabout two and a half years, and then all of a sudden,\nI'm not unbeatable. And then you just, and you go. And I almost lost it, completely lost it. Just so fortunate. A couple of things went\nmy way, and just came out, and I scraped and scratched\nmy way to the final and won the final well. All right, but that was my best match, but I almost lost it. - Well, what do you do with the fact if you go to Japan and you're getting, you're saying danger, like you're probably getting, - Getting thrown. - Getting thrown in Japan. What's that do to your ego? - Well, again, it's my, that was a winning ego that had to adapt. I remember we went to the kasejo, which, police dojo, one time, and they wanted to see the, they created this groundwork competition because they wanted to see me do the juji. How I went in and how I.\n- [Lex] Armbar. - Yeah, the armbar. They wanted to see how I did it from underneath or over the top. So they created this event. - Study the creature. - Yeah, they started it, so. And then winner stays on. Competition was happening at the kasejo. So I did about seven, I think, seven in, and then my coach came in and said, \"No, it's finished. That's it now, it's finished.\" You know, suddenly we\nrealized what was going on, and I was going, \"No, no, no, don't stop it.\" (Lex laughing) Like that, you know. And it was one of those moments where the boot was on\nmy foot, you could say, rather than the other side, the other way, because I had been to Japan in situations. I remember as a 16-year-old, I got such a drumming from one of the Japanese guys, older students, and he had a gold tooth, and so he was Goldtooth to me, and he was my nightmare. And I remember I kept\ncoming out to fight him because he kept throwing me, and I was crying and I was upset, and I was like, and then that was another occasion where I got dragged\naway, and I said, \"No.\" So I wanted to go back and fight him. And I went back to the same\ndojo every year to fight him. He was on my mind. Morning, noon, night, he was on my mind. - [Lex] Goldtooth was on your mind. - Goldtooth was on my mind, you know? - Did you ever get him? - Two years later, I was. Two years to me, from 16 to\n18 was totally different. 18 years of age, I was pretty competitive with him, and it was like I was\nstanding up with him. 19, he was in the groundwork competition. - Mm-hmm. And that's when the switch happened. - Switch happened, you\nknow, because I just, well, because I remember\ngetting the armlock, and didn't put it on immediately. I needed it to last. It had to last. - Sure. - So I spread, the whole thing lasted as long\nas I could possibly get it. And it was a long memory as I was looking down at him. - And now he has nightmares about you. I wonder what nickname he has for you. - I don't know. I'm hoping that he remembers me. He has a photo of you. He probably doesn't say, he doesn't back an eyelid. Doesn't say a thing about it. - Well, I mean, can you just speak to that\ntraining with those folks, you know, you said crying, just the frustration of being thrown. - [Neil] Yeah. - I mean, what, how do you? It's such a beautiful part of\nthe process of becoming great. - Yeah, I think it is just something that doesn't happen at this level. You know, we were talking about levels, and then at this level, it never happened. And then I went out in\nmy first European Cadet, and all of a sudden I wasn't the top guy. I was in the mix, and then I had to work myself\nto the top of that mix, and then to the top of the next one, because I went to the\nEuropean Senior Championships, and again, you're not the top. And you work your way to the top of that. And I think it is a frustration, but I think it's that\nkind of hatred of losing and also, being out of control. I think that the first time, first Senior European\nChampionships I fought, I had fought Nevzorov, but he\nwas only one in my contest. Then I had to fight a\nFrenchman for third place, but he totally outgripped me. And I remember I was more upset, though I won the contest, I was more upset that he totally, he did outgrip me, and I was more upset. And then I fought him a year later, and I outgripped him. All right, so it was one of those, it was a learning process\nall the way through. - Yeah, that frustration is like, whatever that does to your soul, the building up afterwards is what actually makes you better. It's fascinating. And you think there's, in Japan, just killers there that are\nthe world doesn't know about? - Yeah, there's World\nChampions in the dojo. There's people that never make it out. I remember we were training like so, and everybody that goes to Japan, all my friends that have\nbeen World Olympic Champions, they all know what I'm talking about. They know exactly who I'm what I'm saying is that when\nwe go to the dojos there, we all get thrown by people that never come\nout to be World Champions. They're just in the mix while they're going through\nthree years of university. And then they go, we had a guy, (Lex laughing) we had a guy that came in, he was business guy, came in with his suitcase\nin his briefcase like that. He's got his tie up like that. So he decides he's going to come in, and he gets changed, and he's in his lunch hour. He's in his lunch hour, right? So got to be quick. (Lex laughing) So he comes in and he goes through, he's working his way through\nthe whole of the British team. We're all lined up, right? So he's just working his\nway through the whole of the British team. And I knew it was my turn next. - On his lunch hour. - So I get hold of him, and\nI throw him immediately. And then it was what we were talking about when it happens in the first\nfew seconds of the practice. So then I had four minutes\nof him coming at me, and I'm going up into the air, and I'm twisting off, and I'm like. And then everybody's laughing\nat the side of the mat, or the whole British team. He's gone through the whole British team. And then he, ten minutes later, he's tied his tie up like that, you know, and oh, back to work, like that. Imagine him sitting behind\nhis desk and his computer. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I'm glad he didn't get out. (Lex and Neil laughing) - Hopefully, he listens to this. - Hopefully. - Anybody else I didn't mention as part of the greats that\njust kind of jump to your mind? - Kashiwazaki Sensei is my\nfavorite of all favorites. He is what I would call a judo genius. I don't know if you can get him up here. Can we get him up? - Yeah. - So go into 1981 World Championships, and I'll talk you through\nthe great Kashiwazaki. He was one year in Great Britain, and he was a guy that\nwas so much a genius. All right, so you want the\nfinal of the under 65 kg there, the one at the top. This is him. He is two weight categories\nbelow my weight category that I won the World\nChampionships, same year I won it. So this is, it's not, I'm not sure if this is\ngoing to show his final. - [Lex] This is a highlight. - Oh, watch this. This he did in the final.\n- What! - In the final of the World.\n- For people just listening, he did an incredible sacrifice throw. - Yep, and then he was\non top for the newaza and renowned for his groundwork, and he was on top of against\na really strong Romanian guy. All right, so his transition\nwas just phenomenal. - Yeah, let me go back and look at that, what just happened. - So he's just showing you. So he does this koji thing\njust to create space. - Oh, wow. - And it's his follow\nthrough into groundwork that is best of all. And then the Romanian, really strong, like I say, he'd gone all the way through to the final of the World Championships, winning most by ippon,\nI think, the Romanian, and he's defending\nreally, really well here. And you can see that,\nhow persistent he is. He knows exactly what he wants. He's just got to get his leg out. Now watch, he'll tie the arm up, and then he'll pull the\ntop leg towards him, and then he'll push the bottom one off. - Always working. - With both feet. Always working, always working. Readjust the balance. Still one leg trapped. Final of the World Championships. Good referee, because he's\nrefereeing something here that's happening that's going\nto decide as to whether, so he doesn't call it\nto stand it up at all. Watch him pull the top one now, and he will push the bottom one. - There's a calmness on his face. It's great to see. - Calm, calm. Pushes the bottom leg out. Job done. All finished. This is him again. Watch this. This is another technique that he does. - [Lex] The sacrifice. - And then just again,\nsacrifice directly in, directly into the newaza. - Transition is everything, isn't it? In judo. - Yeah, well, in anything, really, but judo it especially pays off. - Yeah. I mean, because we haven't got that long. I mean, we had more time here. They've just brought more time back. So we've got more time to transition in and to get the situation that we want and to get the attacking\nsituation that we want, because I remember I\nwas teaching in America to some jiu-jitsu guys, and they were saying, \"Oh, we'll never give you our back.\" And I said, with judo rules, certain situations, it happens that when we try and do throws where we're facing away from our opponent, so for example seoi nages, if they fail, then the back is there, and that's how we get the back. And it's a different situation than going on your back\nin the guard situation, totally different. - Well, there Travis Stevens, I don't know how familiar with his judo, but he's a really interesting example because he competed at the highest level in jiu-jitsu as well. And his idea, he's a big seoi-nage guy, and he basically threw all of that away. - [Neil] In the jiu-jitsu? - In the jiu-jitsu. Like, he took the sport\nfrom scratch for what it is. So he almost never did\na standing seoi nage or seoi nages at all in in jiu-jitsu. - No, because it would\nleave his back all the time, if it failed, you know what I mean? But he wouldn't have the same\nkind of grip on the judogi or the the jiu-jitsu gi. A little bit different. - And so you have to kind\nof consider the sport, the art of it, and also the competitors, the styles, and the culture of the sport if you want to win. If winning is the most important thing, then like, all right, well, let's. - But you learn the game, don't you? And that's what he did. He learned the game, and I think that is credit to him, and that's why I say about wrestling. The wrestlers, I mean, good to learn the judo and for what it is and the mechanics and how it works, and then learn the wrestling. I mean, I do the commentary\nas well for the freestyle, and I will be at the\nOlympics for the freestyle and the Greco-Roman, so. And I love the freestyle. Absolutely love it. But freestyle is freestyle. Judo is judo. I like to see people doing judo. - Yeah. But there's a rhyme to\nthe whole combat thing. They're all, I mean, the body mechanics, it's all like fascinating\nechoes of each other in interesting ways. The details are different, but they're still two humans clashing. - Yeah, we've got some\namazing crossovers with people like the Mongolians have\ncome in, the Georgians. I mean, the Georgians do massive pickups and different techniques. And, you know, if you ask the fighters whether grabbing the legs, a lot of them would say some\nof the wrestling styles, the Georgians and the\nMongolians might say, \"Yeah, I'd like to be\nable to take the legs,\" but a lot of them just adapted. You get Iliadis for\nexample, he just adapted. So he thought, \"Well, I'll\ntake my arm over the top and I'll just rip him\nout the floor that way.\" You know what I mean? - They're still doing the big lifts, they're still doing the big gripping, but they just don't grab below the legs. - [Neil] Yeah. - It's weird. They figured it out. (laughs) - And they figured it out like that. - Yeah, you would think\nit'd take a long time. No, it was like a month. (laughs) - Yeah, no, exactly. - The highest level, which is crazy."

      "text": "So you mentioned jiu-jitsu a little bit. What to you is an interesting difference between jiu-jitsu and\njudo that you've observed? Because you're one of the greatest ever on the ground in judo. And so jiu-jitsu is primarily focused on similar type of stuff on the ground. So what to you is an\ninteresting difference there? - They're a different approach, different time scale to them, and they have a different way in. So, like where ours comes from a standing position directly in, we've got a time scale on it. So we have to, like the catch. I always talk about the catch, because in judo terms, if you don't get the catch immediately, then the referee won't\nsee the transition in and also the continuation\nfrom plan A, B, C, D, if something builds. So we have to build it, and we have to build it quickly. And I think in jiu-jitsu terms, you have more time to build. - Yeah, there's a, there's\na kind of patience, like, oh, if this doesn't work out, I could try a different thing. Just with judo, there's like an urgency. - [Neil] There's an urgency. - And there's a ref watching skeptically. So you better show that\nyou're making progress. - You've got to show the progression. And that's why, you know, I\nalways had a plan A, B, C. You see there with, that was 1981 there. The Great Kashiwazaki had a progression. You know, everything was, he knew exactly where he had to be. It was feel. That wasn't by accident. It was trained. And I think that that transition there and taking control of somebody's mistake, so somebody might have made a mistake or not hit properly or your defense has caused\nthem to make a mistake, and then you take advantage of it, and that is the difference. - So one of the side effects of that, I don't know with the chicken or the egg, but judo people on the ground\nare much more aggressive. So probably because of the urgency, but just like there's an intention behind the progress you're making. I think jiu-jitsu is more relaxed. There's more a culture of\njust finding places to relax and think of different control and positions and take your time. And as a result, it's\nmuch, much less exhausting. So you can go for much longer. It feels like judo is exhausting. - It's that ten second blast, isn't it? It's like doing sprints all the time, and that is really hard and that's a special kind\nof condition you need, and you need to be able to catch it and know when to go and when not to go. And I think also, I was going to ask you, you think it'd make a difference? I mean, certain jiu-jitsu, you can't just throw yourself\non your back into the guard. You have to throw into the situation. So you have got, I mean, I know Roger Gracie, he decided that he was\ngoing to learn judo. He saw the importance\nof being able to throw for the transition in, and so he came to the Budokwai, and he was learning off Ray Stevens, and they were doing really a lot. - Yeah, well, he's a fascinating study because he does the most basic stuff. - But does it well. - Like, what another level of well. It's like Yamashita. Everyone knows what's\ncoming with Roger Gracie, but he just does it anyway against the best people in the world. It's crazy. He's like, everybody in jiu-jitsu at white belt learns the\ntechniques he's using, and he just does it. - Amazing, isn't it? But he has about a thousand ways in. - Yeah, yeah. I mean, and in the thousand ways, there's in the details, so it kind of might even\nlook the same to people, but there's, I mean he\nfinds a way to choke people, so he's on top of them, mounted in a sort of judo pin position. And everyone knows what's coming next against the best people in the world, and you should be able to\ndefend it, but nobody can. It's crazy. - I think there's the\npower element as well. You know, that you don't realize how, when somebody's directed\nin a particular way, then you have that kind of\nelement of absolute power. You can only feel, like when Roger's doing a technique, I think that you would only\nfeel it if he did it on you. You know, then then you can feel it. It's not something that happens, so tricks is one thing, but actually being able to\ndo something really well from a power point of view, it's like you say, he only does those few things, but he does them really,\nreally, really well. - Yeah, I don't know what\nthat is about, actually, judo pins is a very\ninteresting case study as well, because people are able to feel so heavy. One of the things judoka are able to do is pin extremely well, and it makes you realize that\nit's not about the weight. It's about some kind of technique that makes people feel like\nthey weigh 1,000 pounds. - It's about weight distribution\nand change of balance. A lot of people don't realize\nthat there's huge changes of balance on the ground, massive. You know what it's like. I mean, you're a jiu-jitsu man, and the detail of the techniques is what really interests me. I mean, I'm always looking\nsmall ideas, you know, I'm always looking at the jiu-jitsu, and it fascinates me. I would have done jiu-jitsu for sure, but I wouldn't have\nforgotten the judo way in to the techniques, you know what I mean? I think that you've got\nto differentiate the two, but I would have loved the jiu-jitsu. I would have absolutely loved it, but it wasn't as prominent then. Where the newaza came from, it came from a mistake, me getting beaten in a particular contest. And I went, I'm not going to\nbe beaten again on the ground. (Lex laughing) That's how it happened. - Yeah, well, yeah, the story of your life is like a loss creates the\nphoenix rises from the ashes. - Well, it was 1978, and it wasn't a mistake. It was a particular movement, and I was fighting weight\nup from my normal weight. But I stayed in the same position for one second too long, got caught and, - Choked. - Sankaku, yeah, triangle, triangle. - Triangle, wow. - And I said, I literally just the same as\nI said to you when I said, \"I'm not going to drink anymore.\" I came off and I said, \"I'm never going to get\ncaught on the ground again.\" - [Lex] Yeah, never going\nto lose on the ground. - And I never lost in my whole\ncompetitive career again. - Wow. But yeah, I should mention that\nthere is nothing like a pin from a judo person. And I don't actually know if people in jiu-jitsu\nhave made sense of that, like loaded that in. - But it's not part of, it's not part of the game, is it? You know, the pin, it's submission. - Yeah, but, you know, control is part of the game. - [Neil] Right. - And nobody controls a human body the way judo people do on the ground. Like they have understood\nthe science of control. And I think that control\nis extremely useful in jiu-jitsu as well. It's just that people don't, because there's so many\nother domains of exploration. - [Neil] It's interesting. - I mean, just, and especially when you apply jiu-jitsu to the fighting setting. So mixed martial arts, that control, that side control, that pin control is really,\nreally really important. But then you add punching to\nthe thing, and it becomes. - Yeah, puts a whole different\nthing on it, doesn't it? - I mean, there's an alternate history where you would have been\npart of the early UFCs if time was a little different. Maybe a few years later, because your style of judo and jiu-jitsu and the transitions and the aggression, all of that would have worked\nreally well in the early UFCs. - I'm sure I was being set up at one stage by one of the Gracies, and that was when he was\nwinning all the matches. But he came with a couple of the cousins to one of my seminars. - Nice. (laughs) - He was one of the first ones, wasn't he? That's how I love to see the kind of UFC, because it was different\nmartial arts, different skills, and I mean he'd get close, and he'd just choke them out or armlock them or armbar them. And that was brilliant. For me, that was a revelation. That was how I saw it. - It's a fascinating science experiment. Which aspects of different\nmartial arts work well and not when they clashed together? And it did turn out\nthat newaza worked well. - It was the key, wasn't it? - Yeah, it was a big missing link in our conception of fighting. It's the neutralizer of size. - Yeah. - And a lot of other components, and it just blew people's mind. Like, okay, it's not just about size. It's not just about big\nguys swinging hands. It's a lot of other components. And the groundwork is\nreally, really important. And, of course, there's a few judoka that\nsucceeded in the UFC since then, which is always\ninteresting, how they adapt. When you take off the gi, how can you still throw people? How can you still do control? How can you still take advantage of the transition on the ground? Ronda Rousey is a good example of somebody that took advantage of that. - Yeah, I think one of the biggest things for the judoka is we've never, you know, there's no strikes. And I think that's the biggest shock, if you wish, when you get. - Punched in the face. - When you get punched in the face and you're not used to that. That's not what we're used to. - Some people are able to get punched in the face better than others. Yeah, for sure. Then again, there's Ronda Rousey, who doesn't need to get\npunched in the face. She just gets in close, throws a person, armbar right there. - And Kayla, you know, Kayla as well. - Kayla Harrison, that's\nanother incredible person. She could have probably been\njust winning Olympic gold medal after Olympic gold medal, but chose to. - Whatever she decides. I mean, Ronda as well, you know, whatever they decided to do, they're great athletes. They hate losing. (Lex laughing) I don't know anybody that hates\nlosing more than those two. They don't like it. - And Kayla Harrison, I don't know anybody that\nworks as hard as her. That's a crazy, crazy, crazy work ethic."

      "section": "Training",
      "text": "Well, let me ask you about training. Again, Jimmy Pedro said\nhe learned a lot from you. He learned how to do a tai otoshi, and the armbar juji gatame. But he also learned from\nyou training methodology. So, what's he talking about? He told me about this. What's your approach to training throughout your career\nand as it developed? - I always wanted to train\nharder than anybody else. I still train now every day. If I don't train, do something, I do do an hour of my physical work, and I still go on the mat a little bit. I'm 65 now, so I'm not doing\nreally heavy stuff on the mat, but I still like to train. And when I was 21, 20, up to 30, I was one of the best trainers. But Jimmy Pedro was one of\nthe best trainers as well. He was one of the, he's one of your dream athletes. When Jimmy Pedro stepped\nthrough your door, and he was just a kid. He was just young when he\nstepped through my door. And I had a lot of full-time trainers, so I had up to 20 really good athletes that were training hard, and I only wanted hard trainers. Give me ten that trained hard rather than your one prima donna, that you're skillful, the one that could do it. I just, I wanted 10 or\n20 really hard trainers because you can do so much with them. You can make champions. You can make them World Champions. You know, if you got somebody\nthat was a special talent and they wanted to work hard, then you had a special athlete. - Well, when you say hard\ntrainers, what do you mean? Are these people that just, like, every single day are able\nto just grind it out? Do randori, do the training,\ndo the boring things, just keep coming back? - Yeah, when they're going gets tough. And I think that that was him. He had a special mentality, and the thing is, you see, when you've got him in\nyour dojo, all right, even when you're tired, when somebody's tired, what an example to the others, so he'd pull the other\nones in as well, you know. So I had somebody that\nwhen everybody was tired and everybody was sick of it and everybody just wanted to rest, and he'd still be there. So they had to do it. So that was for me, a win-win. So I had all the Americans, actually, I had Bobby Berland,\nand I had Michael Swain, and I had Ed Liddie, and I had them all coming to\nvisit me at different times. Jimmy was there. You know, they wanted to be the best. In the end, we had such\na great club atmosphere, they wanted to come for the hard work, and they knew that if they came, they were going to be dragged out and we were going to do physical training, and it was physical training\nlike they hadn't done before. But it wasn't just the physical training, it was the judo and the\nskill side of it as well. And so I always had a great empathy with the US team, Olympic team. So a lot of your Olympic medalists have been through with me, and so I'm proud of that, because we had some great times, and they're still great mates now. And so in New York, in\na couple of weeks' time, I'm going to have everybody\nwho's going to be there. They're all coming in.\n(Lex laughing) - All old friends. - All old friends. - And new friends. So what's a tough week\nlook like at your peak? Physical training, randori? Is there days off? Are you training like twice a day? - Twice a day. So we do the preparation training, we do the running, we do the weight training, we do the skills in the morning as well. The skills is for me, one of the biggest advantages that any full-time trainers can have because what happens is\nthat with most clubs, you're trying to fit\neverything into that hour and a half or two hours. You fit your skills, you fit your physical\ntraining and your sparring, and everything's in there all grouped in. So the biggest advantages\nof having a full-time group is that you can split your skills, and your skills lay your foundation. So the biggest advantage is being able to work specifically on things without having to worry about\ngetting to do your free, your randori or your sparring, or then you got to go out for\na run, you just do the skills. - When you talk about skills, say your specialty is a tai otoshi, are we talking about uchikomi,\ndoing a bunch of fists, the working with bands, are you doing throws? Are you actually just having conversations about specific tiny details of throws? What does skills mean? - All those things about doing\nyour repetition practice, making sure the repetition is correct. You know, there's good repetition. - So when we say good repetition, is it uchikomi, when you're just fitting the\nthrow versus doing the throw, where do you land on the value of both? - I'm getting it moving. So one of the biggest, most important things\nis getting it moving. If we do something static, again it's that static target. You need to get it moving. So you need to do a repetition. And also you need to do\nit correct repetition, because if you're doing\na hundred repetitions that are not correct, and repetitions under pressure, too much pressure, without somebody overseeing those skills to make sure that you correct the skills, because if you're doing a skill, if you're doing it 99 times\nincorrectly, all right, then repetition doesn't make perfect. Repetition makes permanent. So you've got to make it as\nperfect as you possibly can. So, actually, that skills group there is the most important thing, and what I used to do is oversee it. So I'd oversee it to make sure\nthat it was done properly. - So you're watching the footwork, you're watching the gripping, and then just constantly adjusting. - I'll give you an example, Jimmy Pedro. Jimmy was one of the hardest. When he was 19 years of age, right? So he was always asking\nme to practice, always. So he's always on me all the time. So I do groundwork with him, and could I put him on his back? No, I was all on him, and he'll tell you, but he was just, wouldn't go. He was just. He was going to be great, without a doubt. All right? So I wanted everybody\non with him, everybody. So everybody went on with him, you know, and so they only improved their game, and it improved him. And then with small technical things that have stayed with\nhim that we were doing with the juji gatame that\nwas passed on to Kayla and then gone on to Rhonda, and it's all small things\nthat I can see sometimes that it's passed on. - What about the tai otoshi? He said he learned a\nlot from you, from that. - [Neil] And he does it differently. - And so I should mention that's\none of the trickier throw. I mean, I still don't\nunderstand it. (laughs) - It is a tricky throw. - I don't understand. So, for people who don't know, it, boy, how would you even explain it? It doesn't make any sense. When you just look solo, the movement you make is quite simple, but how you get person to be off balance, how you actually get them to be thrown, and when you do throw it successfully, it looks like a whipping\nmotion that's effortless. It makes no sense. - It makes no sense, (Lex laughing) other than it's every technique\nstarts with the hands, so it's what we call kuzushi. And you're pulling somebody off balance, getting them moving, pulling them off balance. Tai otoshi means body drop. So it's basically two legs\nacross your partner's body. I've got my back to you, all right? And I've already pulled you\noff balance with my hands. And then I'm going to just flex my legs up just as you're coming onto my back, and then you're going to go over if I coordinate it all right. If it doesn't get coordinated right, then you're going to come right on my back and try to rip my arm off, you know? So, yeah, gotta get it right. - What was, if you can\nconvert it into words, some secret ingredients that allowed you to pull it\noff at the highest levels, the tai otoshi? - The hands start every technique. So getting the repetition\nright, first of all. So to get the repetition\nright, you need a good partner. So actually training your partner to react in the right way is just as important\nas learning the throw. So actually, what happens is, we could get a lesson of beginners. We teach the throw, and then go, \"Right, off you go.\" And 90% of them will get it wrong because their partner's not\nreacting in the right way. So half of it is to get the\nperson to react as they should. So if I was doing it with you, you and I, first thing I'd teach you to do is to react the way I want you to react, and then I'd react the way\nthat you want me to react. So then we'd have success with it, rather than you leaning\nback in the wrong way or resisting or frightened\nyou're going over. So, actually, that's why\nnine times out of ten, people get the technique wrong. - It's actually fascinating to me because in the United States, where I came up, judo, I mean, the level of judo is not comparable to the level of judo in\nthe rest of the world. Of course, the Pedro Center\nis an exception to that. - [Neil] Certain athletes, yeah. - Certain athletes. When I trained recently with Jimmy Pedro, it's like even the 16-year-old-kids\nare just all deadly. So it was terrifying. But I remember the Russian National Team came through Philadelphia. And one of the things\nthat really impressed me is just how much easier judo was, training judo with them. They moved correctly as uke, as the people getting thrown. Every aspect of their\nbody movement was correct in terms of it felt right\nto be throwing them, to be training with them. Everything about the gripping, about the position of their hips, about the shoulder, everything. It was fun, it was easy. And I always felt like I was learning. So I think all of that\nis loaded in, I guess, into proper training. So you're developing through the throws. You're developing the right technique. - Yeah, you have to develop between, I always had training\npartners that I trained with up to each Olympic Games, and we worked together for the, we did the skills together, and then we worked together in order to make techniques work, and we got it moving\nas quickly as we could. And one of the worst things that I see is, and I see a lot of YouTube\nstuff with coaches. - Here we go. - Don't even start me on that. Don't even start me on that. But, you know. (Lex laughing) - What? - You're laughing because you know what\nI'm talking about, right? - Yeah, no I'm actually laughing because I'm enjoying you talking trash. (Lex and Neil laughing) But talk about technique. - Yeah, just, well, the coaches and the\nclipboard guys, you know, with the clipboards and the stopwatches, and they got these kids\nrunning up and down the mat and then doing Uchikomi of something that technically\nincorrect ten times, and then running up and doing\nanother ten at the other side, and actually mixing everything together, and it's just a mess. - [Lex] Yeah, technique is important. - Just technical mess. - That said, some of it\nis conditioning-type stuff that you were doing. So what is like the hardest type of physical conditioning you were doing? - Probably ran too much. You know, when I was a kid, if I could go back now,\nI wouldn't run as much. And I ran hard and I ran strong. And I remember doing\nLondon Marathon one time, and I said, \"I'm never\ngoing to do it again.\" I never. But I ran, you know, and I was trying to, the problem was when I\ndid the London Marathon is I was trying to beat three hours. - It's that desire to win.\n- It's totally insane. You know, it was insane. And I went out through half marathon in what I thought was a good time. Anyway, I got to 16, 17\nmiles and totally blew. - So you went out too fast.\n- Yeah, I went out too fast. - And then you just wanted to keep going. - I died, absolutely. I died, Lex.\n(Lex laughing) I got in. I crossed the line. I remember seeing this\nbridge over there, right? And the bridge, it was the finishing line over the bridge. And I had to get over. It was the longest bridge\nI've ever, ever walked over. Like walk, run. So I got over the bridge, and I took one step\nover the line like that. And there was a guy over there, and he was trying to rush\neverybody through, you know, and he was going, \"Come\non, come on, come on. There's people behind you.\" Get your hands off me. (Lex laughing) I said, \"Get your hands off me now.\" Like that, because\nwe're going to fall out, and I couldn't move. I couldn't move. I was white. - And it's amazing that you made it to the finish line, though. - I did. I got over there, and yeah, Donald Duck\npassing me was a tell. - Oh, there was a person\ndressed as Donald Duck? - Donald Duck, yeah. But the thing was, I\nstill crossed over 3:38. I crossed over 3:38, but I lost 38 minutes\nin the last four miles. - To that bridge. Longest bridge ever. So you regret the run. - So anyway, I would do the running a little bit differently, but we ran, we ran hard, we did the weight training, we did good weight training. It was all conditioned. So, I mean, it was never the\nsame training all the time. So it was always, we'd have certain phases building up. It was scientifically done. It wasn't just out there\nrun, weight training, judo, same judo all the time. It was always pretty scientific. - Good variety. - It was a good variety. And it had build up, and it had a speed phase,\nand it had a power phase, and it had like a base condition. - What about the randori? Was there a method to the madness there? - [Neil] Yeah.\n- How much randori did you do? - A lot. So the most important\nthing for me, I mean, I see now that there's a lot of people out there that are\nnot getting enough randori. They're not randori-ing enough. And there's a lot of\nsports science people, and they're running and\nthey're weight training, and they're doing it all to death, and there's not enough judo. And the only ones, like you have a look at some of the Eastern Bloc countries that are getting together, they're having these mass camps, and the Japanese, they have just massive people\nthat they can do there. They're doing probably\n50, 60 randoris a week. - Wait, what? - 50 or 60 a week? - Wow. - The average person is getting together. I mean, when I was doing randoris, when I went to Japan, it was just purely for 60 randoris a week. - How much is each one, how long is it? - So they were five minutes then. They're four minutes now. - But that's a lot, especially given the level\nof the competition there. - Well, you can do it in Japan,\nbecause it's fairly light. If they throw you, they throw you. You throw them. - There's like a level of, like you're moving at close to 100%. But the actual power and the\nforce is not quite there. - Different in Korea. Korea was harder. It was more physical. So you couldn't do 50 randoris in Korea. You'd die. Yeah. So you do 30. - 50 to 60 randori, wow. - But you need the randori. And so I chase the randoris. So I chased them into training camps. I chased them all over my country. So I was getting 40 to\n50 a week in my club, and then I would go to\ntraining camps and add more. And I honestly don't think\nthat they do enough now, a lot of countries. - Somebody who doesn't know,\nrandori is live training. - Yeah, sparring. - Was there a few people you remember that were just really tough to go against? You mentioned Goldtooth. Is there others like him? - Goldtooth was pretty horrific. - [Lex] Yeah. (Lex and Neil laughing) - He was. - [Lex] Well, you got him in the end. - He did pretty all right. I got him in the end. And, yeah. (Lex laughing) - Is there, I suppose I should say not just tough, but just good training\npartners that you liked? - Great training partners. I remember Nishida. And Nishida was, I mentioned him earlier,\nsaid he was one of the best. I mean, he was just\nsuch a great technician. So I would go there to his dojo, and he'd ask me to practice, and he'd finish the practice, and you know that he would\nalways say, \"Another one. We'll do another one.\" So you'd go, \"Ah, yeah,\" because you had to make out that you weren't that bothered that you had to do another one. So you do another one back to back, and then he goes, sometimes, \"Let's do another one.\" So he'd end up doing 15\nminutes with the same guy who could possibly throw you at any time. And that was hard, so. But I remember those particular guys, and there were plenty of those. - What do you do with the exhaustion that\nyou're feeling in those? Like, how deep did you go, in terms of? - You have to dig deep. And I think that that was the great thing about having certain, like European training\ncamps were more physical. So I remember that we would\nhave European training camps where you'd fight Germans, and then the Dutch, and then the French, and then the Russian, or the. You'd have all sorts different styles and people there to fight. And that was something. Then you'd have to dig\nin at a different place, come out of there. - Where do you go mentally? How many times have you gone there where you're really in deep waters, exhaustion-wise, in competition actually? - Competition, it's happened. So sometimes you go past where your forearms are absolutely blown. I remember the final of a\nCzech tournament that we had, and I fought a Frenchman in the final, and my forearms were so blown I couldn't shake his hand, you know? And then I remember they\nwere solid, absolutely solid, and they had lactic acid in them. And I remember I stood on the rostrum and they were giving me things, and I couldn't grip them properly. So I was saying, \"Put it under my armpit.\" Or, you know, chin like that, trying to hold it.\n(Lex laughing) I couldn't hold anything, you know? And so there are times when I\nreally had to go really deep. I remember fighting two East Germans the same day one of the competitions, and the number one and the\nnumber two East Germans, and that was another day where\nI had to really dig deep. - That's the, the fascinating thing about some of these tournaments is if you go full distance\non several matches in a row, the way you're seeing in the finals are two people that have\nfought a lot that day. - Yeah. And we have golden score now, so we see a lot of guys that\ngoing into golden score, and they've done one\ncontest of four minutes, and then they go another four minutes, and then we've had some go\ninto a third four minutes. This is all back to back. It might be in the first round. It might be in the final. And we've got some now that are coming out and you can see the stats and the ones that win in golden score. So we got Japanese, Hashimoto. He's the Japanese representative now, instead of Ono, because Ono's finished. So Hashimoto's coming out. He was in a tournament last week. - Is there anything to look up? - Yeah, just have a look at him. So Hashimoto's in white here. All right. And, there's a great example there. (Lex laughing) Well, I'm glad we got onto that, so, I mean, he has got\ngreat technique, Hashimoto. - Effortless, effortless. - There's the tai otoshi. So you can see exactly\nwhat we're talking about, that great timing. And again, sometimes he\nbacks them up to the edge, and then he'll wait for them\nto come back in towards. They don't want to step\nout to get a penalty. - I guess that's a cross grip tai otoshi or did I see that wrong? - Yeah, cross grip, different grips, great examples there. Just what we were talking about. (Lex and Neil laughing)\n- They make it look so easy. Wow. - So he's going to be their\nrepresentative at 73 kg. Look at him back him up again, and again, just catching him as he pushes back. - So push, push, push, and then. - Yep, action-reaction at his best there. And that slight change of direction, he sometimes goes down\nonto his knee there, which is seoi otoshi. It turns from tai otoshi,\nwhich is springing up, to seoi otoshi, which is going down. - Oh, the title of the video is, \"His Tai Otoshi is a Work of Art.\" - Yeah, this is him at his best, showing him doing what he does best. But he had to go three times\ninto golden score last week and dig deep and lost one of them, I think. - But you're still going at it. You talk about all\nthose training sessions. Niki, your wonderful wife, told me that you were looking, you were going all over\nlike from Target to Target looking for workout clothes, because your luggage got lost because you had to get a workout in. - Yeah, you know what, I just, I realize that if I'm\na miserable git, right, then she'll get me to get me into the gym. And the thing is that I'm better if I get in there for an hour and I just do something. At least 30, 35 to 40 minutes cardio, and then I do some weights\nand more high repetitions. It's not so much heavyweights now, but more functional. - I mean you travel all over the world for the commentary of these competitions, so is it sometimes a challenge to figure out how? - Well, during Covid, then they closed all the gyms but we were still going out. We were one of the first ones out. The judo were some of the first out. The competitions were behind closed doors. So we were in the hotel, the gym was closed, so we couldn't use the gyms. So we had to look for other\nways that we could work out. So most of the hotels that we were in were high-rise hotels. So we were in the steps. We were doing the steps\nright the way up, you know? So I started it. And so I started off with me going up, and then one or two of the others, and the referees started to go up with me. So in the end we'd have this trail of people going up the steps and down, and every place we went\nto we had the steps. So yeah, that was an\ninteresting situation. So we were sick of steps in the end."

      "text": "- What advice would you give to beginners, people starting out in judo, how to develop their game, how to find the beauty in the\nsport and the art of judo? - If you put ten people\nin a room and said, \"Right, get on with it,\" you'd have mayhem, right? And I think that whatever\nsport you're doing, you need good instruction, good teaching, and a good club atmosphere, somewhere that's not so intense that winning is the only thing. And I think that if you look at 90% of the people that practice martial arts are doing it for pleasure, so they want to get pleasure. So you need a club that's\ngot a bit of a mixture. You know, they've got a direction to go into competition if they want, and then the rest, it's for fun and to enjoy it, but with really good instruction, because with really good instruction and a good foundation and a good base, you get more enjoyment\nbecause you have more success. And let's be honest, you know, the more success we have with something, the more we like it. - Yeah, and great technique is a way to really discover the beauty of the art. And so great teaching is\nreally important there. - Great teaching is so important. - What about, what does it take to get from the early days when you start judo to world-class level? - I think that with most, I mean, you do hear, don't you, if somebody's been doing\njudo for eight years and then they're in, and I think it happened, one of the French, Tcheumeo, she went to the Olympic Games in 2012, and she'd been doing judo for eight years, but then she started to lose, you know, so she had a relative success early on. The Olympics was one of them. She got a silver medal, but then she went off the boil and then she came back. And now she's been there for, she's still competing, and she's been there for well\nover 13 years at the very top. So I think that any foundation, it's like anything, if you lay a really solid foundation, generally it lasts longer. - Yeah, well, that foundation again, is that technique, or is there, what does it take to\nbuild that foundation? - I think technique, you get away with murder, you know? (Lex laughing) - [Lex] Yeah. - With technique, you can get away with\nhaving bad condition, but I mean, you get found out in the end, but you can you can go out and you can win certain things by doing really nice technique, but I think if you've got the mixture, if you've got the whole package, then you can go the whole way. - So for people who somehow don't know, you've commentated some of the\ngreatest judo matches ever. You've done Grand Prix. You've done all these events, Olympics, Championship, everything. So what, just looking\nat the history of judo, what stands out to you? What events stand out to you? What are some good memories\nthat pop to your head? - I think some of the Paris\ntournaments are amazing because the crowd, they're there, you know? They're on the mat. They're all judoka. They're well-educated to the sport. Every time somebody twitches, you know, they're very biased towards their own, which kind of you expect. But sometimes I haven't been\nable to hear myself speak, and that's very unusual. You know, you've got headphones\non and you're blocked out, and sometimes Teddy Riner's\nbeen walking out there, and the crowd are going crazy, and they're on their feet\nwhen somebody twitches. And then you get the crowd silencers. We had one of those last week, you know, everybody's cheering\ntheir man, and then, bang, their man goes over. - And they're just silent. (laughs) - Silence, nothing like that. And of course, we were commentating. We were going, \"That was a bit of a crowd silencer.\" But, yeah, that happens. - Yeah, that is the surprising thing that, at least it was to me, that Paris and France\nis really big on judo. - Massive. And there's always surprises. You know, it's like, Paris is great. In Japan for the Olympic Games, the biggest surprise\nwas Ono getting beaten in the team event. Now, Ono's the greatest\njudo man, pound for pound, probably one of the best. And he won the Olympic title. And then they went into the\nteam event against France, and Ono lost to a, he's not run-of-the-mill German, but the German, you know, he wasn't certainly Olympic titlist, and beat Ono. - Yeah, well, the team\nstuff is fascinating. - [Neil] Yeah, fascinating. - It changes the dynamics\nof the whole thing. And I mean, it's funny you say Paris. It really makes it a really big deal that this Olympics is being held in Paris. - And they'll be the team\nto beat, French team, because they have the best\nbalance of the weight categories. They have the best\nbalance with their people that are World and Olympic Champions and qualified men and women. So three men, three women. They have the best balance out of anybody. - And an educated audience. - Educated audience. Home ground. - It's gonna be awesome.\n- It's gonna be a mat. - [Lex] It's gonna be super fun.- - It will be super fun. - Are you nervous? - [Neil] Yeah. - All right. (laughs)\n- [Neil] Do you get nervous? - I get nervous. - [Neil] I do as well,\nI get really nervous. - I'm nervous right now. (laughs) But, you know, given, especially because it's the Olympics, and you don't want to, you want to celebrate people properly. And it's everything for them. - [Neil] Yeah. - And a lot of people, especially like the finals matches. - [Neil] Yeah. - It'll be watched millions of times, the highest of stakes, all of this. - Played over and over. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I find that with mine, I'm now a little bit\nmore careful with like, so I'll celebrate a massive throw and then have empathy to\nthe one that's been thrown, because it's not the best\nfeeling in the world, especially in Olympic Finals. Can you imagine that? - Yeah. - It must be terrible. - It must be terrible, yeah. - Just reflecting. So, no, I have a bit of empathy there, and I just try and say the right things, because they always do\ncome up to me and say, \"You commentated my fights.\" - Yeah, you're the voice\nof the biggest triumphs and the biggest tragedies\nfor these athletes, for the world that watches\nand admires these athletes. - No pressure. - You're the voice. Don't screw it up, Neil. - Don't screw it up. - Your voice is in my\nhead when I watch these. You know, it's fascinating. It's fascinating, but\nyou're a master of it. It's a huge honor that\nyou would talk with me. Thank you for everything you've\ndone for the sport of judo, for the Olympics, for just sports in general, just celebrating greatness\nin all of its forms. Thank you for talking\ntoday, and keep going. I can't wait to listen to you in Paris. - Thank you for having me, and it's just been an\nhonor to be here with you. - Thanks for listening to this\nconversation with Neil Adams.

He is a World Champion, two-time Olympic silver medalist, five time European champion, and often referred to\nas the voice of judo, commentating all the major events, World Championships and Olympic Games, highlighting the drama, the triumph, the artistry of the sport of judo, making fans like me feel the biggest wins, the biggest losses, the\nsurprise turns of fortune, the dominance of champions\ncoming to an end, and new champions made, always speaking from the heart. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Neil Adams. You are a five-time European champion, World Champion, two-time\nOlympic silver medalist. Let's first go to the 1980 Olympics. Where was your mind? What was your preparation like? What was your strategy\nleading into that Olympics? - That was my first Olympic Games, so my preparation was\na little bit different to how it was the '84 and\nthe '88 Olympic Games. And I'd kind of done part\nof the preparation as well for '76 Olympic Games. I wasn't quite old enough for those, but I was first reserve. So in 1980, I'd had four years' build up, and I was hungry, and I was one of these young athletes, and I see them so often\nnow that was developing, and, you know, full of. I won't say I was full of myself, but I was certainly\nconfident of my ability, and I wanted to conquer the world. And I'd had a couple\nof really tight matches with the current Olympic World Champion, so I knew that there was a possibility that I could get there\nfor the '80 Olympics. So building up to the 80\nOlympics was quite interesting because I was kind of\ncoming through the weights and I was halfway in between\nthe 71 kilos weight category and the higher weight\ncategory of 78 kilograms. And I had got third place at\nthe '79 World Championships the weight below, fought the whole year at\nthe higher weight category, didn't lose a contest, so I'd beaten everybody in the world. And then I had to make decision as to whether to drop to the weight below because I was seeded in the weight below. It was a different seeding then, so I decided to drop into the weight below because I was seeded in the top four. And as it happens, I think it was probably\nthe worst decision I made. (Lex laughing) Well, simply because, I mean, it was the only contest that I lost was the final of the\nOlympic Games in that year. - So you're a young kid, what, like 19, 20 at that time? - Yeah.\n- Full of confidence, vigor. So the decision to cut weight, how hard was it for you to cut\nweight to the 71 kg division? - I've got to say that it was the hardest, because as I was going up, I was, you know, it was 73, then it was 74 kilos, 75. So I was moving through\nthe weight category. It wasn't like I was stuck in the middle and then I dropped the\nodd time to compete. It was literally going up in\nweight by a kilo every month. And then by the time I came to a month or two before the Olympics,\nit was really hard. Fought the European championships at the higher weight\ncategory and won that. And so everybody that was\non the Olympic were rostrum at the Olympic Games was on my rostrum at the\nEuropean Championships. So was it a mistake? Yeah, because I didn't\nhave my diet sorted out. My nutrition was appalling. And when I, you know, it wasn't as kind of readily available as it is now for the nutrition. And I would say that if\nanything lost me that final, other than the fact that I was fighting\nsomebody who was terrific, you know, he was an\nexcellent, brilliant athlete, but it definitely didn't help that my nutrition was not very good. - Okay, so you lost to Ezio Gamba. There's probably a lot\nof that we could say about that particular match. Maybe, let's zoom in. What were your strengths and weaknesses, judo-wise in that Olympics? You said you haven't\nreally lost the match. You won the European\nChampionship leading into it, but if you had weak spots, okay, you already said diet, but specifically on the\nmat in terms of judo. - I think that none of\nthe fights lasted time going into the final, you know, so I won fairly quickly. And every match by ippon,\nyou know, way before time. - Do you remember how, do you remember how you won the matches? - I won them by throw, a couple of throws for ippon, and then armlock for ippon. Semifinal was an armlock against\nthe East German, Krueger. And, yeah, I was flying through. - What were the throws? Do you remember? - Tai otoshi, uchi mata, my favorite kind of tokui waza, were my favorite throws. And then juji gatame as well, which was a juji gatame roll, against an East German\nwho I'd beaten before, but always had a really tough match, but managed to beat him well. - So you had a beautiful\nexhibition of Japanese-type judo in the first two matches. You threw people, and then\nyou also did the newaza, you armbarred a person. Great, so going into the final, what are the weaknesses\ngoing into the final against the Italian? - Like I say, taking nothing away from\nhim as a great athlete and a brilliant judo man, and left, which wasn't good for me. That was a definite no, because I hated fighting lefties. Still do, but I'll tell\nyou why in a minute. - [Lex] Great. - It's one of those. But I think as I went through the contest, we had an eight-hour break from\nthe semifinal to the final. They took us back to the Olympic Village, then we had to come back in, and then we had to start a warm up again, so I kind of lost my momentum. I had to start again,\nand I never, I didn't. I just didn't. I had a job to get going. I got halfway through, started to rescue a dying match, and I was kind of one step, half a step behind all the way through, so never really got into it. - So why do you hate fighting lefties? And lefties are, we should say, overrepresented in terms\nof the high ranks of judo. I don't know why that is. - Well, you know, the\nthing is about a lefty is a lefty will have more opportunity to fight right-handers, because, I mean, 70% of the population are\nright-handers, 30% left. So they get to fight more right-handers, and it's just a fact, that happens. So the thing that they hate\nis fighting left against left. They don't like it, left against left, whereas a right-hander will\ngo right against right. But the opposite is awkward for me because just simply I like\nto go onto the sleeve, and then I like to dominate the grips. But the actual angle of the opponent wasn't what I wanted, so I had to work hard,\nreally hard against it. - What happened in that match? - It was a split decision in the end. And so to lose an Olympic final on a split decision is pretty, you know, it's something that's still on my mind. And I think that it's a strange one because I can still wake up, that one and four years\nlater at the Olympics, because I was silver medalist at the Olympics four years later as well. And, yeah, it still haunts me. - Do you sometimes wake up and think like, \"Man, I should have eaten better.\" - Yeah. - Or maybe a specific\ngrip that you're like, \"Ah, I shouldn't have taken that grip.\" - I do. I mean, the diet side of it, it's difficult to really\nadmit that, isn't it? That you went to an Olympic Games and the one thing that you\nreally sucked at, right, was one of the most important things now at world-level sport, where you've got the nutrition. We've got it. You would think that most\npeople have got it sorted, but there's still people making mistakes and still people that haven't\ngot it totally sorted. - And then there's people\nlike Travis Stevens, who I think doesn't care. He'll just have atrocious nutrition and he just makes it work. I think the way he spoke about it is you can't always control nutrition, so it's best to get good\nat having crappy nutrition. - That's a good way of looking at it. I never, yeah, maybe that's what I did. - Exactly, exactly.\n(Neil laughing) Do you remember what you were eating? Are we talking about like candy, or? - Yeah, well, I got a sweet tooth in, but it wasn't really. I mean,\nI didn't have a lot of money at that particular time either, so the diet wasn't steak\nand good nutritional salads and things like that. I did what I thought was best without proper advice. And the crazy thing is that I\nhad such good advice as well when it came to kind of fitness training and things like that. We're quite ahead of our time, and we really had it nailed as far as the conditioning was concerned. The judo training as\nwell was way in advance because I was a good trainer and I trained more than most. I would, I can honestly say that. And it probably got me away with a lot. - Where was your mind, so mental preparation,\ngoing into that Olympics? You said you were confident, but is there some preparation\naspect behind that confidence? - I think in the early days, I didn't think I was going to lose. I never thought it was possible to lose. And I think that I went into\nevery contest expecting to win. So when it didn't quite go my way, I didn't lose that many contests, so the only ones I lost were in the final of\nthe World Championships or in the final of the Olympic Games. So I didn't lose that many. I never lost a European title. I had seven golds at\nEuropean Championships, five Seniors, two at\nJuniors under twenties, and I never lost a final, so it was. And then I only lost\ntwo on a split decision, so it was, I didn't lose that many. And my attitude was that\nI wasn't going to lose and I couldn't lose, so I was always surprised when I did, when something happened. - In \"Neil Adams, A Life in Judo,\" written in 1986, you wrote, \"Ever since I can remember, I have wanted to win. It wasn't the ordinary\nfeeling that children have when they take part in their first primary school\nsack race on a grass track, or even the keen determination of a young swimmer prepared to train early in the cold winter mornings in order to make it into the county side. With me, the desire to\nwin was, and still is, as much a part of me as my arms and legs. In other words, it wasn't something I\nlearned as I grew older, but rather was deeply rooted in me. Perhaps this competitive instinct\nis the greatest difference between my public image and\nthe view from the inside.\" So people see the kindness,\nthe warmth you have, the charisma, the excitement, but there's this big\ndrive to win inside you. So what's behind that? Can you just speak to that drive to win and how that contributed to\nyour competitive journey? - [Neil] When I look back now. - There's a lot of years\nago, we should say. - It is a lot of years ago. - Is that true or are\nwe just being poetic? - It's not far off. No, it's not, when I think about it now, because I'd like to think that\nI'm a different person now. And since I've kind of calmed down, I see athletes now, and I see them, and their kind of arrogance. They're walking. It's a strut, you know, and it's a kind of a confidence, isn't it? And as we're older and\nas I've become older, I've calmed down. But, you know, it doesn't\nmatter what I'm doing. It's still that will to win, and I'm much better at\nmasking it now if I don't. But it still bothers me as much. - You're talking about, I don't know, even just\nstupid, silly things, like, I don't know, a game of pool or something\nlike this, or just anything? - Yeah, I'm still trying to win. Like so my son loves to, he loves to play me at bowls, because I'm useless, and I just can't throw a straight bowl. So he loves playing me at that, but it bugs me that I'm not better, and there are certain things that I do. (Lex laughing) It really bugs me when I'm not good at it. And I guess it's one of the reasons that, long after I'd finished competition, judo, people still want to train with you, and even at kind of an\nolder age, even now, if I do it in a seminar, or they're still, \"Do you still do, do you want to still go? And can I feel it?\" And one of the things\nthat's in me is that I just, all the way up to 40 years of age, so from 30, when I finished competition, up to 40, I could still train with the best, and I could still go with anybody. And then when 40 hit, kind of things started\nto fall off a little bit, and I used to get either my\nhips or my legs and my knees, and I realized that I\nhad to pick my practices, and that rankled as well. And I had to then just\ncalm it down a little bit. Otherwise I was going to be injured, and I was going to be, you know, it's not a good thing\nwhen you're getting older and you've still got the\nsame competitive mind, but things change. - So it's still there. You get on the mat,\nprobably even now, right? You get on the mat with a World Champion. You still, the current World Champion, there's still a little part of you. - Oh, yeah, yeah. - Could I still toss this guy? Kids these days are soft. (laughs) - I do think, well, you know what? Some of these athletes, I mean, I give you a prime example, right? Is Ilias Iliadis, all right? I mean, he is a monster, right? And you just, of course you couldn't, because just at 60\nsomething, you couldn't. But you like to think that you could. - Yeah, you could. You never know. You'll never find out. - You know what you would do? What you can do is you\ncan cause them problems and they feel it immediately, but you'd last a minute, you know. - So you've trained with Ilias Iliadis. I've gotten a chance to\ntrain with him as well. He's a really nice guy, really great. - He's a good guy. He trained with me. We were training together. Every hotel that we used to go into, we'd end up in the gym\ntogether and we'd train. And this one time he was in there and he just wanted somebody\nto grab and grip hold of. And so we ended up doing\nthis kind of grappling in the middle of the people\ndoing weight training and different things, watching these two madmen doing. I'm glad we weren't on a\nmat at that particular time, but good fun. - What do you think about that guy? He, like you, achieved a lot of success when he was young. - 17, you imagine that? 17, 18 years of age, and he's able to compete with the men. There's not many men can do that. And it doesn't happen very often. It happens later with the men, and often they're not\nphysically as developed as they, so from me, for example, I fought Nevzorov who was World and Olympic Champion. He was the current World Olympic Champion. They sent me to the European\nChampionship Senior at 17. That doesn't happen very often. And I fought. I pulled Nevzorov, so I fought Nevzorov. And I had him really worried, because he expected, without a doubt, to come out, throw this kid, a junior. - He was thick and shredded. - He was shredded. There's a picture of him in his judogi, and his judogi is just cut, and he looks the business, and there's me in this baggy, - [Lex] Skinny kid. - Yeah, skinny kid\ninside this baggy thing. And the thing was, is that the more he tried, and the harder he tried, and the more he panicked, the further it went away from him. And so, you know, of course he got the decision at the end, and deservedly, but I worried him, and so for me, that was a massive step forward, because a year later I\nwas starting to fill out, and two years later I was competing for the Olympic title, so.\n- I don't know if I remember, but Ilias Iliadis is interesting, because even at 17, I feel like he was doing big throws, like literally lifting them with the hips. - Just rips them out the ground. And I was saying to Niki, my wife, she said, \"What would you do now that was different than\nthe way you did then?\" And I said, \"I never had any pickups.\" I didn't, that's not what we did, but you have a look at the young Ukraines or the the young Russians or the young Eastern Bloc Mongolians, and they're ripping people out the ground. I mean, it's just different style of judo, and it just looks different. But now they're starting to do traditional-style judo as well. - So can you speak to that? What are the different styles of judo? So for you, you mentioned\nuchi mata, tai otoshi, these, how would you describe them? They're like these effortless, less lifting off the ground and power and strength and explosion, and more timing and position, movement. - Yeah, momentum. - Momentum, all this kind of stuff that's more traditionally associated with Japanese judo, because for Japanese judo, the traditional judo, you're supposed to throw people in a big way without much effort. - And of course, 1990, we saw the introduction of all\nthese Eastern Bloc countries. There were so many more, I mean, it was Soviet Union when I was competing. And then, of course, in\n1990, everything changed. And then there were so many\nmore of them out there, different countries, that their wrestling styles\nwere introduced into judo. Put a jacket on them,\nand let's get into judo. So judo kind of changed shape. It changed shape from\nthis upright, standing, and having to know the technicalities of how to get a body\nthat's weighing 14 stone, or whatever it is, up into the air, and using the momentum and the balance and the direction and the skill to do that and knowing how to do it\nand how to use movement. And then you get the wrestlers, and the leg picks, and the double-leg,\nsingle-leg, double-legs. By 1995, judo was bent over. It was the IOC that went to IJF, International Judo\nFederation, and they said, \"You've got to change this, or we're just going to\nhave one wrestling style. It looks like wrestling\nwith judo jackets on, so you either change it or we're going to take one of you out.\" - By the way, we should sort of clarify. When we say people are bent over, that's usually how you\nsee freestyle wrestling. Wrestlers are more bent over\nto defend the legs and so on. And traditional judo\npeople are more standing up because that's the position for which you can do the big throws and all that kind of stuff. But I think the other case\nto make for banning leg grabs is a lot of people are\nusing it for stalling and not for beautiful big throws and all that kind of stuff. So it's not just not to make\nit different from wrestling. It's also like you want\nto maximize the amount of epic throws and dynamic judo and exciting stuff to watch. - Win by judo, not by wrestling. And I think that the ones\nthat were shouting about it were the wrestlers, right? Because they like to compete with both. They want to do both. They want to do their wrestling matches and then come into judo. So basically, I mean, what we've said is they learn to do judo and there's nothing stopping you then from doing both, right? But not from the other way around. All right, so rules always\ndictate development. They'll always dictate\nwhich direction it goes. So if you introduce a rule that states that you cannot dive at\nthe legs and just pick up, then you'll have to do it standing up. And also it increases the possibility of defense with the\nhips, because actually, good defense judo-wise, standing up, is with the hips as opposed\nto sticking your arms out and then sticking your backsides\nout there just to defend. All right? So if you attack me and I move\nmy body in the wrong place, so I'm in the wrong\nplace at the right time, so you don't hit the right target. And then also I use my hips, so again, it's a form of judo that was being lost. So now we got it back. - So let's go there. Let's speak about judo as if we're talking to a\ngroup of five year olds. So what is judo? What are some defining\ncharacteristics of judo as a sport, as a way, as a martial\nart, as a way of life, all that kind of stuff? - I think, when you say\nit as a way of life, I mean, I think the great\nadvantage that we have in judo, my young grandson, so\nI got two little boys that are three and a half years of age. They love going to our dojo. They love it, you know, so dojo was the first word that they used. It was one of the first. So when they come see\nus, see my wife and I, you know, it's like dojo. It's not grandma, granddad,\nyou know, it's dojo. So dojo, they take their\nshoes off going into the dojo, so they have respect for where they're at, and I think it has that\nkind of feeling that, like, I tried to build my dojo\nwith a feeling of reverence. It's kind of almost peaceful, you know? So I'm not religious, I'm\nnot a religious person, but I like going to old churches, because when I go into an old church, it doesn't matter what the\nreligion within the church, but there's a reverence in there. - Reverence is a good word. It feels like a really special place. No matter which dojo you go to, it's just you bow and there's a calmness\nbefore the storm of battle or whatever it is. (laughs) - And respect, look at the respect. We were just talking about it\njust before we came on air. We were just saying that\nwe very, very seldom do we have a situation where there is animosity\nother than them fighting. So I'm not saying that\nthey don't fight each other because sometimes it\ndoes turn into a brawl. And at the end, two people bow off and show their respect. And one of the things, so a champion, I see people winning events,\nand they're good judoka, they're excellent. They win World Championships, might even win the Olympic Games. But a great champion for\nme is somebody who treats, who does the right thing when they lose. So when you see them lose, that's when you see the true them. And actually, that was one of the biggest things that\nI had to really cope with. When I lost that Olympic Games in Moscow and also the one in Los Angeles, the hardest thing is when\nthe microphone is in there and you've got to be respectful and nice, and the hardest thing is to smile. But actually, some of the\ngreat champions, they'll go, \"That's just one match.\" I remember we've got one\ngreat champion, Agbegnenou. She's a five-time World Champion. She's an Olympic champion. She's favorite as well to\nget this Olympic gold medal. French, what a great champion she is, because she lost one of the matches. I mean, she'd come back, and she'd given birth, come back after giving birth, and everybody was going, \"Well, will she?\" And then she lost one of the matches on the way through, and she said, \"Don't be upset, you\nknow, it's just one match. It's just one contest. Next time I'm going to put it right.\" And she did put it right, and now she's back up there and she won the world title back. So these are great champions for me. - Yeah, I mean, that's\nthe right way to see it. But it's also tragic to lose the Olympic Games, you know. - Twice. (Neil laughing) Yes, it is tragic. And I do have sleepless nights. - I mean, that's the magic\nof the Olympic Games. Anything can happen. And your 1980 Olympics were\nvery different from the 1984. But if we just linger on the '80, and just your, where we're talking about, how much you wanted to win. Do you love winning or hate losing more? - I hate losing more, but I love winning. When I won the world title a year later and I had no doubt when\nI went into that day that I was going to be World Champion. No doubt. - So you won the '81 World Championship. - At the higher weight. - At the higher, the 78? - [Neil] Yes. - Kg. Actually, can we go there? What was going through your mind? You ended up armbarring\na Japanese fighter. I talked to Jimmy Pedro,\na friend of yours, somebody who said you were a\nmentor to him for many years, and he told me a bunch of\ndifferent questions to ask you. But he said that was\na really special time. That was a really special\ndominant run you had, and especially finishing with an armbar against as a Japanese player. So take me through that. What do you remember from that? - I think that it was,\nso my weight was better, I didn't have to lose weight. That was one thing. So the nutritional side\nwasn't as important, but probably it still wasn't\nas good as it could be, my nutrition. Although it was getting better and I was trying to eat the\nright things at the right time, but I still trained really well and I was so confident there going into that World Championships\nthat I could win it. I had no doubt in my mind\nthat I was going to win. But obviously, corner of\nyour mind you're thinking, \"Just don't make mistakes.\" But this is the incredible thing is that once you start to ask, I see contests change direction when I'm commentating, so I can see somebody who's in there just going forward, just trying to win. And that's a difference to somebody who's trying not to lose. And there's two different\nways there, you know, so sometimes when you, so when I was World Champion, then I had a period of time where every time I stepped out there, I was really afraid of losing. And I think that that's\nwhat happens later on in your competitive career. You know, the great champions\nmanaged to come through that. Teddy Riner is one of\nthose, you know, he just, he puts it out there and\nhe keeps beating them, so they can't take it away from him. You know, it's fantastic. - So stepping on the mat every single encounter\nyou're trying to win, you're looking for the grips, and with the intention to throw, throw big even when\nyou're ahead on points, all that kind of stuff. - That's a really good point, is that if you go ahead in a match and you look at the clock. It depends when you go ahead. So sometimes you can go\nahead in the first minute and you've still got three minutes to go. So I see the ones then that\ngo into, I don't want to lose, because they go into defensive mode. And then sometimes they\ncan lose it on penalties or something can go wrong and the other one comes on strong and then they can sneak the contest. And so it's really difficult. But when I was coaching, I was trying to always\nencourage that positive attitude for the full four minutes,\nfive minutes then. - I've competed a lot\nin judo and jiu-jitsu. I've always hated that part of myself. When I'm up on points by a lot, you look at the clock, and it's what you do when\nyou look at the clock, - I see. (laughs) - Minute and a half, you're really tired, and you kind of quit. You just defend. Yeah, and I hated that part about myself. - It's saying, \"Don't do it.\" - Well, as opposed to just go out in judo, that's for a big throw. Just keep going for the throw. In jiu-jitsu, it's go for the submission, like throw caution, like win in the real way versus on points. And I hated that part of myself. I mean, mostly underneath that is cowardice induced by exhaustion. - Exhaustion's the one, isn't it? But it is, isn't it? It's a mindset as well. So actually trying to get your mind positive\nall the way through. So, I mean, if you listen, when I commentate, is I say, I hope that they don't change the mindset and that they keep on and they are going forward all the time. And actually they're then\nmore difficult to catch. We had one just a couple of weeks ago, and he lost in the final\nsecond of the contest. Lost the final. He was the only one to score. He got penalized all the\nway up, two seconds to go, and stepped out of the area. But he went like that, thinking the bell was just going, and the bell went one second\nafter he actually stepped out. So he got penalized, lost the match, and lost all of the\npoints for qualification. So it was, you know,\nthat's paying high price. That's paying high price. - Yeah. I mean, there's a thin\nline between triumph and tragedy in those competitions, but especially at the Olympic Games. So let's just stick on\n'81 World Championship. What did it feel like to\nwin that World Championship? And also getting an armbar\nagainst a Japanese player. Jimmy told me your arms were exhausted. - Yeah, I mean, you just. The thing is sometimes when you're going, when it's competitive as well. Ours is a different intensity to jiu-jitsu where you can take time a little bit. Ours is bang. It's transitioning from standing down. You've got 10, 15 seconds to go in there. You go in 100%. It's a bit like running\nfull-out for 10 seconds, and then you've got to decide then, especially if they're defending it, whether you let it go, because when you get up\nand your forearms are blown and you've got lactic acid in there and you've still got to\ngrip up because, remember, ours is about gripping\nas well on the jacket. So if you can't grip up, then\nyou can't gain the advantage, then they can throw you. So you have to decide. So I had a massive attack on him, and we changed directions\nfour or five times, and then I wasn't going to let him go, but I still, when I was turning him there, I had to decide, am I going to go all\nout for this and just, or there has been occasions when I've kind of released\nit to just, you know, if I got a minute to go,\nand just lock out, yeah. - So what you're saying on the feet, there was a change of direction of all different kinds of attempts, and then you went to the ground. - [Neil] Yeah. - So what was that? Do you remember that\ndecision of like, okay, am I gonna finish this? - Yeah, I knew it. I just, as soon as I climbed his back, and then I thought, he's not going. He's not gonna. I'm not gonna let him up, you know, so I was just changing. - [Lex] Little voice in your head? - Something in my head\nwas going, \"Don't, don't. You know, just stick on him.\" And then it's always\nabout pressure on the arm, and I just, you know, and of course he was like that, defending. He was almost total bridge\ntrying to get out of it. - Did it start in turtle? And like, did you flip? - It started in turtle\nbecause I did an attack, came back out of the attack, and then he went on to his front, and then I was on his back, and then I started the whole thing. - [Lex] Saw an opening\nand you just went for it? - Just, it was an automatic transition. So, I mean, the transitions\nare what we teach, you know, because the ones that are quicker down with the transitions are\nthe ones that catch it. That's our newaza. You know, our groundwork is the transition from standing down to ground. It's very, you know, we don't have a situation where you can kind of work your way in. You are in or you're not in. You're standing, you know? So you've got to make sure that you're in. And so I had, I was just on his back like a leech, and I never let him go. - So that's where the armbars, that's where the attacks on the ground, which is called newaza, happens is it? In the transition. - [Neil] Yes. - At that level, at that\nhigh, world-class level. - Yeah, I mean, he was no muggy, though. I think he just got third place in the All-Japan Championships, which is all weight categories. So he wasn't a mug. He was strong. I'd fought him once before, and I knew, he was a lefty as well, which was really awkward for me. - Did it feel good? - Better for me than him. It did. It felt amazing, because it was almost\nlike all these things, disappointments and everything had kind of come to this one point where I was at last kind\nof Champion of the World. It's everything I said as a kid that I had no idea how difficult\nit was gonna be, you know? So as a kid, as a 14-year-old kid, I remember saying, \"I'm gonna be World Champion. I'm gonna be the best in the world.\" I had no idea how difficult\nthat was gonna be. - Well, there's wisdom to that, right? Like, there's power\nand stupidity of youth. - I like that. - Just like, I'm gonna be a World Champ. I'm gonna win this without\nknowing how hard it is. And then once you go after it, it's you're trapped. You're gonna have to do the work. - Yeah, well, I mean, you see it a lot with parents as well. You know, parents, our little Johnny is, he's amazing, and he's\nthis, that, and the other. And they have no idea what's out there. I remember the very first\ntime I stepped out, 1974, into the European Cadets, and I remember that we were fighting. I'd only ever fought in Great Britain. I was the top, I was\nunbeaten in the juniors, kids, and went out there, and there were these\ndifferent fighters out there that were treating me with total disdain. And I remember thinking, how dare they, you know? And I realized when I\ncame back from that event, there's other people out there. There's just a whole, and there are different levels of. Majority of people are just not informed as to what's out there and the different levels\nthat there are out there. - Do you remember like a certain opponent that for the first time,\nyou felt like, holy shit? - [Neil] Yeah. - Like somebody just gripped you up and you're like, this is, there's another level to this game. - Ezio was one of them, and I fought him, you know, and I beat him in the\nEuropean Championships. I beat him two times, and then lost to him in the Olympic Games two months after I'd beaten him in\nthe European Championship. - Wow. - Yeah, yeah. So that made it even\nmore difficult, right? - That's literally your\nnemesis there, wow. - Yeah, so that made it more difficult. And so Ezio was one, and getting hold of, I remember getting hold\nof Nishida of Japan, and he had me going up and down, and I just, I thought, wow, this guy is amazing, and I'd never fought, first time I ever fought\nJapanese in a major tournament, and I felt the danger. I always talk about the danger when we go out to Japan to train. I could go probably months\nwithout getting thrown in training here in Europe. And I go to Japan, and everybody's thrown you, and that's difficult to accept. And the reason that kind of danger and that kind of feeling of danger is something that puts a real edge on. So that was the first time, when I got a hold of Nishida, I thought, \"Oh, my God.\" This guy, it didn't matter which way he was turning like that. He had me stretched out, and I thought, I want to do this. And then I ended up\nfighting him again in Japan. - So that feeling of danger\nis really interesting. Like, I've, you know, I did randori with a lot\nof world-class people from different parts of the world, including Ilias Iliadis. And there's certain part,\nlike Eastern European judo, you feel like you're screwed\nthe whole way through. Like the gripping, you really\nfeel it in the gripping. - It's the gripping that does it. - But in with Japanese, like really good Japanese-style judoka, you don't, it's like, it's a terrifying calmness, but at least the experiences I've had, you don't really feel it in the gripping. You just feel like anywhere you step, you're getting thrown. It's a different. - It's a different thing isn't it? - It's a different thing. - So, I mean, mine was kind of a mixture. I liked it to be a\nmixture, because there was, the gripping is definitely the key point. So if you get high-level\nguys that are gripping up, and I always used to\nput this to the referees when we were doing referee seminars when we first started them. And I'd say, how many? Because, like, they would referee to their understanding of the match. So they were penalizing for\ncertain grips that were, you know, and actually, so as an ex-athlete, at high-level, I would say, \"Have you ever\ngripped up with high-level?\" All right. Because if you haven't, you need to do it, because then you will understand why they do certain things with the grips, because these guys are like, when somebody grips you, and you think, you know you're going to go. When Iliadis puts his arm\nover your back, all right, and you know you're\ngoing to go up and over, you know you're going to go\nover. You know, that's it. - It's a cool feeling. - Not for me. (laughs) - Well, I understand. But it's like, I mean, because it's not. It feels way more powerful than it should. - Yeah. - It's weird. I don't know. You want to attribute it to strength and all that kind of stuff. I mean, people say you have\nimmense upper body strength, but it's probably something else. It's like technique. It's some kind of weird. - It's a mix of everything. - Just like something hardened\nthrough lots of battles and randori and that kind of stuff. - [Neil] Yeah. - But it's cool that\nhumans are able to generate that kind of power. It's cool. - When I was, '84 Olympics. But I'm just gonna go\nthere now, just quickly. But there was, we had a freestyle wrestler. He's American, actually, but\nhe had English nationality. So he competed for,\nNoel Loban, his name is, and he competed for Great Britain. He got third place at the Olympics in '84. But he was training. We were training at Budokwai,\nand he was training. He came to do some judo,\nand he put jacket on. And of course, he was training with\nsome of the lower levels, and he was really handling himself well. And then he said, \"I need to feel,\" you know, when we did randori, so he did some randori with me, and I immediately thought, I gotta catch it. I gotta stop single leg and double leg. Because he was really quick, right? So strong as well, 90-something kilos. He was like, you know, he's a big guy. So I caught his sleeve, immediately caught and controlled him, and then he couldn't start, right? So he said, \"I needed\nto feel the difference.\" So then I thought, I better reciprocate this. So I said, well, you know, so we did the randori and I\nthrew him a couple of times. He said, \"I'm really glad we did that.\" So then I said, \"I need to\nfeel the difference as well.\" So we take the jackets off. So we took the jackets off. And he was a nightmare. This guy was a nightmare. And, like a monster, you know, he was like, single legging me, and it was just totally different. So it was like the jacket\nmakes a massive difference, huge difference to something. And people think it's just\na jacket that we're wearing, but it isn't. It's our only tool, actually. - Yeah, and it's control. I mean, it's a way of establishing control over another body. And it's a whole art form and a science. And I don't even know if\nyou understand it, really. You understand it sort of\nsubconsciously through time. - [Neil] Yeah. - Because there is so much involved, because pulling on one part of the jacket pulls other parts of the jacket, and like the physics of that is probably insane to understand. - It's absolutely insane. And then they changed the\nrules for a little while and they changed the rules\nso that you couldn't hold, certain grips were not allowed. They only allowed certain amount of time. And there were a lot\nof penalties for them. And then they had some of the ex-fighters into the referee commission. And so we were pushing for just let them grip,\nbecause that's our game. That's what makes us different. Again, if grip up with somebody. So they were on about Teddy Riner. Teddy Riner comes out, takes a sleeve, big arm over the top, and then he throws people. So they were saying, \"Yeah, but stop.\" You can't stop him doing it. This guy is six-foot nine, and he is built like Goliath, you know? - Yeah. - And not only that,\nhe's skillful as well. And he's got that mentality of a winner. He has got that mentality\nof a winner there. He just wins important matches. - And he goes over the top of the grip. Where does that land\nnow in terms of rules? Over the top? Because those are some of the most epic, awesome types of grips, just like over the top, just big grab. - Yeah, well, as long\nas they throw from it, so they can take any grip as long as you move them\nand then catch them, kind of action-reaction, really. You know, as long as you\ncatch them on the move, then you can do it. - So as long as you're\nnot using it to stall or that kind of stuff. - Yeah, you can't block out. So, I mean, so for example, if I've got dominant grip on you, and I just block out, and I just stop you attacking me. So then what? I get you three penalties, get you off, and you haven't done an attack. So you've got to stop that. You can't have that. - Yeah, yeah, definitely. You were the favorite to\nwin the 1984 Olympics, but you got silver. I watched that match several times. You probably have it playing in your head. So there is a nice change of\ndirection by your opponent, German, Frank Wieneke. - [Neil] Yeah. - It was a fake right uchi mata, and then to a left drop seoi nage. How did that loss feel? - Devastating is not enough really, because, you know, the strange thing was\ncoming into that Olympics, I was tired, really tired. So my mental state wasn't the best, wasn't certainly the same as it was coming into the previous. And I remember thinking, I just need to get this over with, and then I'm going to have a break and just have a rest. And that's totally the wrong attitude. It's just not good for\ngoing into an Olympic Games. And so I was coming in there\nwith a different mindset. And I remember every match that I had, I was winning well, but I was winning with\na struggle, you know, it was really not. I'd fought Nowak, and I\nwas pretty, of France, who was one of the strongest physically, that was in the quarterfinals. I beat Brett Barron by an ippon. I'd armlocked him. I won my first match by ippon as well. And then Michel Nowak I was fighting, of France, and I was lucky to win it. I was up. I would score on him, but I was like starting to defend, and just everything that\nI talked to you about, and then just about\nheld on, and then I won. So him and I were talking afterwards, some years afterwards, and he said, \"I was close, wasn't I?\" \"Yeah, but not close enough.\" (Lex laughing) I didn't mean it, but I had to say it. - [Lex] Of course, of course. - And no, he was right, and it was one of those. So it's through to the semifinal. I had fought Lescak in the semifinal, and I'd fought him in the\nsemifinal of the Worlds as well. I'd never gone time with him. I'd always beaten him\nfairly easily and by ippon, and that went time. So I was just glad to get it done. And I was in the final then against Frank Wieneke of Germany. And I'd beaten Wieneke before, but he was just a young\nGerman coming through. And when I started the final, I thought, right, I've just, and I started, all my techniques just\nthat little bit off. Nothing was coordinated. It was just, I can't really explain why\nit was just a little bit off. I see it so often now with a lot of the guys that are going for second, third Olympic Games, and I see their technique\njust not quite there, and they're struggling, and I know when they're, you know, I know what they're going through and I kind of empathize with them. - Well, you were, it felt like you were\ndominating that final. - I dominated it. Yeah, I was winning. And actually, if it had\nanother minute and a half, it would have been all over and I would have been Olympic Champion and it would have been done. He wouldn't have batted an eyelid, because he would have fought\nme really, really well, and he would have, you know, we talked about it afterwards, and he said, \"It was\njust my good day for me.\" And he knows, he was very respectful. This guy is very respectful. - He was surprised almost. I mean, not almost. He was very surprised and celebrating. - Yeah, jumping up and down. And, you can look at that, can't you go, well, it wasn't ippon, but\nwould I had got it back? I don't know. I think that actually\ntaking the pressure off, because that was another thing as well, pressure of being favorite, and I see that with a lot of\nthem. And the great champions, the ones that keep coming through. Krpalek, there's a guy. He can look very ordinary, and then comes the big tournament, and he'll win it. - The tragedy of the Olympic Games. I mean, you were the favorite. And just like that, like\nsplit moment, you lost it. - Split moment, devastating. And lived it probably not every day, but, Niki, my wife, will tell you that I've woken up in sweats, and I think they contributed as well, because I had a period of my life after where I was drinking too much, and I think kind of when I look back, kind of led into that kind\nof dark period of my life, and I never, ever, ever, did it go through my mind, anything else, but it definitely affected me. And I was on a downward kind of spiral in a lot of different ways, and would still even, you know, we have an amazing marriage, and we have an amazing family, and everything's great, but I still wake up sometimes, and I'll say, \"I've just\ndreamt, you know, that,\" and it's the same reoccurring dream where I'm trying to get somewhere and I'm trying to put it right, you know, and I've got this chance of putting this Olympic final right. You know, in this dream, I've\ngot a chance of doing it, but I can't get there and the traffic's stopping\nme or something stops me. And then I wake up and I'm sweating, and you think, \"What, after all this time, that's not possible.\" But it is, and it happens. - Yeah, I mean, in the match itself, there's that feeling\nfor me just watching it. Like you're going for throws, you're almost getting\nthere with the throws, and it's almost like he's going for a kind of crappy uchi mata and then you're just like\nstopping, you're blocking it. And all of a sudden, I mean, that's the beauty of the Olympics. He finds it in himself to switch like that against a favorite, against sort of the great British judoka, just finds the perfect drop seoi nage. - Well, you know, his\nteam doctor and coach, he came up to me afterwards and said, \"I'm just really sorry.\" And that's all they said\nis, \"I'm just really sorry.\" They were sorry, because the obvious sadness about that, and of course, everybody takes their, I went actually two and a half, was it, three weeks later, the German Open. So he had to compete in the\nGerman Open three weeks later. So I went over to fight him and beat him in the\nfinal of the German Open. And it didn't do anything for me, because it was a much tighter match. He was a lot closer. He had a lot more confidence coming in. So he fought me a lot differently. And then it was me pulling it back and just managing to win in the final, and I thought, \"Well, that might appease.\" It appeased nothing. Didn't do anything. - When you give your\nwhole life to judo, just, and your love of winning, that's crazy how much\nthe Olympic Games mean. - It means so much. And I think, but I've got to, and I've got to say this,\nand this is honestly, if it meant that if I'd\nhave won that Olympic Games and it had to change my life\ninto a different direction, which I probably would have not competed in the '88 Olympic Games then. All right, so if it had changed my life and then I didn't have, I didn't meet my wife, and I didn't have my\nfamily that I've got now. There's no, you know, I wouldn't swap that, what I've got now, for anything. - Well, part of the demons\nthat you've gotten to know because of those losses is part of probably the central reason that made you the man you are, a legend of the sport. You could have been not that, because an Olympic gold\nis just an Olympic gold. - Yeah. And it is, isn't it? And I think that there's\na lot of Olympic Champions and World Champions that win and then are forgotten. And I said to Niki, I said to my wife, I said, \"I don't want to be forgotten,\nand I want to be remembered, so I'm going to do\nanything, anything I do, if I'm going to do\ncommentary or whatever it is, or coaching, I want to do\ncoaching to a high level, and I want to commentate at a high level.\" I remember the first\ncommentary I ever did. It was terrible. And I just thought, \"I've\ngot to do better than this.\" And I thought, I just, \"I need to do it well, and I've got to do it professionally.\" - So in the book \"A Game of Throws,\" you have a chapter titled\n\"Lessons and Losing.\" So what are some of the lessons here? What are some of the deeper lessons you've pulled out of losing? - I think great champions are made up of the people that handle\nit in the right way. And you could say, \"Well,\nI don't like losing.\" And you could throw\nyour dummy out the pram and you can be a bad loser\nin front of everybody. And actually, people pick up\non that very, very quickly. You know what it's like\nin broadcasting, right? Somebody has a bad word\nto say about somebody. - [Lex] Yep. - Yep, but actually, the ones that endear themselves to you are the ones that handle\nit in the right way, the correct way. It doesn't mean that\nyou've got to like it. I didn't like it. And I thought that I handled\nit certainly in later years, in the right way. And I like to see athletes\ndo it in the right way, and I think that's it's a\nmake or break situation. It's not all the contests they win, it's the one that they lose and then how they pick themselves up and handle themselves after. So I think that that is a big one for me. And also, I mean, I went through, obviously,\na later divorce, and that was difficult on my son, really difficult on Ashley. And then I was, and I think that some of that was the fact that I was kind of, I wasn't drinking all the time, but I was drinking in\nexcess at the wrong times. And I think that that's what\na lot of people do sometimes is that they use it for the wrong reasons, you know, and I used to hear it. I hear it now all the time, and it's that I need to knock the edge off and I need to just forget, and I need to, you know, and you need to be in a\nfuzzy place for a while, and I had a lot of time in fuzzy place, and I needed to get rid of that, you know, and I needed to clear my head. - Where was that place? Some of the lower points in your life that you've reached mentally? - I think, definitely, the fact that my marriage, first marriage, didn't work, and that was, it's a mix\nof things between us. And then, you know, so that's not where I\nwanted to be at the time, and the effects that it had on my son. And it took a long time for him then to come round and to trust me again and to have belief. He always had belief in me, but to trust me again. And then I think that that was low. And I think that when I look back, is that a lot of my bad decisions were when I was in that\nfuzzy kind of haze. And then it got progressively worse. That got progressively worse\nto the degree where it was, you know, trying to hide it, and trying to hide how much. And I was kind of a\nfunctioning kind of drunk. I think you could probably say that. And I was functioning. I was still able to, I was still training most\ndays, crazily enough. I was training to kind\nof mask it and cover it. And that was probably my savior, that I was still, you know, because I remember I said to my wife, I said to Niki, \"I'm probably the fittest. If I'm a drunk, then I'm a fittest drunk in the world.\" She said, \"Yeah, you\nprobably are actually.\" I was in great condition for a drunk. - So the fuzzy haze, where was your mind? Did you have periods of depression? - I had periods of depression. I can honestly say that my\ndepression wasn't that bad. Although I did, you know, when it's like anything\nthat gives you an up, it gives you an even\nbigger down, doesn't it? And so I hated that feeling and also hated myself\nfor letting it happen, because I have got this really, it's a bizarre, I don't know whether\nyou can call it a power, but I have the ability to\nbe able to say, \"Stop.\" And I can just, and that's what I did in the end. In the end, there was an incident when I was working for Belgium Judo, and there was an incident. It was Christmas. I can tell you exactly the day. It was 20th of December, and me and a Belgian coach, we got absolutely hammered, but we were at the wrong\nplace and it got noticed. And so I remember they pulled\nme up in front of this board and I looked down at these guys and half of them were\npeople I didn't want to be in that situation with. You know, they're not\npeople that I respected and they're not people that I trusted. So I said, \"If you're going to sack me, sack me, but I'll promise you now\nthat I will just, this is it. I'll stop. I'm just going to stop. I've decided.\" On the way back in the car, I rang Niki up, my wife, and I said, \"Whatever\nyou hear now, whatever, I'm just going to stop.\" So that was it. Stopped. - You just saw the\nmoment and said, \"Stop.\" - Stop. - So that fuzzy place, what advice could you give to people about how to overcome that, that dark place, the depression, whether it has to do with drinking or not? - I think if it's to do with drinking, all I can say is that the two days or a week into not drinking, you'll feel different. It'll make a physical difference, and you'll like that physical difference, and then from a mental\nperspective as well, because I think that you\nhave a massive downer, and I think that that must\nbe because of drugs as well, because I had a situation with my brother. He was like, he was professional wrestling, and the drugs was an element there, and so I'd never touched a drug or even seen one in my life, but I'd let the alcohol side go too far, and then decided never to do that. So then I guess I had\npeople ringing me up saying, \"How can we stop?\" So when they say, \"Can I have a word, and can I discuss something with you?\" And I know then what they\nwant to discuss with me. And the thing is that I would say, \"If you stop, then feel the effects of it, and it will make a difference\nto your everyday life, and that will make a massive difference.\" And I think about anybody\nwho is down all the time is to find the cause of\nwhat's pushing you down, you know what I mean? And try and attack that, because it's never, somebody once said to me, they said, \"Whatever you got, we've got something special.\" I mean, we have a great life and I've had a great competition record. You know, it could have been\nbetter, but it was great. But I've had success with my business and we're still out there. And we have a great life. We travel all the world, and there's people out there\nthat would live in your house at the drop of a hat, wherever you are. They'd drive your car,\nno matter what car it is, some people haven't got a car. And whatever food you're having, and you're moaning about food, somebody out there that would\ntake that and gladly eat that. All right, so there's always\nsomebody worse off than you. And I think that we tend to sometimes look at the\nthings that we haven't got rather than the things we have got. - Yeah, it's a skill, probably, just to be grateful for\nthe things you have, exactly as you said. And it's sometimes the little things like food and cars and\nall that kind of stuff, just to have gratitude for it, and family, all this kind of stuff. But it's still, having talked to a bunch\nof Olympic athletes, there is a, when you give so much\nof your life to winning and then you lose, sometimes even when you win, but when you lose at the very top, it's a tough, tough, like, tough thing to go through. - The most difficult thing, I think, for anybody, is when they have to decide when to stop. - Yeah, yeah. - You know, and all of a sudden, and I see the ones that are\ngoing second Olympic Games and then third Olympic, and the ones that are there and they're holding on and they're in their thirties now, different to when they\nwere 19 years of age. 30-something is different to 19. And then what are you\ngoing to do afterwards? And then how do you become\njust a normal person? You're never going to be\na normal person, as such. But I think you've got\nto do normal things, and then you've got, I remember the first time that\nwhen I finished competition, I had good sponsors. This was 40 years ago, but I had two really good sponsorships, vitamin company and also judogi company, and I had a car, and I had money, and I was going all over the world. I was successful. And then I stopped, and they took everything back. They took my car, and they did it within two weeks as well. They stopped my funding. And the vitamin company said, \"Thank you very much. It's been a great. We've done well by you. Bye bye.\" - This was after your last Olympics. - '88 Olympics. When that finished, and then that was it, and then it's, right, okay. First time I had to go in there and buy a tracksuit and a pair of training shoes, and wow. - Yeah, those are different sitting there in the evening by yourself. - So you go from seven days\na week or six days a week, going into the gym, and you're working out the dojo, and then you don't have to do it. And that's why you get a lot of, when they finish competition, they finish, that 30 to 40. It's still, I mean, Ilias is still doing it now. He's still in there, and\nhe's still, you know. Because he can, right? Okay, and it's natural. And I did exactly the same. And then, like I say, you just get to an age, and you just think, \"Well, I'm just going to\nkind of take a step back.\" - Which is why there's certain athletes like Ryoko Tani, never stops. Just dominates for 14 years, probably one of the\nwinningest athletes in judo. - Yeah. - Seven-time World Champ,\ntwo-time Olympic Champ, medaled at five Olympics. So it's always impressive. - Never stopped. - Never stopped. So that's an option, if\nyou're like the greatest ever. - It'd be interesting, wouldn't it, just to see what they're\ndoing now, you know? Because at some stage you\nhave to get a normal job. - Right, you do have to stop. - You do have to stop. At some stage you have to\ndecide what you're gonna do, and it's either into coaching. The judo is either to coaching, or if you're not in coaching, then it's into something\nto do with the media. And I was lucky that I, it was just by accident,\nreally, with the commentary. Somebody said, \"Would you do a voiceover?\" So I did this voiceover. And that was back in 1982. I did that. - So you've been commentating since 1982? - I did some voiceovers. I wouldn't call it commentating, but I did some voiceovers, and then I did some, we did some different\nEuropean Championships, World Championship kind of events and I did the voiceovers for it. And the way that it was done, that it was more narration. And so it kind of turned into, then somebody asked me to do an event. And when you listened to\nthe intonation of the voice and stuff like that, it wasn't like it is now. But I guess that's just\nsomething that developed, because then it was coming from the heart, and I started to get excited\nand just do my thing. And it was just me, really. Just my style. - Well, I've listened to your\ncommentary from a while back. I don't know if it's the eighties, but it's still there. - I think it's timing as well, isn't it? It's like, you know, you get your timing a bit better and know when to go in, when to come out, when to say something, when not. And I think that in the early days, I tended to think, I tended to want to talk all the time, and you don't have to do that. - Also knowing when to shut up. - That's the key, isn't it? - Yeah, part of the\ndrama is in the silence, building up to the setup and the throw and all that kind of stuff. But also you're very good at, while radiating passion, being very precise and specific about the details of\nthe throw and the setup and why something worked and didn't. - Yeah, I think there's\ntwo kinds of commentating. You can commentate what you see and then you commentate\nwhat people can't see. And so if you've got somebody that is not really understanding\nof what's happening in the inner part of the game, so it might be a technical thing or it might be the tactical part of the play here that's going on, and if you can introduce that as well, then you've got an advantage. - Quick pause. I need a bathroom break. (laughs) - Okay, good stuff. - So we just took a little\nbreak and went to JudoTV.com, which is, I guess, an IGF website. And IGF is the organization behind a lot of the big\njudo events of the world. And I just signed up. You should sign up, too. It's great. - Absolutely, sign up. Cheaper the price.\n(Lex laughing) Cheaper the price. - Yeah. And you can watch basically\nany match from the grand slams and going back through history, I guess. - Yeah, I've got to say,\nLex, I mean, everybody, still people are saying\nto me, \"Oh, you know, we need more judo on television.\" They've got judo on\ntelevision every other week that they can access all of the top people in all the top events, and it costs $100 a year. You know, it's to access everything. And they can play all the videos. I mean, we've just accessed this here, the Paris tournament, and we're going to have\na look at Teddy Riner. But it's so, it's cheap at the price. - So we're now in Paris Grand Slam 2024, Teddy Riner final. By the way, super cool. Like, you click on the draw and you can just look\nat any of the matches. You can go to the bottom of the finals. You can go. - [Neil] Yeah, to anyone. - Any one of them. That's so cool. It was really well done, really well done interface. Anyway, let me at first ask\nthe ridiculous big question. Who do you think is the\ngreatest of all time? Is Teddy Riner in the running? - He's the greatest\njudo winner of all time, of that there's no doubt, you know. I mean, he is the, and I think if you asked him whether he was the greatest judo man in the world of all time, he would say, \"No, I'm not.\" And he's not the greatest judo man. There are people with more\nbeautiful judo in some ways. Although he's got great technique. But he is the ultimate winner. - [Lex] Ten-time World Champ. - [Neil] Yeah. - Two-time gold medalist in the Olympics. I guess two-time bronze medalist. He's probably going, is he going to Paris? - Yeah. - He's going after it again. So he's right here. - He's right there. This is just a couple of months ago. And then last week, this last week, he was out again, and he won again. - Do you think he gets\ngold medal this time? - There's people getting\ncloser to him, right? Because he's obviously, age-wise, and the amount of time\nthat he's been there. He's obviously somebody that is starting not quite at his best as he was when he was younger. But, like I say, he still\nputs it on the line. He lays it on the line every single time. And then not only does\nhe lay it on the line, but he beats them all. And last week, he just beat Saito, who was a young, up-and-coming\nJapanese fighter. And he beat him in the final. It was close, and he did well. There are certain people. The smaller ones, actually,\nnot the taller ones. Because we're saying about the big arm over\nthe top that he likes. And the dominant grip that he likes. There are people that\ncan give him a hard time. Now, if at the Olympic Games, he has two or three of those on the trot, it might work against him. And it's by no means an absolute certainty that he's going to win\nthe Olympic gold medal. But he's got to be one of\nthe favorites, top favorite. No matter what happens now, Teddy Riner is the greatest winner. And if you asked the great Yamashita, he would say the same. You know, there's nobody that's, and Yamashita was unbeaten\nin international competition. And I trained with Yamashita\na lot over a two-year period and got to know him quite well. And he was one of the\ngreatest of all times. For me, he was one of\nthe greatest judo men, and I'm talking about from\na technical point of view, from a spectacular judo point of view, understanding the fundamental principles of how techniques work, sometimes having different\ntechniques that work for you. So if one doesn't work and one particular direction doesn't work, you can change the direction completely. - In case people don't know, Yamashita is this legendary\njudoka heavyweight. Teddy Riner, heavyweight,\nthat's plus 100 kg. - He would have caused\nhim all sorts of problems. - Oh, yeah, that's cool. Who do you think wins,\nYamashita versus Riner? - Yes, I think Yamashita. - Wait, whoa whoa whoa! You think Yamashita beats Teddy Riner? - I think so. - Strong words. You think so? You think so? Yamashita is on the shorter side, right? - Yeah. And he finds it more difficult with shorter people, you know? And so it was, it would have been a very\ninteresting confrontation. And I think if you asked Yamashita, he would probably say, that Teddy Riner, he's very gracious. He's really gracious. It would be really good. It would have been an\nunbelievable matchup. And I've got to say this, that Teddy Riner is the\ngreatest winner of all time. - Competition-wise. So it's interesting, both of them, maybe you can correct me, but have this osotogari, which is a kind of trip\nthat I never understood. - [Neil] Yeah. - It's a very tricky thing to do, right? It's very easy to do\nmaybe as a white belt, you roll in, you can understand, but like to do it at the\nhigh, high, high-level. - You see any of the top guys now, especially if they're second time out, so like they might catch\nsomebody by surprise. They come out and they go bang. Oh, and you go, that was amazing. But if they fought again, ten minutes later, you go, you're not going to catch\nme with that, right? You've got a different situation here. And so it's slightly different. But the best fighters adapt, (Neil snaps his fingers)\nlike that, and they're able to see a situation, feel the situation, and they attack once, and then go again and\nattack second, third time, and in the third time they make it work. - Yeah, both Yamashita and Teddy Riner, with the osotogari, they'll just like hit it\nover and over in the match. - Yeah, sometimes they'll hit\nfirst time and it won't go. And then you make a\nreadjustment of the way in. It's a little bit like, I mean, a really easy way of understanding it is if we're shooting at a target, and all of a sudden you\nstart moving that target, you know, it's different\nhitting a moving target, but it's also different\nhitting a moving target that's trying to hit you as well. And that's our game. So we're not only trying\nto throw a moving target, we're trying to throw a moving target that's trying to throw us. So it makes it even more difficult. - Yeah, there's a few folks who, you know what's coming. It's like, over and over and over, it's the same attack\nanyway with this uchi mata. It's like. It's different. It's different. There's not many people like that where it's like this, the same attack. I mean, there's other attacks also, but they'll just go after the same thing over and over and over. - When I watch great athletes, most of them can throw over both flanks, not always going left and right, although our sport always, I mean, the catters are always\ndemonstrated left and right. So, if you demonstrate, if you do something on one side, then can you demonstrate\nit on the other side? Okay, so can you do it equally? No, but you do it differently\non the other side. So, you know, when I'm teaching, I don't teach left and right. So if I was teaching\nyou to do a technique, first thing I do is say, \"I need you to take sleeve and lapel.\" All right. So I'd let you decide\nwhat was left and right. Because often what happens\nis we impart on people whether they're going to be left or right when we start teaching, you get a lot of teachers do that, and they'll say immediately, \"What do you write with, left or right hand?\" And it's no indicator, actually, as to how we do judo,\nbecause I'm left-handed and I do more predominantly right-handed, because I lead off my strongest hand. And actually, most people do. So actually, left and right\nis a bit of a trap sometimes when we're teaching. Better to get, because we can go, so my point was that a lot\nof people can go both flanks, so they'll do something over this side and something over this side. - But anyway, was one side? - He was one-sided,\nbut he could switch it. So he had a seoi nage as\nwell on the other side. So he could switch it if he had to. - Oh, interesting. And by the way, your opponent in '84, was he righty or lefty? - He was a righty. - So that drop left seoi, where did that come from? - Well, I mean, again, he could have, probably in other contests, he'd hit me with it several\ntimes and I've just stopped it, and just at the wrong place\nat the right time for him. Right place and the\nwrong time for me, right? - That's life, you know? - Yeah. - All right, let's watch some Teddy Riner. (crowd cheering) - This is final of a Paris tournament, and this is against the Korean. The Korean had had a great day, actually. - [Lex] Again, shorter. - Again, shorter. So he does find that difficult. Have a look at Teddy Riner. Teddy Riner will try and catch the sleeve. He's after the sleeve, and then the right arm over the top. That's the key point for Teddy Riner. And, of course, what he has done, if he can't always catch the big osotogari over his right-hand side, he's been doing something\nto the opposite side. - [Lex] And the Korean\njust went for a drop seoi. And Teddy Riner blocked with the hips. He's, (laughs) he's a big boy. - Like I say, he has difficulty always\nagainst somebody smaller, dropping with the seoi nages. - [Lex] Has Teddy Riner\never been thrown for ippon? Do you remember? - I've never seen him thrown for ippon, but he was thrown last\nweek for a nice technique and he's being caught more and more. - So he's getting close. - Yeah. And to say of in the final\nof the World Championships, they had a strange situation there where Tasoev was a technique down and then pulled off a counter and they didn't count it, but then they overruled it. Unfortunately, I was\ncommentating at the time, and I went for a score for Tasoev, and anyway, they overruled it, and then they awarded a\nsecond gold medal to Tasoev. - [Lex] What can you say\nabout Tamerlan Bashaev, who also gave him trouble? - Yeah, Bashaev and Tasoev are the two that could possibly go to the Olympics. So that was a close one there from Riner. That was closest that\nhe'd actually been there. - [Lex] Oh, wow. - So didn't have the sleeve, and he relies on the sleeve greatly. Big support there from\nthe French in the crowd. - And also maybe, can you explain the\npenalties for stalling? - Yeah, so if they don't attack, if they've got a grip, and they've got sleeve lapel\nor they got two hands on, if they're too passive\nand they don't attack, if they've got dominant sleeve\ngrip, they don't attack. That was quite close as\nwell from the Korean. So the Korean here, you can\nsee, is having a real go. The penalties will come\nif they don't attack at the right time. Step outside the yellow area,\nthey'll get penalized as well. - [Lex] (chuckles) That's dedication for, - Absolutely. I mean, it was really close, wasn't it? Nice little kouchi gari\nthere from the Korean. And if they touch below the beltline with the arms, so they're not allowed to grab the legs. They've stopped grabbing the legs. - [Lex] Wow, the Korean is really going. - The Korean is having\na real good go at it. - I guess every single person in that division is probably training for Teddy Riner, right? - You think, Teddy Riner\nhas been there a long time, and he's got another guy here in the final of the Paris tournament. He's got 18,000 people watching him. They're all on Teddy Riner's side. They want him to win. And the Koreans out there\non his own with his coach. - But also the pressure on Teddy Riner. - Amazing pressure. We interviewed him\nafter this, and he said, I've got pressure. People go, \"Is he going to\ndo it at the Olympic Games?\" Can I do it in Paris? He wanted to go to Paris. I mean, really, the last Olympic Games\nshould have been it. Shouldn't it be your last? Should have been the final one. But he's gone, \"No, I've got to do another four years.\" Two penalties are on the\nboard already for the Korean. That Korean is really having\na great go at Teddy Riner. - He's got a little bit of a lift on him. He's going after it. (laughs) - He's really going after it. You know, it's an amazing\neffort there from the Korean, and he's getting some\nlast minute information. I don't know if you've ever seen his coach stood next to him like\nthat, but it's amazing. He's six-foot six, and\nhe's about four-foot six. (Lex laughing) - He's a real pitch. - Full of passion, I love it. He's like screaming. - So golden score. - How does golden score work? - So the golden score. So if it goes without any\npoint on the board from a throw or a hold down or armlock strangle, then it goes into golden score. So two shidos on the board apiece. One more mistake now, and\nit's going to be all over. - And that's it. - Teddy Riner just manages\nto turn it on the Korean. And that went really against\nthe runner play, didn't it? Because the Korean did better. But Teddy Riner is a winner, and he says, \"Right, okay, let's have more cheering.\" - Finds a way to score. - And I have to say\nthat even when he loses, he's always graceful. He doesn't like it, but he's graceful. - Yeah, there is so much\nlove there in celebration. It was great, it's great to see. It's great that he's doing\nit again, going after it, chasing the gold medal again. - Well, he's chasing the gold medal. It's going to be in Paris, which is going to be even more fantastic. He's already the greatest. You said, \"What has he got\nto do to be the greatest?\" He's already the greatest\ncompetitor judo has ever known. And that was even, you know, with the great Tani. So, Tani was amazing as well. - Are you part of the commentating team? - I'm part of the commentating team, but it won't be for IJF, because it's independent broadcast. - Have you ever had an\nathlete sort of come up to you and ask, \"Why'd you say that?\" Or disagree with your commentary? - Do you know, I've got to say that 99%, 99.9% of everybody is so grateful that I've commentated their\nfights all the way through. They know if they've messed up. So if I say something,\nand I'm never disparaging, really disparaging,\nbut what I will say is, \"It was a great throw by the other guy,\" or, \"It was a great match,\" and if they made a mistake, so if they walk out, they know that I will say something that will mean something. So nobody really moans about it. I try and talk the truth if I can. - So who else would you\nconsider as some of the greats? So I personally, just because I love the\nstanding seoi-nage, Koga. So there's like, you know, the number of times you\nwon the World Championships and the Olympic Games, but there's also how you won, and how you went into fights, and what you did. It's not necessarily\nabout getting gold medals. It's about how you fought and how you represent the sport. And there's certain athletes\nlike Inoue and Iliadis that are going after the big throws. - Only after they just want\nto win by ippon, you know, and I think that is the difference is they're the ones that come out there and it's a bit like when\nTyson stepped out there, you knew what you were going to get. And if they went toe to toe, if Tyson had somebody going toe to toe, somebody was going to get knocked out. And we got the same in judo. When people go head to head\nand it's an open match, and I often talk about an open match, I say it's an open match. They're both trying to score. Somebody is going to get scored on. Somebody's going to go. And that makes it exciting. - That's great. - When they come out and they close up, then that's not an exciting match. - Is there a case for Ono? Shohei Ono, three-time World Champ, two-time gold medalist. - I think that, judo-wise, he's got to be one of the greatest because he had such versatility. He could go right and he could go left. He could pick up. He could go to the ground as well. He won a lot of his earlier\nmatches on the ground. I think his empathy and how he presents himself, sometimes he falls down. And I think that hopefully\nthat should come with tutoring and how to be a great champion after. You know, it's not just\nabout what you do on the mat, but what you do off the mat as well. - So to you, a great\nchampion is the whole package of how you present yourself when you lose, how you represent yourself,\njust even off the mat. - Yeah, I think it's how you\npresent yourself afterwards, how you are with people, how much you can help people. I mean, people, kids, and they look up to these great champions because they want to be like them. So the worst thing is\nwhen you get somebody that's a bit of an ass and they're not presenting themselves in the right way. So I like to see somebody\npresenting themselves in the right way, and I think that it's\nsomething that can be taught. It's something that normally comes with a little bit of experience, a little bit of age, you know? And I like to think that I'm\na little bit different now than I was when I was 19. Not that I was bad, I\njust think I was just, you know, I see it often now, just full of beans. (laughs) - You're a beautiful work in progress. What about Nomura? Tadahiro Nomura, that's\nthree-time gold medalist. - [Neil] Never lost an Olympic fight. - [Lex] There's something there. - Yeah, nobody ever done that. You know what I mean? So that's got to be. There has to stand. He took two years off in\nbetween every Olympic Games and came back, did the right amount of events to qualify for, not only did he having to qualify, he had to qualify through Japan. Now, Japan, remember, have\ngot the greatest depth, so they got people coming\nthrough all the time. And then he had to win\nthe Japanese Trials. I mean, we had a four-time\nWorld Champion from Japan. This is when World Championships\nwas every other year. And this is Shozo Fujii. And he was the greatest\nmiddleweight of all time, and never got to\nparticipate in the Olympics because he lost the Japanese Trials twice in two Olympic possibilities. So he had to qualify for Japan and then go to the Olympic\nGames and then do it there. So sometimes some of the best people in Japan can't get outside of Japan. Look at the situation they had with Abe and then they had Maruyama. Maruyama and Abe were\nboth the best, by far, in the under 66 kilos category. This is for the last Olympic Games. And they sent one to\nthe World Championships, one to the Olympic Games, and they both won gold medals, you know? - Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's why the\nAll-Japan Championships are legendary. There's these battles with\nYamashita and all of them. - Well, Abe and Maruyama, they had a Trials in the Kodokan. It was 26 minutes. I think it was 26 minutes it went. They were battling it out for 26 minutes. - That's great. If we can just go to, you've trained in Japan. What are those randoris like? What's that training like? - I touched on the danger, that danger of being thrown, when you get hold of somebody or somebody gets hold of you. And I often reflect, I often talk about it\nwhen I'm commentating, because I can see immediately. It's easy, isn't it? We're in the commentary chair, or if you're in the coach's chair and you don't really understand totally, absolutely what's going on when\nsomebody's being out-gripped and when they're in\ndanger of being thrown. I mean, if you're in\ndanger of being thrown, the first thing you do is stick your backside out and defend by not being in the position\nthey want you to be in. All right? And so that's danger. You feel the danger. And so in Japan, that was the place I used to go to train because I felt the danger. And so my defenses would be heightened. And so somebody that was, I went two years, one Olympic cycle, I went two years, two months without having a score on me in any competition. And then I went to one competition in the European\nChampionships, which I won, and I was struggling\nall the way through it and got scored on three times in my pool, my first pool of fights. And I was devastated, and actually nearly lost\nthe whole competition because I was more mortified about being scored on three times when I hadn't been scored\non for two and a half years. I had this thing in my head\nabout two and a half years, and then all of a sudden,\nI'm not unbeatable. And then you just, and you go. And I almost lost it, completely lost it. Just so fortunate. A couple of things went\nmy way, and just came out, and I scraped and scratched\nmy way to the final and won the final well. All right, but that was my best match, but I almost lost it. - Well, what do you do with the fact if you go to Japan and you're getting, you're saying danger, like you're probably getting, - Getting thrown. - Getting thrown in Japan. What's that do to your ego? - Well, again, it's my, that was a winning ego that had to adapt. I remember we went to the kasejo, which, police dojo, one time, and they wanted to see the, they created this groundwork competition because they wanted to see me do the juji. How I went in and how I.\n- [Lex] Armbar. - Yeah, the armbar. They wanted to see how I did it from underneath or over the top. So they created this event. - Study the creature. - Yeah, they started it, so. And then winner stays on. Competition was happening at the kasejo. So I did about seven, I think, seven in, and then my coach came in and said, \"No, it's finished. That's it now, it's finished.\" You know, suddenly we\nrealized what was going on, and I was going, \"No, no, no, don't stop it.\" (Lex laughing) Like that, you know. And it was one of those moments where the boot was on\nmy foot, you could say, rather than the other side, the other way, because I had been to Japan in situations. I remember as a 16-year-old, I got such a drumming from one of the Japanese guys, older students, and he had a gold tooth, and so he was Goldtooth to me, and he was my nightmare. And I remember I kept\ncoming out to fight him because he kept throwing me, and I was crying and I was upset, and I was like, and then that was another occasion where I got dragged\naway, and I said, \"No.\" So I wanted to go back and fight him. And I went back to the same\ndojo every year to fight him. He was on my mind. Morning, noon, night, he was on my mind. - [Lex] Goldtooth was on your mind. - Goldtooth was on my mind, you know? - Did you ever get him? - Two years later, I was. Two years to me, from 16 to\n18 was totally different. 18 years of age, I was pretty competitive with him, and it was like I was\nstanding up with him. 19, he was in the groundwork competition. - Mm-hmm. And that's when the switch happened. - Switch happened, you\nknow, because I just, well, because I remember\ngetting the armlock, and didn't put it on immediately. I needed it to last. It had to last. - Sure. - So I spread, the whole thing lasted as long\nas I could possibly get it. And it was a long memory as I was looking down at him. - And now he has nightmares about you. I wonder what nickname he has for you. - I don't know. I'm hoping that he remembers me. He has a photo of you. He probably doesn't say, he doesn't back an eyelid. Doesn't say a thing about it. - Well, I mean, can you just speak to that\ntraining with those folks, you know, you said crying, just the frustration of being thrown. - [Neil] Yeah. - I mean, what, how do you? It's such a beautiful part of\nthe process of becoming great. - Yeah, I think it is just something that doesn't happen at this level. You know, we were talking about levels, and then at this level, it never happened. And then I went out in\nmy first European Cadet, and all of a sudden I wasn't the top guy. I was in the mix, and then I had to work myself\nto the top of that mix, and then to the top of the next one, because I went to the\nEuropean Senior Championships, and again, you're not the top. And you work your way to the top of that. And I think it is a frustration, but I think it's that\nkind of hatred of losing and also, being out of control. I think that the first time, first Senior European\nChampionships I fought, I had fought Nevzorov, but he\nwas only one in my contest. Then I had to fight a\nFrenchman for third place, but he totally outgripped me. And I remember I was more upset, though I won the contest, I was more upset that he totally, he did outgrip me, and I was more upset. And then I fought him a year later, and I outgripped him. All right, so it was one of those, it was a learning process\nall the way through. - Yeah, that frustration is like, whatever that does to your soul, the building up afterwards is what actually makes you better. It's fascinating. And you think there's, in Japan, just killers there that are\nthe world doesn't know about? - Yeah, there's World\nChampions in the dojo. There's people that never make it out. I remember we were training like so, and everybody that goes to Japan, all my friends that have\nbeen World Olympic Champions, they all know what I'm talking about. They know exactly who I'm what I'm saying is that when\nwe go to the dojos there, we all get thrown by people that never come\nout to be World Champions. They're just in the mix while they're going through\nthree years of university. And then they go, we had a guy, (Lex laughing) we had a guy that came in, he was business guy, came in with his suitcase\nin his briefcase like that. He's got his tie up like that. So he decides he's going to come in, and he gets changed, and he's in his lunch hour. He's in his lunch hour, right? So got to be quick. (Lex laughing) So he comes in and he goes through, he's working his way through\nthe whole of the British team. We're all lined up, right? So he's just working his\nway through the whole of the British team. And I knew it was my turn next. - On his lunch hour. - So I get hold of him, and\nI throw him immediately. And then it was what we were talking about when it happens in the first\nfew seconds of the practice. So then I had four minutes\nof him coming at me, and I'm going up into the air, and I'm twisting off, and I'm like. And then everybody's laughing\nat the side of the mat, or the whole British team. He's gone through the whole British team. And then he, ten minutes later, he's tied his tie up like that, you know, and oh, back to work, like that. Imagine him sitting behind\nhis desk and his computer. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I'm glad he didn't get out. (Lex and Neil laughing) - Hopefully, he listens to this. - Hopefully. - Anybody else I didn't mention as part of the greats that\njust kind of jump to your mind? - Kashiwazaki Sensei is my\nfavorite of all favorites. He is what I would call a judo genius. I don't know if you can get him up here. Can we get him up? - Yeah. - So go into 1981 World Championships, and I'll talk you through\nthe great Kashiwazaki. He was one year in Great Britain, and he was a guy that\nwas so much a genius. All right, so you want the\nfinal of the under 65 kg there, the one at the top. This is him. He is two weight categories\nbelow my weight category that I won the World\nChampionships, same year I won it. So this is, it's not, I'm not sure if this is\ngoing to show his final. - [Lex] This is a highlight. - Oh, watch this. This he did in the final.\n- What! - In the final of the World.\n- For people just listening, he did an incredible sacrifice throw. - Yep, and then he was\non top for the newaza and renowned for his groundwork, and he was on top of against\na really strong Romanian guy. All right, so his transition\nwas just phenomenal. - Yeah, let me go back and look at that, what just happened. - So he's just showing you. So he does this koji thing\njust to create space. - Oh, wow. - And it's his follow\nthrough into groundwork that is best of all. And then the Romanian, really strong, like I say, he'd gone all the way through to the final of the World Championships, winning most by ippon,\nI think, the Romanian, and he's defending\nreally, really well here. And you can see that,\nhow persistent he is. He knows exactly what he wants. He's just got to get his leg out. Now watch, he'll tie the arm up, and then he'll pull the\ntop leg towards him, and then he'll push the bottom one off. - Always working. - With both feet. Always working, always working. Readjust the balance. Still one leg trapped. Final of the World Championships. Good referee, because he's\nrefereeing something here that's happening that's going\nto decide as to whether, so he doesn't call it\nto stand it up at all. Watch him pull the top one now, and he will push the bottom one. - There's a calmness on his face. It's great to see. - Calm, calm. Pushes the bottom leg out. Job done. All finished. This is him again. Watch this. This is another technique that he does. - [Lex] The sacrifice. - And then just again,\nsacrifice directly in, directly into the newaza. - Transition is everything, isn't it? In judo. - Yeah, well, in anything, really, but judo it especially pays off. - Yeah. I mean, because we haven't got that long. I mean, we had more time here. They've just brought more time back. So we've got more time to transition in and to get the situation that we want and to get the attacking\nsituation that we want, because I remember I\nwas teaching in America to some jiu-jitsu guys, and they were saying, \"Oh, we'll never give you our back.\" And I said, with judo rules, certain situations, it happens that when we try and do throws where we're facing away from our opponent, so for example seoi nages, if they fail, then the back is there, and that's how we get the back. And it's a different situation than going on your back\nin the guard situation, totally different. - Well, there Travis Stevens, I don't know how familiar with his judo, but he's a really interesting example because he competed at the highest level in jiu-jitsu as well. And his idea, he's a big seoi-nage guy, and he basically threw all of that away. - [Neil] In the jiu-jitsu? - In the jiu-jitsu. Like, he took the sport\nfrom scratch for what it is. So he almost never did\na standing seoi nage or seoi nages at all in in jiu-jitsu. - No, because it would\nleave his back all the time, if it failed, you know what I mean? But he wouldn't have the same\nkind of grip on the judogi or the the jiu-jitsu gi. A little bit different. - And so you have to kind\nof consider the sport, the art of it, and also the competitors, the styles, and the culture of the sport if you want to win. If winning is the most important thing, then like, all right, well, let's. - But you learn the game, don't you? And that's what he did. He learned the game, and I think that is credit to him, and that's why I say about wrestling. The wrestlers, I mean, good to learn the judo and for what it is and the mechanics and how it works, and then learn the wrestling. I mean, I do the commentary\nas well for the freestyle, and I will be at the\nOlympics for the freestyle and the Greco-Roman, so. And I love the freestyle. Absolutely love it. But freestyle is freestyle. Judo is judo. I like to see people doing judo. - Yeah. But there's a rhyme to\nthe whole combat thing. They're all, I mean, the body mechanics, it's all like fascinating\nechoes of each other in interesting ways. The details are different, but they're still two humans clashing. - Yeah, we've got some\namazing crossovers with people like the Mongolians have\ncome in, the Georgians. I mean, the Georgians do massive pickups and different techniques. And, you know, if you ask the fighters whether grabbing the legs, a lot of them would say some\nof the wrestling styles, the Georgians and the\nMongolians might say, \"Yeah, I'd like to be\nable to take the legs,\" but a lot of them just adapted. You get Iliadis for\nexample, he just adapted. So he thought, \"Well, I'll\ntake my arm over the top and I'll just rip him\nout the floor that way.\" You know what I mean? - They're still doing the big lifts, they're still doing the big gripping, but they just don't grab below the legs. - [Neil] Yeah. - It's weird. They figured it out. (laughs) - And they figured it out like that. - Yeah, you would think\nit'd take a long time. No, it was like a month. (laughs) - Yeah, no, exactly. - The highest level, which is crazy. So you mentioned jiu-jitsu a little bit. What to you is an interesting difference between jiu-jitsu and\njudo that you've observed? Because you're one of the greatest ever on the ground in judo. And so jiu-jitsu is primarily focused on similar type of stuff on the ground. So what to you is an\ninteresting difference there? - They're a different approach, different time scale to them, and they have a different way in. So, like where ours comes from a standing position directly in, we've got a time scale on it. So we have to, like the catch. I always talk about the catch, because in judo terms, if you don't get the catch immediately, then the referee won't\nsee the transition in and also the continuation\nfrom plan A, B, C, D, if something builds. So we have to build it, and we have to build it quickly. And I think in jiu-jitsu terms, you have more time to build. - Yeah, there's a, there's\na kind of patience, like, oh, if this doesn't work out, I could try a different thing. Just with judo, there's like an urgency. - [Neil] There's an urgency. - And there's a ref watching skeptically. So you better show that\nyou're making progress. - You've got to show the progression. And that's why, you know, I\nalways had a plan A, B, C. You see there with, that was 1981 there. The Great Kashiwazaki had a progression. You know, everything was, he knew exactly where he had to be. It was feel. That wasn't by accident. It was trained. And I think that that transition there and taking control of somebody's mistake, so somebody might have made a mistake or not hit properly or your defense has caused\nthem to make a mistake, and then you take advantage of it, and that is the difference. - So one of the side effects of that, I don't know with the chicken or the egg, but judo people on the ground\nare much more aggressive. So probably because of the urgency, but just like there's an intention behind the progress you're making. I think jiu-jitsu is more relaxed. There's more a culture of\njust finding places to relax and think of different control and positions and take your time. And as a result, it's\nmuch, much less exhausting. So you can go for much longer. It feels like judo is exhausting. - It's that ten second blast, isn't it? It's like doing sprints all the time, and that is really hard and that's a special kind\nof condition you need, and you need to be able to catch it and know when to go and when not to go. And I think also, I was going to ask you, you think it'd make a difference? I mean, certain jiu-jitsu, you can't just throw yourself\non your back into the guard. You have to throw into the situation. So you have got, I mean, I know Roger Gracie, he decided that he was\ngoing to learn judo. He saw the importance\nof being able to throw for the transition in, and so he came to the Budokwai, and he was learning off Ray Stevens, and they were doing really a lot. - Yeah, well, he's a fascinating study because he does the most basic stuff. - But does it well. - Like, what another level of well. It's like Yamashita. Everyone knows what's\ncoming with Roger Gracie, but he just does it anyway against the best people in the world. It's crazy. He's like, everybody in jiu-jitsu at white belt learns the\ntechniques he's using, and he just does it. - Amazing, isn't it? But he has about a thousand ways in. - Yeah, yeah. I mean, and in the thousand ways, there's in the details, so it kind of might even\nlook the same to people, but there's, I mean he\nfinds a way to choke people, so he's on top of them, mounted in a sort of judo pin position. And everyone knows what's coming next against the best people in the world, and you should be able to\ndefend it, but nobody can. It's crazy. - I think there's the\npower element as well. You know, that you don't realize how, when somebody's directed\nin a particular way, then you have that kind of\nelement of absolute power. You can only feel, like when Roger's doing a technique, I think that you would only\nfeel it if he did it on you. You know, then then you can feel it. It's not something that happens, so tricks is one thing, but actually being able to\ndo something really well from a power point of view, it's like you say, he only does those few things, but he does them really,\nreally, really well. - Yeah, I don't know what\nthat is about, actually, judo pins is a very\ninteresting case study as well, because people are able to feel so heavy. One of the things judoka are able to do is pin extremely well, and it makes you realize that\nit's not about the weight. It's about some kind of technique that makes people feel like\nthey weigh 1,000 pounds. - It's about weight distribution\nand change of balance. A lot of people don't realize\nthat there's huge changes of balance on the ground, massive. You know what it's like. I mean, you're a jiu-jitsu man, and the detail of the techniques is what really interests me. I mean, I'm always looking\nsmall ideas, you know, I'm always looking at the jiu-jitsu, and it fascinates me. I would have done jiu-jitsu for sure, but I wouldn't have\nforgotten the judo way in to the techniques, you know what I mean? I think that you've got\nto differentiate the two, but I would have loved the jiu-jitsu. I would have absolutely loved it, but it wasn't as prominent then. Where the newaza came from, it came from a mistake, me getting beaten in a particular contest. And I went, I'm not going to\nbe beaten again on the ground. (Lex laughing) That's how it happened. - Yeah, well, yeah, the story of your life is like a loss creates the\nphoenix rises from the ashes. - Well, it was 1978, and it wasn't a mistake. It was a particular movement, and I was fighting weight\nup from my normal weight. But I stayed in the same position for one second too long, got caught and, - Choked. - Sankaku, yeah, triangle, triangle. - Triangle, wow. - And I said, I literally just the same as\nI said to you when I said, \"I'm not going to drink anymore.\" I came off and I said, \"I'm never going to get\ncaught on the ground again.\" - [Lex] Yeah, never going\nto lose on the ground. - And I never lost in my whole\ncompetitive career again. - Wow. But yeah, I should mention that\nthere is nothing like a pin from a judo person. And I don't actually know if people in jiu-jitsu\nhave made sense of that, like loaded that in. - But it's not part of, it's not part of the game, is it? You know, the pin, it's submission. - Yeah, but, you know, control is part of the game. - [Neil] Right. - And nobody controls a human body the way judo people do on the ground. Like they have understood\nthe science of control. And I think that control\nis extremely useful in jiu-jitsu as well. It's just that people don't, because there's so many\nother domains of exploration. - [Neil] It's interesting. - I mean, just, and especially when you apply jiu-jitsu to the fighting setting. So mixed martial arts, that control, that side control, that pin control is really,\nreally really important. But then you add punching to\nthe thing, and it becomes. - Yeah, puts a whole different\nthing on it, doesn't it? - I mean, there's an alternate history where you would have been\npart of the early UFCs if time was a little different. Maybe a few years later, because your style of judo and jiu-jitsu and the transitions and the aggression, all of that would have worked\nreally well in the early UFCs. - I'm sure I was being set up at one stage by one of the Gracies, and that was when he was\nwinning all the matches. But he came with a couple of the cousins to one of my seminars. - Nice. (laughs) - He was one of the first ones, wasn't he? That's how I love to see the kind of UFC, because it was different\nmartial arts, different skills, and I mean he'd get close, and he'd just choke them out or armlock them or armbar them. And that was brilliant. For me, that was a revelation. That was how I saw it. - It's a fascinating science experiment. Which aspects of different\nmartial arts work well and not when they clashed together? And it did turn out\nthat newaza worked well. - It was the key, wasn't it? - Yeah, it was a big missing link in our conception of fighting. It's the neutralizer of size. - Yeah. - And a lot of other components, and it just blew people's mind. Like, okay, it's not just about size. It's not just about big\nguys swinging hands. It's a lot of other components. And the groundwork is\nreally, really important. And, of course, there's a few judoka that\nsucceeded in the UFC since then, which is always\ninteresting, how they adapt. When you take off the gi, how can you still throw people? How can you still do control? How can you still take advantage of the transition on the ground? Ronda Rousey is a good example of somebody that took advantage of that. - Yeah, I think one of the biggest things for the judoka is we've never, you know, there's no strikes. And I think that's the biggest shock, if you wish, when you get. - Punched in the face. - When you get punched in the face and you're not used to that. That's not what we're used to. - Some people are able to get punched in the face better than others. Yeah, for sure. Then again, there's Ronda Rousey, who doesn't need to get\npunched in the face. She just gets in close, throws a person, armbar right there. - And Kayla, you know, Kayla as well. - Kayla Harrison, that's\nanother incredible person. She could have probably been\njust winning Olympic gold medal after Olympic gold medal, but chose to. - Whatever she decides. I mean, Ronda as well, you know, whatever they decided to do, they're great athletes. They hate losing. (Lex laughing) I don't know anybody that hates\nlosing more than those two. They don't like it. - And Kayla Harrison, I don't know anybody that\nworks as hard as her. That's a crazy, crazy, crazy work ethic. Well, let me ask you about training. Again, Jimmy Pedro said\nhe learned a lot from you. He learned how to do a tai otoshi, and the armbar juji gatame. But he also learned from\nyou training methodology. So, what's he talking about? He told me about this. What's your approach to training throughout your career\nand as it developed? - I always wanted to train\nharder than anybody else. I still train now every day. If I don't train, do something, I do do an hour of my physical work, and I still go on the mat a little bit. I'm 65 now, so I'm not doing\nreally heavy stuff on the mat, but I still like to train. And when I was 21, 20, up to 30, I was one of the best trainers. But Jimmy Pedro was one of\nthe best trainers as well. He was one of the, he's one of your dream athletes. When Jimmy Pedro stepped\nthrough your door, and he was just a kid. He was just young when he\nstepped through my door. And I had a lot of full-time trainers, so I had up to 20 really good athletes that were training hard, and I only wanted hard trainers. Give me ten that trained hard rather than your one prima donna, that you're skillful, the one that could do it. I just, I wanted 10 or\n20 really hard trainers because you can do so much with them. You can make champions. You can make them World Champions. You know, if you got somebody\nthat was a special talent and they wanted to work hard, then you had a special athlete. - Well, when you say hard\ntrainers, what do you mean? Are these people that just, like, every single day are able\nto just grind it out? Do randori, do the training,\ndo the boring things, just keep coming back? - Yeah, when they're going gets tough. And I think that that was him. He had a special mentality, and the thing is, you see, when you've got him in\nyour dojo, all right, even when you're tired, when somebody's tired, what an example to the others, so he'd pull the other\nones in as well, you know. So I had somebody that\nwhen everybody was tired and everybody was sick of it and everybody just wanted to rest, and he'd still be there. So they had to do it. So that was for me, a win-win. So I had all the Americans, actually, I had Bobby Berland,\nand I had Michael Swain, and I had Ed Liddie, and I had them all coming to\nvisit me at different times. Jimmy was there. You know, they wanted to be the best. In the end, we had such\na great club atmosphere, they wanted to come for the hard work, and they knew that if they came, they were going to be dragged out and we were going to do physical training, and it was physical training\nlike they hadn't done before. But it wasn't just the physical training, it was the judo and the\nskill side of it as well. And so I always had a great empathy with the US team, Olympic team. So a lot of your Olympic medalists have been through with me, and so I'm proud of that, because we had some great times, and they're still great mates now. And so in New York, in\na couple of weeks' time, I'm going to have everybody\nwho's going to be there. They're all coming in.\n(Lex laughing) - All old friends. - All old friends. - And new friends. So what's a tough week\nlook like at your peak? Physical training, randori? Is there days off? Are you training like twice a day? - Twice a day. So we do the preparation training, we do the running, we do the weight training, we do the skills in the morning as well. The skills is for me, one of the biggest advantages that any full-time trainers can have because what happens is\nthat with most clubs, you're trying to fit\neverything into that hour and a half or two hours. You fit your skills, you fit your physical\ntraining and your sparring, and everything's in there all grouped in. So the biggest advantages\nof having a full-time group is that you can split your skills, and your skills lay your foundation. So the biggest advantage is being able to work specifically on things without having to worry about\ngetting to do your free, your randori or your sparring, or then you got to go out for\na run, you just do the skills. - When you talk about skills, say your specialty is a tai otoshi, are we talking about uchikomi,\ndoing a bunch of fists, the working with bands, are you doing throws? Are you actually just having conversations about specific tiny details of throws? What does skills mean? - All those things about doing\nyour repetition practice, making sure the repetition is correct. You know, there's good repetition. - So when we say good repetition, is it uchikomi, when you're just fitting the\nthrow versus doing the throw, where do you land on the value of both? - I'm getting it moving. So one of the biggest, most important things\nis getting it moving. If we do something static, again it's that static target. You need to get it moving. So you need to do a repetition. And also you need to do\nit correct repetition, because if you're doing\na hundred repetitions that are not correct, and repetitions under pressure, too much pressure, without somebody overseeing those skills to make sure that you correct the skills, because if you're doing a skill, if you're doing it 99 times\nincorrectly, all right, then repetition doesn't make perfect. Repetition makes permanent. So you've got to make it as\nperfect as you possibly can. So, actually, that skills group there is the most important thing, and what I used to do is oversee it. So I'd oversee it to make sure\nthat it was done properly. - So you're watching the footwork, you're watching the gripping, and then just constantly adjusting. - I'll give you an example, Jimmy Pedro. Jimmy was one of the hardest. When he was 19 years of age, right? So he was always asking\nme to practice, always. So he's always on me all the time. So I do groundwork with him, and could I put him on his back? No, I was all on him, and he'll tell you, but he was just, wouldn't go. He was just. He was going to be great, without a doubt. All right? So I wanted everybody\non with him, everybody. So everybody went on with him, you know, and so they only improved their game, and it improved him. And then with small technical things that have stayed with\nhim that we were doing with the juji gatame that\nwas passed on to Kayla and then gone on to Rhonda, and it's all small things\nthat I can see sometimes that it's passed on. - What about the tai otoshi? He said he learned a\nlot from you, from that. - [Neil] And he does it differently. - And so I should mention that's\none of the trickier throw. I mean, I still don't\nunderstand it. (laughs) - It is a tricky throw. - I don't understand. So, for people who don't know, it, boy, how would you even explain it? It doesn't make any sense. When you just look solo, the movement you make is quite simple, but how you get person to be off balance, how you actually get them to be thrown, and when you do throw it successfully, it looks like a whipping\nmotion that's effortless. It makes no sense. - It makes no sense, (Lex laughing) other than it's every technique\nstarts with the hands, so it's what we call kuzushi. And you're pulling somebody off balance, getting them moving, pulling them off balance. Tai otoshi means body drop. So it's basically two legs\nacross your partner's body. I've got my back to you, all right? And I've already pulled you\noff balance with my hands. And then I'm going to just flex my legs up just as you're coming onto my back, and then you're going to go over if I coordinate it all right. If it doesn't get coordinated right, then you're going to come right on my back and try to rip my arm off, you know? So, yeah, gotta get it right. - What was, if you can\nconvert it into words, some secret ingredients that allowed you to pull it\noff at the highest levels, the tai otoshi? - The hands start every technique. So getting the repetition\nright, first of all. So to get the repetition\nright, you need a good partner. So actually training your partner to react in the right way is just as important\nas learning the throw. So actually, what happens is, we could get a lesson of beginners. We teach the throw, and then go, \"Right, off you go.\" And 90% of them will get it wrong because their partner's not\nreacting in the right way. So half of it is to get the\nperson to react as they should. So if I was doing it with you, you and I, first thing I'd teach you to do is to react the way I want you to react, and then I'd react the way\nthat you want me to react. So then we'd have success with it, rather than you leaning\nback in the wrong way or resisting or frightened\nyou're going over. So, actually, that's why\nnine times out of ten, people get the technique wrong. - It's actually fascinating to me because in the United States, where I came up, judo, I mean, the level of judo is not comparable to the level of judo in\nthe rest of the world. Of course, the Pedro Center\nis an exception to that. - [Neil] Certain athletes, yeah. - Certain athletes. When I trained recently with Jimmy Pedro, it's like even the 16-year-old-kids\nare just all deadly. So it was terrifying. But I remember the Russian National Team came through Philadelphia. And one of the things\nthat really impressed me is just how much easier judo was, training judo with them. They moved correctly as uke, as the people getting thrown. Every aspect of their\nbody movement was correct in terms of it felt right\nto be throwing them, to be training with them. Everything about the gripping, about the position of their hips, about the shoulder, everything. It was fun, it was easy. And I always felt like I was learning. So I think all of that\nis loaded in, I guess, into proper training. So you're developing through the throws. You're developing the right technique. - Yeah, you have to develop between, I always had training\npartners that I trained with up to each Olympic Games, and we worked together for the, we did the skills together, and then we worked together in order to make techniques work, and we got it moving\nas quickly as we could. And one of the worst things that I see is, and I see a lot of YouTube\nstuff with coaches. - Here we go. - Don't even start me on that. Don't even start me on that. But, you know. (Lex laughing) - What? - You're laughing because you know what\nI'm talking about, right? - Yeah, no I'm actually laughing because I'm enjoying you talking trash. (Lex and Neil laughing) But talk about technique. - Yeah, just, well, the coaches and the\nclipboard guys, you know, with the clipboards and the stopwatches, and they got these kids\nrunning up and down the mat and then doing Uchikomi of something that technically\nincorrect ten times, and then running up and doing\nanother ten at the other side, and actually mixing everything together, and it's just a mess. - [Lex] Yeah, technique is important. - Just technical mess. - That said, some of it\nis conditioning-type stuff that you were doing. So what is like the hardest type of physical conditioning you were doing? - Probably ran too much. You know, when I was a kid, if I could go back now,\nI wouldn't run as much. And I ran hard and I ran strong. And I remember doing\nLondon Marathon one time, and I said, \"I'm never\ngoing to do it again.\" I never. But I ran, you know, and I was trying to, the problem was when I\ndid the London Marathon is I was trying to beat three hours. - It's that desire to win.\n- It's totally insane. You know, it was insane. And I went out through half marathon in what I thought was a good time. Anyway, I got to 16, 17\nmiles and totally blew. - So you went out too fast.\n- Yeah, I went out too fast. - And then you just wanted to keep going. - I died, absolutely. I died, Lex.\n(Lex laughing) I got in. I crossed the line. I remember seeing this\nbridge over there, right? And the bridge, it was the finishing line over the bridge. And I had to get over. It was the longest bridge\nI've ever, ever walked over. Like walk, run. So I got over the bridge, and I took one step\nover the line like that. And there was a guy over there, and he was trying to rush\neverybody through, you know, and he was going, \"Come\non, come on, come on. There's people behind you.\" Get your hands off me. (Lex laughing) I said, \"Get your hands off me now.\" Like that, because\nwe're going to fall out, and I couldn't move. I couldn't move. I was white. - And it's amazing that you made it to the finish line, though. - I did. I got over there, and yeah, Donald Duck\npassing me was a tell. - Oh, there was a person\ndressed as Donald Duck? - Donald Duck, yeah. But the thing was, I\nstill crossed over 3:38. I crossed over 3:38, but I lost 38 minutes\nin the last four miles. - To that bridge. Longest bridge ever. So you regret the run. - So anyway, I would do the running a little bit differently, but we ran, we ran hard, we did the weight training, we did good weight training. It was all conditioned. So, I mean, it was never the\nsame training all the time. So it was always, we'd have certain phases building up. It was scientifically done. It wasn't just out there\nrun, weight training, judo, same judo all the time. It was always pretty scientific. - Good variety. - It was a good variety. And it had build up, and it had a speed phase,\nand it had a power phase, and it had like a base condition. - What about the randori? Was there a method to the madness there? - [Neil] Yeah.\n- How much randori did you do? - A lot. So the most important\nthing for me, I mean, I see now that there's a lot of people out there that are\nnot getting enough randori. They're not randori-ing enough. And there's a lot of\nsports science people, and they're running and\nthey're weight training, and they're doing it all to death, and there's not enough judo. And the only ones, like you have a look at some of the Eastern Bloc countries that are getting together, they're having these mass camps, and the Japanese, they have just massive people\nthat they can do there. They're doing probably\n50, 60 randoris a week. - Wait, what? - 50 or 60 a week? - Wow. - The average person is getting together. I mean, when I was doing randoris, when I went to Japan, it was just purely for 60 randoris a week. - How much is each one, how long is it? - So they were five minutes then. They're four minutes now. - But that's a lot, especially given the level\nof the competition there. - Well, you can do it in Japan,\nbecause it's fairly light. If they throw you, they throw you. You throw them. - There's like a level of, like you're moving at close to 100%. But the actual power and the\nforce is not quite there. - Different in Korea. Korea was harder. It was more physical. So you couldn't do 50 randoris in Korea. You'd die. Yeah. So you do 30. - 50 to 60 randori, wow. - But you need the randori. And so I chase the randoris. So I chased them into training camps. I chased them all over my country. So I was getting 40 to\n50 a week in my club, and then I would go to\ntraining camps and add more. And I honestly don't think\nthat they do enough now, a lot of countries. - Somebody who doesn't know,\nrandori is live training. - Yeah, sparring. - Was there a few people you remember that were just really tough to go against? You mentioned Goldtooth. Is there others like him? - Goldtooth was pretty horrific. - [Lex] Yeah. (Lex and Neil laughing) - He was. - [Lex] Well, you got him in the end. - He did pretty all right. I got him in the end. And, yeah. (Lex laughing) - Is there, I suppose I should say not just tough, but just good training\npartners that you liked? - Great training partners. I remember Nishida. And Nishida was, I mentioned him earlier,\nsaid he was one of the best. I mean, he was just\nsuch a great technician. So I would go there to his dojo, and he'd ask me to practice, and he'd finish the practice, and you know that he would\nalways say, \"Another one. We'll do another one.\" So you'd go, \"Ah, yeah,\" because you had to make out that you weren't that bothered that you had to do another one. So you do another one back to back, and then he goes, sometimes, \"Let's do another one.\" So he'd end up doing 15\nminutes with the same guy who could possibly throw you at any time. And that was hard, so. But I remember those particular guys, and there were plenty of those. - What do you do with the exhaustion that\nyou're feeling in those? Like, how deep did you go, in terms of? - You have to dig deep. And I think that that was the great thing about having certain, like European training\ncamps were more physical. So I remember that we would\nhave European training camps where you'd fight Germans, and then the Dutch, and then the French, and then the Russian, or the. You'd have all sorts different styles and people there to fight. And that was something. Then you'd have to dig\nin at a different place, come out of there. - Where do you go mentally? How many times have you gone there where you're really in deep waters, exhaustion-wise, in competition actually? - Competition, it's happened. So sometimes you go past where your forearms are absolutely blown. I remember the final of a\nCzech tournament that we had, and I fought a Frenchman in the final, and my forearms were so blown I couldn't shake his hand, you know? And then I remember they\nwere solid, absolutely solid, and they had lactic acid in them. And I remember I stood on the rostrum and they were giving me things, and I couldn't grip them properly. So I was saying, \"Put it under my armpit.\" Or, you know, chin like that, trying to hold it.\n(Lex laughing) I couldn't hold anything, you know? And so there are times when I\nreally had to go really deep. I remember fighting two East Germans the same day one of the competitions, and the number one and the\nnumber two East Germans, and that was another day where\nI had to really dig deep. - That's the, the fascinating thing about some of these tournaments is if you go full distance\non several matches in a row, the way you're seeing in the finals are two people that have\nfought a lot that day. - Yeah. And we have golden score now, so we see a lot of guys that\ngoing into golden score, and they've done one\ncontest of four minutes, and then they go another four minutes, and then we've had some go\ninto a third four minutes. This is all back to back. It might be in the first round. It might be in the final. And we've got some now that are coming out and you can see the stats and the ones that win in golden score. So we got Japanese, Hashimoto. He's the Japanese representative now, instead of Ono, because Ono's finished. So Hashimoto's coming out. He was in a tournament last week. - Is there anything to look up? - Yeah, just have a look at him. So Hashimoto's in white here. All right. And, there's a great example there. (Lex laughing) Well, I'm glad we got onto that, so, I mean, he has got\ngreat technique, Hashimoto. - Effortless, effortless. - There's the tai otoshi. So you can see exactly\nwhat we're talking about, that great timing. And again, sometimes he\nbacks them up to the edge, and then he'll wait for them\nto come back in towards. They don't want to step\nout to get a penalty. - I guess that's a cross grip tai otoshi or did I see that wrong? - Yeah, cross grip, different grips, great examples there. Just what we were talking about. (Lex and Neil laughing)\n- They make it look so easy. Wow. - So he's going to be their\nrepresentative at 73 kg. Look at him back him up again, and again, just catching him as he pushes back. - So push, push, push, and then. - Yep, action-reaction at his best there. And that slight change of direction, he sometimes goes down\nonto his knee there, which is seoi otoshi. It turns from tai otoshi,\nwhich is springing up, to seoi otoshi, which is going down. - Oh, the title of the video is, \"His Tai Otoshi is a Work of Art.\" - Yeah, this is him at his best, showing him doing what he does best. But he had to go three times\ninto golden score last week and dig deep and lost one of them, I think. - But you're still going at it. You talk about all\nthose training sessions. Niki, your wonderful wife, told me that you were looking, you were going all over\nlike from Target to Target looking for workout clothes, because your luggage got lost because you had to get a workout in. - Yeah, you know what, I just, I realize that if I'm\na miserable git, right, then she'll get me to get me into the gym. And the thing is that I'm better if I get in there for an hour and I just do something. At least 30, 35 to 40 minutes cardio, and then I do some weights\nand more high repetitions. It's not so much heavyweights now, but more functional. - I mean you travel all over the world for the commentary of these competitions, so is it sometimes a challenge to figure out how? - Well, during Covid, then they closed all the gyms but we were still going out. We were one of the first ones out. The judo were some of the first out. The competitions were behind closed doors. So we were in the hotel, the gym was closed, so we couldn't use the gyms. So we had to look for other\nways that we could work out. So most of the hotels that we were in were high-rise hotels. So we were in the steps. We were doing the steps\nright the way up, you know? So I started it. And so I started off with me going up, and then one or two of the others, and the referees started to go up with me. So in the end we'd have this trail of people going up the steps and down, and every place we went\nto we had the steps. So yeah, that was an\ninteresting situation. So we were sick of steps in the end. - What advice would you give to beginners, people starting out in judo, how to develop their game, how to find the beauty in the\nsport and the art of judo? - If you put ten people\nin a room and said, \"Right, get on with it,\" you'd have mayhem, right? And I think that whatever\nsport you're doing, you need good instruction, good teaching, and a good club atmosphere, somewhere that's not so intense that winning is the only thing. And I think that if you look at 90% of the people that practice martial arts are doing it for pleasure, so they want to get pleasure. So you need a club that's\ngot a bit of a mixture. You know, they've got a direction to go into competition if they want, and then the rest, it's for fun and to enjoy it, but with really good instruction, because with really good instruction and a good foundation and a good base, you get more enjoyment\nbecause you have more success. And let's be honest, you know, the more success we have with something, the more we like it. - Yeah, and great technique is a way to really discover the beauty of the art. And so great teaching is\nreally important there. - Great teaching is so important. - What about, what does it take to get from the early days when you start judo to world-class level? - I think that with most, I mean, you do hear, don't you, if somebody's been doing\njudo for eight years and then they're in, and I think it happened, one of the French, Tcheumeo, she went to the Olympic Games in 2012, and she'd been doing judo for eight years, but then she started to lose, you know, so she had a relative success early on. The Olympics was one of them. She got a silver medal, but then she went off the boil and then she came back. And now she's been there for, she's still competing, and she's been there for well\nover 13 years at the very top. So I think that any foundation, it's like anything, if you lay a really solid foundation, generally it lasts longer. - Yeah, well, that foundation again, is that technique, or is there, what does it take to\nbuild that foundation? - I think technique, you get away with murder, you know? (Lex laughing) - [Lex] Yeah. - With technique, you can get away with\nhaving bad condition, but I mean, you get found out in the end, but you can you can go out and you can win certain things by doing really nice technique, but I think if you've got the mixture, if you've got the whole package, then you can go the whole way. - So for people who somehow don't know, you've commentated some of the\ngreatest judo matches ever. You've done Grand Prix. You've done all these events, Olympics, Championship, everything. So what, just looking\nat the history of judo, what stands out to you? What events stand out to you? What are some good memories\nthat pop to your head? - I think some of the Paris\ntournaments are amazing because the crowd, they're there, you know? They're on the mat. They're all judoka. They're well-educated to the sport. Every time somebody twitches, you know, they're very biased towards their own, which kind of you expect. But sometimes I haven't been\nable to hear myself speak, and that's very unusual. You know, you've got headphones\non and you're blocked out, and sometimes Teddy Riner's\nbeen walking out there, and the crowd are going crazy, and they're on their feet\nwhen somebody twitches. And then you get the crowd silencers. We had one of those last week, you know, everybody's cheering\ntheir man, and then, bang, their man goes over. - And they're just silent. (laughs) - Silence, nothing like that. And of course, we were commentating. We were going, \"That was a bit of a crowd silencer.\" But, yeah, that happens. - Yeah, that is the surprising thing that, at least it was to me, that Paris and France\nis really big on judo. - Massive. And there's always surprises. You know, it's like, Paris is great. In Japan for the Olympic Games, the biggest surprise\nwas Ono getting beaten in the team event. Now, Ono's the greatest\njudo man, pound for pound, probably one of the best. And he won the Olympic title. And then they went into the\nteam event against France, and Ono lost to a, he's not run-of-the-mill German, but the German, you know, he wasn't certainly Olympic titlist, and beat Ono. - Yeah, well, the team\nstuff is fascinating. - [Neil] Yeah, fascinating. - It changes the dynamics\nof the whole thing. And I mean, it's funny you say Paris. It really makes it a really big deal that this Olympics is being held in Paris. - And they'll be the team\nto beat, French team, because they have the best\nbalance of the weight categories. They have the best\nbalance with their people that are World and Olympic Champions and qualified men and women. So three men, three women. They have the best balance out of anybody. - And an educated audience. - Educated audience. Home ground. - It's gonna be awesome.\n- It's gonna be a mat. - [Lex] It's gonna be super fun.- - It will be super fun. - Are you nervous? - [Neil] Yeah. - All right. (laughs)\n- [Neil] Do you get nervous? - I get nervous. - [Neil] I do as well,\nI get really nervous. - I'm nervous right now. (laughs) But, you know, given, especially because it's the Olympics, and you don't want to, you want to celebrate people properly. And it's everything for them. - [Neil] Yeah. - And a lot of people, especially like the finals matches. - [Neil] Yeah. - It'll be watched millions of times, the highest of stakes, all of this. - Played over and over. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I find that with mine, I'm now a little bit\nmore careful with like, so I'll celebrate a massive throw and then have empathy to\nthe one that's been thrown, because it's not the best\nfeeling in the world, especially in Olympic Finals. Can you imagine that? - Yeah. - It must be terrible. - It must be terrible, yeah. - Just reflecting. So, no, I have a bit of empathy there, and I just try and say the right things, because they always do\ncome up to me and say, \"You commentated my fights.\" - Yeah, you're the voice\nof the biggest triumphs and the biggest tragedies\nfor these athletes, for the world that watches\nand admires these athletes. - No pressure. - You're the voice. Don't screw it up, Neil. - Don't screw it up. - Your voice is in my\nhead when I watch these. You know, it's fascinating. It's fascinating, but\nyou're a master of it. It's a huge honor that\nyou would talk with me. Thank you for everything you've\ndone for the sport of judo, for the Olympics, for just sports in general, just celebrating greatness\nin all of its forms. Thank you for talking\ntoday, and keep going. I can't wait to listen to you in Paris. - Thank you for having me, and it's just been an\nhonor to be here with you. - Thanks for listening to this\nconversation with Neil Adams.
