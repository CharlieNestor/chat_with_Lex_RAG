      "text": "- If I hate you, that's great. But if I have a story\nto support that hate, ah, that's even better. - One of your favorite words, jihad? (Bassem laughs) - That's my favorite hobbies. It doesn't matter now, who\ndo you vote into power, they will not listen to you, they would listen to the people\nwho paid them to be there. When the military came in,\npeople were walking to me, like, pointing their fingers like,\n\"Don't speak about this, don't speak about the army, huh? We love you now, but don't you.\" They were like that. So I called Jon Stewart. I was like, \"I don't know what to do.\" And he said the most\ninteresting thing ever, and he said, \"If you're\nafraid of something, make fun about the fact\nthat you're afraid of it.\" - The following is a\nconversation with Bassem Youssef, a legendary Egyptian-American comedian, the so-called Jon Stewart\nof the Middle East who fearlessly satirized those in power even when his job and\nlife were on the line. Bassem is a beautiful human being. It was truly a pleasure\nfor me to get to know him and to have this fun, fascinating, and challenging conversation. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Bassem Youssef."

      "text": "Your wife is half-Palestinian, and I've heard you say that\nyou've been trying to kill her, but she keeps using the\nkids as human shields. So have you considered\nnegotiating a ceasefire? - Well, the thing is, every\nday, every minute of the day in a married life is a negotiation. Everything can blow up\ninto a full-scale war. Starting from a simple sentence like, good morning, what should\nwe do with the kids today? What should we do with\nthat piece of furniture? Any sentence can lead you to heaven or to hell in the same time. - So, you do negotiate with terrorists? - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, 100%.\n- You must? - Yeah, and for her,\nI'm her terrorist too. So, it's equal. (chuckles) - Terrorist on both sides. On a more serious note, when you found out about\nthe attacks of October 7th, what went through your mind? - If I'm allowed to use\na curse word, I was like- - As many as possible.\n- I was like, \"Oh, shit.\" Part of my standup comedy\nis, I describe a situation where I was in a\nrestaurant with producers. And there was a bombing two blocks away in Chelsea, New York in 2016. And of course, this is the like, damn, what's gonna happen to us now? And there's, like, two\ndifferent reactions, there's, like, the white\nreaction, which is like, oh, my God, I hope nobody\nis hurt, this is terrible. I hope everybody's okay. And there's the Arab reaction, What's his name, what's is his name? What is the name, you know? Because you know what's gonna come. I was scared what's gonna\nreally happen in that area. And I said like, \"Oh, my\nGod, it's gonna be horrible.\" And the way that it was reported, I didn't know how to handle this. So basically, I went into\nhiding for a few days, three or four days. And I talked about Piers Morgan team talking to me two times, three times. I was like, \"No, I can't.\nHow can you defend that? How can you defend the rape, the decapitated babies and whatever?\" And then I started kind of\nlooking in the news a little bit, and then I started seeing\npeople coming on the shows and saying things that I\nknow as an Arab, as a Muslim, as someone from that\nregion, that it's not true. But I didn't know what\nto say, how to say it. So I said, by the third\ntime when they asked me, I said like, \"Fine, put me on.\" And I went there, it was\nmore of a, (chuckles) figuratively speaking, a\nsuicide mission. (chuckles) Because it's a lose-lose situation. I can lose stuff in Hollywood. I remember my managers\nlike, \"Bassem, be careful. I mean, are you sure you wanna do it?\" My manager was like, \"Please don't do it. Please don't do it.\" And on the other side,\nif I don't perform well, whatever well means, I'm gonna\nbe rejected by my own people. So it was a lose-lose situation, because whatever I say,\nit will never be enough, and whatever I say will\nnot be good enough. And I was going into there, and I felt that I was going into a\ntrance for the 33 minutes that I was on that interview\nfor the first time. - You blacked out?\n- I blacked out. I blacked out, and a\nlot of people asked me, \"Is the earpiece, was that a bit?\" When the earpiece kept falling. It's like, no, it was really falling off and it disconnected, and I had to save it because I cannot see them. I can just hear them, and I\ncould expecting at any time, \"Okay, Bassem, thank you.\" I was like, I was fighting\nfor every second to say words, to put stuff in there. - Yeah, for people who don't know, this is your conversation, interview with Piers Morgan\nand you couldn't see. - I couldn't see, I was just like, the lens of the camera and I was- - Just like a surreal dream or nightmare. - Yeah, hello, Bassem.\nHe's like, \"Hello, Bassem.\" I was like, \"Hi.\" (laughs) - [Lex] And it could end at any moment, your career and everything. - Everything, yeah, yeah. - [Lex] So, what was\nthe drive that got you to actually do it, to overcome that fear? - Multiple things. First of all, I don't wanna\nsay it's just my wife's family, because my wife's family\nhas always been there, but this time was different. The bombing, the attack, they're usually one of those people that they're away of everything. Whatever happened in Gaza,\nthey are always in safe places. But this time, it seems that\nthere was no place safe. And already, we heard about, like, two, three of the cousins and the uncles already lost their home. So, this was too much. So, I wanted to say\nsomething for those people, because I know that, you know, one of the jokes that I made about like, \"Oh, you know, Hassan,\nher cousin, he's a loser,\" He's a doctor, he's a doctor. And every time a hospital was bombed, we were worried about him. So, I wanted to say that\nbecause I felt that these are, this is a family that I\nhave never seen in my life. I've never, she actually\nhardly saw an uncle or two, because, you know, they cannot leave. But I said like, I need to speak, at least I do something\nfor those extended family that I have never known. But also because when Piers Morgan team called me a couple of times, I said, \"Okay, let's see what's\ngoing on in the show.\" And I just watched the stuff, and the lies and the one-sided reporting, that made my blood boil. And then I thought, like,\nwhat am I afraid of? I'm afraid of if I say\nsomething, I can lose my career. I was like, wait a minute. But that was the reason why I left Egypt. I said, wait, I left Egypt. I came to United States. I came to the land of the free where I can say anything I want, and yet I have limitation of what to say? I mean, I thought we\nleft that shit behind. I mean, what's happening? And I understand, I\nunderstand the connection of like, how sensitive it is\nwhen you speak about Israel and all of the ready-made accusations. But as an Arab, as a Muslim,\nI don't react the same when you talk about Saudi Arabia or Iran or Egypt or any of them. It's like, \"Hey, you wanna\ndiss some of these countries? I'll do that with you.\" Because I have strong\nopinions about what happened, and I already been expressing them. And there's a lot of Jewish people who come to my show, and\nthey understand that. They understand the separation, but that kind of a grouping\nof blackmailing people and saying and not saying\nwhat they have in their mind, it is that kind of,\nlike, one of the things that kind of, like, pushed\nme to go on the show. - The thing that was bothering you was it what was being said\nor how it was being said? - Both, because there are lies, which is usually in the media, but there was the total\ndisregard of humanity. You talk a lot about in your\nshow about human suffering. And I felt that here, the\nhuman suffering was not equal. That's why I came up with this, like, what's the exchange rate today? What's the exchange rate today? Of course, it's terrible\nto see anybody die, but I feel that like, isn't\nour life not worth anything? - Yeah, you had a chart. - Yeah.\n- That came to crypto. - Yeah.\n- You analyze it from an investing perspective, of course, in a dark humor- - That's the ROI on that.\n- ROI. (Bassem laughs) And that you were saying that a certain year was a good year. - Yeah, 2014.\n- 2014 was a good year for investment purposes. And also to refer to the family member that you called a loser, you were saying that you called him, had a conversation with him, and he keeps saying that\nhe's not using anybody for human shields, and then\nyou called him a loser. What are you, you can't even give a job. - The liar, he lied to us\nbecause I have to believe. But this is the one thing, it's like, it's also one of the things,\nlike, how it was said. It was stuff that I've been hearing. I don't know what turned on in my head, but it's stuff that I've been hearing all my life from the media. Israel warns civilians\nbefore bombing them. And that's okay, but that's not okay. Israel is trying to\nminimize the civilians, but killing them anyway. And that's okay, but that's not okay. So it is kind of, like, the indoctrination that we've been hearing as if it is okay, and then, suddenly, it's not. - Yeah, there's a kind of\nseveral layers of bullshit, almost sometimes hiding the obvious horror of the situation with kind of politeness and all this kind of stuff. Just the basic value of human life. That said, it's a difficult situation. - It is, it is. - What would you do if you were Israel? Bibi called you, Bassem, big\nfan, big fan of your comedy. - Mm-hm.\n- First of all, would you hang up right away? Would you hear him out? - Oh, I will definitely\nhear him out. (laughs) I was like, that was like, \"Wait a minute! That's material, that's material. That's material, man.\" (both laugh) It was like, so Netanyahu called me. (both laugh) - Yeah.\n- I was sitting with my family, it's like, I'm on my phone and was like, oh, Netanyahu. (both laugh) - Yeah, it just shows up that way. I mean, what would you do? What would you do in this situation? - To answer this question, we need to understand how Israel thinks. There is an incredible\nspeech given by Gideon Levy at a famous Israeli report in Haaretz. And he describes a situation where he was in the West Bank\nand there was a checkpoint. And in that checkpoint, there was an ambulance\nwith a Palestinian patient. And it was there sitting for\nan hour and a half, not moving. And then he went to talk to the soldiers, like, \"Guys, why are you\nnot letting them go?\" He's like, \"Ah, let them go.\" And then he told them, \"Imagine\nif he was your father.\" And the soldiers stood up and was like, \"What? These are pigs. These are not humans.\" So when you tell me what would\nyou do if Israel would do, we need to ask, how does\nIsrael look at the Palestinian and view the Palestinians? Because they do look at\nthem less than human. And there is an incredible talk by Meyer. He was a holocaust survivor. And he said, \"I learned in Auschwitz when I was there in the concentration camp that in order for a\ndominant group of people to dehumanize another group, they need first to dehumanize themselves.\" And Israel looks at\nPalestinians as lesser people, as lesser beings, as some\npeople who are dispensable. And the way that they treat them is that they don't really care about, like, that's why that\nthe exchange rate thing. So for me, if I am\nIsrael, it will be like, what would you do if\nyou're the United States in the time of the Native Americans? They were killing people\nwith the millions. When you dehumanize a group of people, you really don't care. So if I was Israel, I would do exactly what Israel is doing right now, because there is no one\nis holding me accountable. There's no one stopping me,\nand I can get whatever I want throughout my a history through violence. - I think a lot of the\nthings you just said are a tiny bit slightly exaggerated. So, let me try. - Please, please, please.\n- Let's try. So not everybody in Israel.\n- Of course. - So let's look at several groups. So people in government, IDF soldiers and citizens that are neither of those. And not everybody of any\nof those sees Palestinians as less than human, just some percentage. So what percentage is that in your sense? - It's the people who have the power. - So it's mostly the\nfocus of your commentary. When you say people in Israel, you really mean the people in power. - The people have in power. But as much as, like, of course, I mean, the people of power. Because even when I speak about America, I speak about people in power. When I speak about Egypt, I\nspeak the people about power, because, like, you can't really talk about the 100 million people in Egypt or the 11 million people in Israel. Of course, not, there are people who go in and they demonstrate against Netanyahu and they want him out of the government. But we have to admit\nthat the Israeli society, at a whole, have moved\nquite bit to the right and has been, like, many extreme. And you know what happens\nwhen you go to the right or you go to the most extreme, the other person go to the most extreme. And extremism breeds extremism. So thank you for that clarification. But like, I really meant\nwith the people of power. When people criticize the\nUnited States for going in Iraq, of course, I'm not criticizing citizens. - But you made another point,\nwhich is an interesting point, and it's very difficult to\nsee in the heart of people, but I wonder if you look\nat the average Palestinian and the average Israeli, and\nwhen they look at the other, do they have some hate in their heart? Well, everybody probably has some. What is that amount? You know, when you look at a person that looks different than\nyou, how much hate is there? - It depends on what is the\nliving situation of each person. So in the Berlin Film Festival, just like a couple of weeks\nago, there was an Israeli and a Palestinian receiving\nan award together. And the Israeli director said, we're gonna go back to Israel. He's gonna go to the West Bank. He will have no rights, and I\nwill have full living rights. These people managed to work\ntogether and be friends, and they have empathy to each other. Now the average Palestinian,\nit's a very difficult question. Because is it the Palestinian in the diaspora or the\nPalestinian in Gaza, or the diaspora in the West Bank, or the one as a citizen of\nIsrael who still have less right than a normal citizen of Israel, the Jew? And it really depends. There are Arabs in Israel\nwho are having a great life. And there are people, Arabs, who are having a miserable life. But definitely, people that living in Gaza or in the West Bank is kind of, like, on the lower tier of\nthe living conditions. Now let's talk about the hate. What does that Palestinian\nsee with the Israeli? The Palestinians see oppression, limitation of movement,\nlimitation of freedom. And then when there's something happens, you see the full force coming\nin, destroying their home, taking away members of his family. There would be absolutely no reason for him to love the other. The Israeli, because, you know,\nhe doesn't have the power, but he lives under his government, all he sees is the rockets or whatever. But like, he sees the reaction and he doesn't see what happened to those. And as humans, we are selfish. We see what really affects us as humans. And I cannot even imagine what it would be like to\nlive as a Palestinian. And I'm not even talking about Gaza, because everybody talks about Gaza. But let me give you an example, and I'm not gonna talk about\nthe 12,000 kids killed in Gaza. Let's talk about just like the\nfour weeks in the West Bank. March 4th, Amr al-Najjar, age 10, sitting next to his father,\nshot while he's sitting in the car next to his\nfather by the IDF soldiers. Mohammed Zayed, 13 years old, March 3rd, shot in front of a UN school\nwhile sitting with his friends. Mohammad Ghnaim, age 15, March 2nd, he shot while standing in front of a storefront during a night raid. February 23rd, Saeed Jaradat,\nhe was killed by a drone fire. February 22nd, Fadi Suleiman killed while standing in front of a\ntop of a Red Cross building. Nihil Ziad, February\n14th, Valentine's Day, killed and shot in the\nhead while leaving school. February 11th, Mohammad\nKhdour, US citizens, killed while being in a parked car. And Moed Shams, February 9th, killed right in front of his home because a military car\ncame reversing back to him, and then somebody opened the\ndoor, shot him and leave. This is a daily life of\npeople in the West Bank. - What is the justification\nthat IDF provides? - Terrorism.\n- Terrorism? - Or I don't know. I mean, you cannot really\nsay, like, human shields, but they would say like,\n\"They were throwing rocks.\" There was a guy who went on Chris Rock and he said like, his son,\na US citizen will kill. And they're like, they\nwere throwing rocks, so we killed him. Even when they were throwing\nrocks, you kill him? But the thing is, you see, this is how easy for them\nto get rid of Palestinians. I had to say I prepared a\nlittle bit for the podcast, because you are in tech. And I am ignorant in tech. There is a movie called \"The Lab.\" It is directed by an Israeli, a director called Yotam Feldman. And he talks about how\nthe military industry in Israel is very advanced. And what is really mind\nboggling is in that movie, he shows how the military\ntests its weapons in the field, in urban areas on Palestinians. It is heartbreaking. You know, as a doctor,\nthere's five stages of trials. There is discovery, preclinical,\nclinical, and then market, and then post-market\nevaluation by the FDA. The FDA approval and\nthen the FDA post-market. Five just to take a pill. And you go in, and he\ninterviews people as like, \"Where did you test this?\" They tested in the field. So when you just like,\nwhen human life so cheap and it is so indispensable, it gave me a visceral\nreaction, because you know, this has been actually\nthe state of humanity. Humanity have lived\nand survived and thrive by actually killing each other. But there was kind of like\na, we are removed from it. People in Greece didn't know what the Alexander the Great was doing. He was killing and pillaging. We call him the great, but he was killing. He was conquering, he was invading. Julius Caesar, all of the\ngreats, he would do it. But killing was difficult. Killing had to have some sort, you have to be with your enemy. Then you go back, catapults, then cannons, then a little bit back, and then you're kind of,\nlike, starting remotely. Now, you're killing people\nbehind the screen with a button, with a push of a button, you know? A lot of people say, \"Terrorism, they killed you with a knife.\" Killed one person with a knife,\nshot you, that's terrorism. But if you fly a $64 million F-16 and you drop up an A-84\nbomb that costs $16,000, that's not terrorism because it's remote. You're behind the screen. So what happened? What Israel is doing? It is removing itself. Like America too, drones. And then when you push someone to be in, they always brag about bombing\nthem to the stone ages. What happens when the screens\nand all of the obstacles that you have been put\nbetween you and those people, that you have treated them this way, when this is a breach and\nyou come face-to-face, you will come face-to-face\nwith what you have created. - Yeah, there's a lot of\ninteresting things you just said. So one is the methodology of killing. If you wanna look at some\nhorrific large-scale killing, people often talk about the\nHolocaust, but that's visceral. You can look at Holodomor by Stalin where the murder is through starvation. - By Churchill in India. - Churchill in India. And The Great Leap Forward.\n- Mm-hm. - By Mao.\n- Yep. - So starvation is a thing we don't often think of it as murder, because it's quiet, it's slow. And the interesting thing about starvation is that the people don't\ncomplain as they're dying, because they're exhausted. That's one, and the other\nis the value of human life. It does seem that every culture has a unequal valuation of human life. So those two things combined create a complicated military\nlandscape of the world. - Yes, but thing is, is\nthat how we would look at technology as the savior? We talk about how AI\ndisrupt, will disrupt, will disrupt, will disrupt. And now, you talk about,\nlike, going to the West Bank, the people in the West Bank walk and they don't see humans. They see people shooting them from towers or behind the screens or doing, and they have like biometrics that is developed by Basil Systems, like, that's done by HP or Google and Amazon who are, like,\npart of Project Nimbus. And you see, in division,\ndeveloping all of this, like, metric and surveillance\nand all of that stuff. And then, you have, like,\nsomething, like, the gospel that, like, people have actually said that the gospel can actually\ncreate a target list using AI and give you a green,\nyellow or a red to go ahead. And now, AI is not just\ndisrupting the market, it's disrupting our humanity. And we became so comfortable\nkilling people from afar, killing people with a push of the button. And now, it's like dating apps, you know, when you swipe left and right,\nand it's like, oh, right. It becomes so, like, cheap. It's not like meeting someone. It's like, ah, ah, ah. It's like a lot of fish in the sea. Same with AI, boom, 500 people killed. Boom, they killed. It's so easy, it's so easy, it's so easy. And then it's so far removed from you. So when you put these\npeople in this condition, you have literally put them in a different universe than yours. You are behind in your\nair-conditioned screens like, pushing them, blowing\nup a university, it's amazing. But then you meet what you have done, that you meet the Frankenstein\nthat you have created. And then people are like, \"Oh,\nlook what they did to us.\" - You just gave me this\nimage of a dating app from hell where leaders\nare just sitting there and kind of swiping left, right. - Just like, invade, destroy. (laughs) - Its boring. - Like a puppet government. (laughs) - Yeah, and then turn off\nthe phone, go to sleep. So you know, I traveled to the West Bank and I mentioned to you offline that I really loved the people there. Just, you know, yeah, I've met\na bunch of people like that in Eastern Europe where I grew up. Yeah, like the flamboyant, the big personalities, all of that. I also met a person who's\nin charge of a refugee camp who was shot by an IDF soldier. And I'm not sure the words\nhe said are important as the consequences of the\nthing that you mentioned, which is the deep hate in his eyes. That didn't feel repairable at all. It was pain, it was like\na foundation of pain and on top of that, a hatred. And I was like, \"Wow, you kill one person, this is what you create.\" - Because we have kind of, like, a front row seat to what's happening, we think we are in it, but\nwe can't really grasp it. I mean, people's like, \"Oh,\nwe're just gonna go in, get Hamas out and we're\ngonna get them back in.\" And what about the people get back in, how do you think they would look at you? What have you created? What have you done? My show in Egypt was all about propaganda. It's all about the use of words. Words are very important. The decapitated babies\nwere not chosen randomly. Because you see, it plants a\ncertain image in your brain. Imagine if you're going\nin, what a baby can do? It can smile, cry and poop, that's it. It's absolutely no threat. So when you tell people,\n\"40 decapitated babies,\" they're so animalistic,\nthey didn't see the babies. Women raped, of course,\nhe's an animal to do that. And they would go through that, and what was very frustrating about the conversation\nis the gish galloping. The gish galloping, throwing. You see the distractions,\nyou see what happens? Like, it's like, what's\nthe proportionate response? Can Israel defend itself? Do you condemn Hamas? Does Israel has a right to exist? Decapitated babies, raped women, why don't the Arab countries take them? Muslims kill Muslims. Look what happened in\nYemen, in Syria, in Iraq. Like, see how they kind of distract you? They throw little things at you so you don't know what to do. Or the UNRWA, the UN, anti-Semitic. October 7th, October 7th, October 7th. And then suddenly, you are distracted and pulled into discussing\nall of these little things, and you're not discussing\nwhat's happening right now. It is basically stalling, giving them time to do what they do. - So there's some degree\nto the propaganda though. So the beheaded babies and\nall this kind of stuff, that is so over the top that it shuts down actual conversation about actual wrongs, war crimes on both sides. So it's overstating it to\nwhere everyone on social media and everywhere in the press\nand everywhere is arguing, almost become desensitized\nto actual horrors of death, which are more mundane. They're not so dramatic\nas beheaded babies. - Yeah, because a baby is\nshot, but decapitated babies. There's like a knife blade\nthat goes into the skin, the trachea, the flesh, the spine. Decapitated. You can just, like, he's dead. But no, you go in, this is the\nhate. This is so much hate. And you know, that's why- - You have made me laugh (Bassem laughs) at the darkest shit. You're such a beautiful person. Your dark humor is just wonderful. - But you see this\nhappened to Jews before. Remember, blood libel?\n- Yeah. - Where did the blood libel come from? - Yeah.\n- It come from these rumors that Jews suck baby's blood. This is what they did to them.\n- Yeah, yeah. - That's what's in the cup.\n- Exactly. (Bassem laughs) That's a very delicious baby cup. - Delicious baby blood.\n- But this is what you do. You tell people something. And it happened with the Native Americans when they were here, when they went in and they wipe a whole tribe. And Jewish people, one of the, like, the minorities that were persecuted and had this used against\nthem for a very long time. And it is terrible and it's terrifying. That's being used again. - So, I just did a very lengthy debate on Israel and Palestine. And the really painful thing from that, those two historians, it was deep, it was thorough, it was fascinating. But in constantly asking about sources of hope or solutions, there was none. There was a sense of, like, a really dark sense of, it's hopeless. From both sides, it's hopeless. So you know, I look to you (both laugh) for a source of hope. Is there any hope here,\nsolutions, short-term, long-term? - Obama have kind of summarized this beautifully in his book. He said, \"The reason why the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict is so chronic is one\nside have so much power and the other side have\nabsolutely no power.\" And that's the one what he says. He said like, \"You have Israel,\" that they basically don't listen to us, because they're supported by people who are bigger than the president, bigger than administration. They know that they can. I mean, like, Netanyahu was\ncaught on tape many times saying like, he's basically,\nlike, belittling Americans. Like, we control 80% of the\npopulation, we don't care. This has kind of, like, nonchalant kind of, like, we have them. And there's nothing really that compels Israel to give up anything. Because at the end of the\nday, what is compromise? Compromise is, like, I give something, you give something. Israelis don't giving anything, and they project that on you. So for example, how many\ntimes have we heard like, \"Oh, Palestinians were given\nlike 4, 5, 6, 7, 15 chances, and they said no to them.\" And yet when you read the history, that's not the case at all. Like, for example, the\nwhole idea about, like, Arafat walked away from\nOslo, that didn't happen. And there is an incredible video by, you know, what's his name? Joe Scarborough with Misha. And they were hosting\nher father, Brzezinski, he was the national security advisor. And Joe Scarborough said like, \"Well, you know, like,\nArafat left the Oslo Accord and the Palestinians left.\" And then Brzezinski said like, \"This is, like, embarrassingly shallow.\" It's like, listen, what happened was, there was a lot of catches\non the Oslo Accord. It was very unfair to the Palestinians. So Arafat has said like, \"I agree, but I need to take\nit to the Arab capitals.\" And they went to Sharm\nEl-Sheik, they came to Egypt. And he and Ehud Barak went to there. And then Ehud Barak left\nbecause there was election, and he lost, Ariel Sharon\ncame, and it was destroyed. This is one of the reason why people, it's kind of, like, facts\ndon't matter as much as what is the narrative\nthat has been controlled. - What were the biggest\nbarriers to peace there? Do you think it's, fundamentally, leaders don't want a two-state solution? Or was there nuanced small differences that if solved could have\nled to a two-state solution? - I mean, maybe there was a certain point when the Israeli leaders\nwere more open to compromise. But I can't say that, because each time Israel gives back land, it has to be after some use of force. The 1973 war, the Antifa,\nthe first and second, the casualties in Gaza. They never give up land\nwillingly and because of peace. Because if I have that much military, I can do whatever I want. Why would I give up anything? I have that much power. Why would America or China give everything if they're so powerful? And especially, if they\nhave this kind of open check from the United States. So, it is really about what can push Israel to give up something? Because you are so much stronger than me. What could compel you\nto give up something? And this is why the\nwhole thing about, like, trying to equalize Palestinians and the Israeli state and government, it doesn't make any sense."

      "text": "- So what is the source of hope? You know, Jon Stewart,\nwho we'll talk about from many angles, somebody\nyou admire, a friend, he proposed a two-state solution. - [Bassem] Of course. - Look to the comedians for hope. - Yes, well, everybody's talking about the two-state solution, but Israel has said\nmany times on Netanyahu, like, there's gonna be no state solutions. In the past, it's like,\neven Naftali Bennett, he came in on \"HARDtalk.\" He's like, yeah, maybe in the past, we wanted two-state solutions. But like, look, every time we\ngive them land, they kill us. So no state solutions, and\nthey are openly saying it. - But that's perhaps rhetoric. - The rhetoric that is\nsupported by action. Because look at what they're doing in the West Bank that you said. They are cutting it, illegal\nsettlement, piecemealing it. So if you have an intention\nat all to give them anything, why would you keep doing this? - And you've called it\na bunch of little Gazas. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n- It's a nice little picture of what's happening. - Piecemealing it, what happened in the past four months, the Palestinians have\nbeen microdosing on it for a very long time, little\nby little, little by little. And we would shout every time when it gets too much\nand then we shut down. And then little by little,\nbut this time it was hard. It was hard to see the blatant oppression. And the world said,\n\"Maybe the Hamas Ministry of Health are giving us the bad numbers. Maybe it's just human shield.\" And I laugh, there's 13,000 babies killed. Does that mean that there\nare 13,000 military target hiding in their diapers? Because it doesn't make any\nsense to kill that many babies. It's like, \"Oh, oops,\njust out of our hands.\" - It's hard to know what\nto do with those numbers. I mean, just one baby is enough. - But you know what happens\nwhen you hear so many numbers? Numbers become numbers, and\nyou become so desensitized. And this is why there's a difference between saying 13,000\nPalestinian kids dead, just like Mila Cohen, an\nIsraeli baby, 10-month old. She was killed in her crib. And this is what we hear from CNN. We never hear a story\nabout the Palestinian kid. That's why thank you\nfor giving me the space for saying the news of\nthe Palestinian children that were killed just for four weeks. Like, it's because humans needs context. They need depth. They need, like, a 3D look\nat what they can look at. But if you just tell 'em numbers, oh, they don't mean anything. - Is there some degree to\nwhere both leaderships, Hamas, PA, Palestinian\nAuthority, Israel, all want war? Like, perpetual war to remain in power? - That's an interesting question. But I mean, let's admit something. The Arab regimes in the\narea have actually used the problem of Palestine\nin order to stay in power, in order to get excuses\nto like, have this enemy, and Israel, the Israeli\ngovernment has used that too, and maybe the Palestinians. But my problem with when\ngoing into discussion this is that the two sides are not equal. They're not equal in power,\nthey're not equal in influence, and they're not equal in\ninternational supports, especially with the United States. So people who have made changes in history were the people with power. The people who would have\nthe ability to change things, and the Palestinians cannot really change. What can they change? - Well, is that true though?\n- Okay. - With how much support the\nPalestinian people have? So just like you said, there's\na lot of Arab states there that will voice their\npro-Palestinian position in order to distract\nfrom the own corruption and abuses of power in\ntheir own countries. But you know, I don't\nthink, if you look globally, there's a complete asymmetry of power and public opinion here, maybe\nin the press in the West. But if you look globally- - But do they have the\nsame kind of weapons that the Israeli have? - Literally power, no. There's a major asymmetry\nof literal power. - Some money to their leaders. Does that make any difference? I mean, and also when you\nsay Palestinian authority, which authority are you talking about? Hamas or the Palestinian authority who has been kind of a\ndomesticated kind of, like, a puppy, Palestinian\nwho basically have been an informant on their own people. And this is the thing also that kind of, like, really pissed me off when I was hearing the\nthing about these things. Like, Hamas, Hamas, Hamas, Hamas. Like, we have Netanyahu on tape confessing that he supported Hamas\ngiving money in order to cause factions\nbetween the Palestinians. So it's just like, you just told me this. You just told me this. You just told me, did\nNetanyahu support Hamas? It's like, but Hamas, like, what? - [Lex] I mean, to which\ndegree does Netanyahu represent the Israeli people is a real question. - To which point does Trump or Biden represent the American people? - And to which degree does Hamas represent the Palestinian people? - It doesn't. None of these represent it, but who have the power in\norder to make the decisions? It really comes down to that. - Well, who does have the power? You're giving a lot of power to Israel. - Yeah.\n- But the Arab League- - What should Hamas do? What do you think would Hamas do? - Continue doing what a charter says, which is trying to destroy Israel. And the role of the Palestinian\npeople is to overthrow Hamas and get a more moderate\nleadership probably. And the role of the Israeli people is to vote out this right-wing government and elect a more moderate leader, so that there's a chance at\npeace with two moderate leaders. - [Bassem] So before Hamas\neven got to control 2006 Gaza, there was Ariel Sharon in 2000. And we all know what happened. And Ariel Sharon kind of, like, came up with this amazing policy of, like, breaking people's kids'\nbones in the intifada. So, Ehud Barak, he was also like, I mean, which one is moderate? I mean, I think Hamas is a\nproduct of what happened. I mean, if there was no\napartheid in South Africa, there would be no NFC. There will be no Nelson Mandela. If there was no Nazis in Paris, there would be no French resistance. And I'm not saying that. And again, I don't wanna\nbe put in a position to defend Hamas or anybody, because you know what that entails, but those are like, Hamas,\nagain, not defending them, they went into October\n7th, why did they did that? Like, release our hostages,\nthe people in prison. Because if you talk about\npeople who are kidnapped, Israel kidnaps people every single day. And when they had that, the\nfirst exchange in November 4th, Israel leaves 400 people, 3/4 of them were women and children. Why are those people in prison? There's one in four\nkids that are imprisoned that stay in solitary confinement, which is, by international\nlaw, a form of torture. And you're putting kids through that. - So first of all, ceasefire. - Yes.\n- And longer term, is it possible for Arab states and the United States to get together, and with power through\ndiplomacy, enforce a solution? - It's a very, very ideal solution. But you know and I know that Arab states don't\nreally have the power. All of the powers are\nin the hands of America. - They have the power. See, I think they have the power. I don't- - Maybe they don't wanna use it. - They don't wanna, well, that's- - [Bassem] Maybe they don't wanna- - Because there's a benefit.\n- Maybe there's a benefit. - Like, the dark sense I have\nis that a lot of people win from the suffering the\nPalestinians are going through, because they can point to\nthat and distract from- - [Bassem] Definitely, definitely. - Corruption in their own states. And then obviously, Iran can benefit also from the same kind of dynamic distracting from the authoritarian\nnature of their regime. - Definitely, but what is\nthe core of the problem here? Is it the Arab states using the suffering? Or actually the suffering itself? And the suffering comes\nfrom people being displaced. Their homes were taken away. There are 7 million\nPalestinians in diaspora. 7 millions, 7 million went out there, and now they're living in\nCanada and America and Europe. They had homes there\nthey cannot go back to. 1.7 million people of the people in Gaza don't belong in Gaza. They were pushed from other places. The piecemeal thing of\npeople are being, you know, in Germany, I'm gonna\nshift gear a little bit. It's gonna be a little bit of fun. There is a book that I\nbought the rights to, and I want to turn it into a movie. And I bought, I auctioned the right for two years in March of\nlast year, before October 7th. After October 7th, I\nbought the permanent right. That book is called \"The\nMuslim and the Jew.\" And it is written by an\nauthor called Ronen Steinke. I read an article about this book in 2016, and I chased that book for\nrights for seven years. I didn't have that much\nmoney, but I wanted that book. And that book was translated into English called \"Anna and Dr. Helmy.\" And that book tells the incredible\nstory under Nazi Germany where Arabs went in\ndroves to Berlin in 1920s after the 1st World War\nin the Weimar Republic. And they became doctors and engineers and journalists for two reasons. Number one, they're cheap, very cheap because of the inflation. And two, a lot of the Arab nationalists, they didn't want to send their\nkids to England or France, because they were the occupiers. And Dr. Helmy was the hero of that. He's an Egyptian doctor. And that's why I kind of like, I personally kind of connected with him. And he went to medical school, didn't find a place to live. So he lived in the Jewish\nghetto, like many Arabs. He didn't find a hospital to work in, so he worked in a Jewish hospital. So there was a lot of\nArabs who lived together, and actually the first\ndirector of the Berlin Mosque with a Jewish convert\nwho converted to Islam, and he was a gay activist. I'm telling you, this\nis, like, a crazy story. - [Lex] Yeah. - And this is not a fiction story, this is actually, like, a nonfiction. It's written actually\nbased on the statement, the documents of the Nazis in the Gestapo. Dr. Helmy, he was in this hospital. And the Nazis came in and they killed and tortured and beat\nup the Jewish doctor. And they made him the\nhead of his department. So now, he's surrounded by Nazi doctor. They didn't touch him\nbecause he was an Arab. There was kind of, like, a thing between Germany and the Arabs, because they wanted to appease to them in order to have kind of a grassroots base in the Arab world where\nhe want to go next. And this is why 1934-1935, the racial laws of Nuremberg,\nthey had a name change. First they were called anti-Semitic. Then they changed into anti-Jewish, because also Arabs were Semetic. So they wanted to appease the Arabs. Now, what happened, Dr. Helmy, when that happened to him, he\nwould go back to the ghetto and he would see the\napartments next to him. The Jewish apartment become more and more and more flooded with people, because they were moving\nJews and pushing them and putting them together,\npushing them to the side. And each flat, each apartment,\ninstead of one family, it would have three,\nfour, six, seven families. And he was there going at home, and he looked, he was there. This is where the people he\ngrew up with, he lived with. And now, he's seeing that\nkind of discrimination just because he was an Arab. And then he started to kind of, like, atone for, like, because\nhe felt responsible, because he wasn't treated the same way. And he started to go\nand treat Jewish people in their homes, because they\ncouldn't go to hospitals. And then one family\ngave them his daughter. It's like, \"This is Anna, save her.\" He took her, pretended\nthat she's his niece, put a hijab around her, taught\nher Arabic, called her Nadia, my daughter's name by the way. And he hid her in plain\nsight for seven years in front of the Nazis as his nurse. It's an incredible story. And then not just that he went to prison, and then he went out and he\nformed with the Arab people that was in prison with him a\nnetwork that saves 300 Jews. You see that kind of story? This is the Jews that were\nliving in the Arab world. I'm not saying that the\nJews living the Arad world was living, like, an incredible life. Of course, as a kind of a minority, they did not have like the\nfull power of their full, you know, advantages of the rule. That's normal, but we had\nthis kind of a relationship before Israel was erected in 1948. And then, of course,\neverybody looked at Jews at the time as fifth column. And of course, the\nnationalistic regimes used that. And this is why what Biden\nsaid was very dangerous, when he said, \"If there's no Israel, no Jew in the world will feel safe.\" You are the leader of the free world. You are the president\nof the United States. Do you mean that you're telling me that Jews in your country, in the United States of\nAmerica are not safe? That is wrong on two levels. Number one, America,\nhistorically and right now, is more safe to Jews in\nthe world than anybody. They're safer than the Jews in Israel. They never had pogroms or\nthe Holocaust like Europe. They live here a good life, not perfect life, but they're better. Second of all, if you're the president and you're telling that a group\nof people will not feel safe unless there is a different one, you are already feeding\ninto their fifth column. Like, you're Russian, you come from there. And there is a group of laws\nin the Russian constitution that says that Russia will protect its citizens everywhere in the world. What happens if the president says like, \"Oh, you're Russians, you're\nprotected by own country. You don't belong here, this is terrible.\" - Yeah, you're right. That's\nactually an indirect threat. - Yes.\n- You know, even saying Muslims cannot\nfeel safe in America or something like this, that\nmeans like, that's a threat. - But what would a Jewish person in Beverly Hills or in\nBrooklyn feel if he hears that. You are already telling people you need to be loyal to Israel. I mean, Israel is a foreign country. I am sorry, but Israel\nis a foreign country. Israel is a client\ncountry that we sponsor. And it should actually be responsible and held accountable for what they do."

      "text": "- You mentioned 1948, the Nakba. But before that '41, '39,\n'41 to '45, the Holocaust. What do you do? What do\nyou do with the Holocaust? Like, how do you incorporate\ninto the calculus? - Oh, yeah.\n- Of what's- - Oh, it's terrible.\n- Of morality that leads up to the displacement of 700,000\nPalestinians from the land. How do you work that out? - It is terrible, but like, I mean, the systemic annihilation of\nJewish people under the Nazi. That is, like, a carefully\nengineered, thoughtful plan. It was terrible. It was kind of, like, the\nhuman ingenuity put into, like, something that is very evil. But also, it is not just that happened. We need to remember that Otto Frank, the father of Anne Frank, has his visa, refugee visa, rejected\nby the United States. There's a lot of people that were rejected by the United States, rejected\nby other European countries, and then they were pushed into Palestine. So you have to put yourself between like, and the Arabs say, \"Okay, we're\nsitting here, okay, come.\" And then, all right, you don't have a home or a country anymore. That kills you. I mean, you see, if I am not an Arab and you give me that\nkind of piece of, like, terrible human thrash, like,\noh, my God, that is terrible. But then I'm an Arab, it's\nlike, yes, I'm so sorry, but what do I have to do with that? Why is that my fault? The persecution of the\nJewish people have started since the eighth and ninth century, because they were first anti-Christians. They were, like, the criminal immigrants. They were, like, conspirators. This is the antis, like,\npeople, kind of, like, as if Europe kind of, like,\nthrow anti-Semitism on us. You understand that, like, Henry Ford, Henry Ford is one of the biggest anti. He was the inspiration\nfor Adolf Hitler. (laughs) This is how anti-Semitic Henry Ford was. And you kind of, like, gloss over that. And then suddenly, we, as Arabs,\nhave to pay the price, why? - Several questions I wanna ask there. But one just zooming out, why do you think hatred\nof Jews has been such a viral kind of idea\nthroughout human history? - Oh, it's very easy. It all started from Christ. They killed Christ, they killed Christ. They killed Christ, they're\nthe killer of Christ. - That's a very sexy story.\n- Yeah, and that stayed for years. That stayed for centuries,\nI'm sorry, centuries. They're the killer of Christ. And then the Catholic\nChurch did not allow usury, but they would work in usury. So they become rich. Now the people that we hate, that we accuse them of killing\nChrist are becoming rich. So that's envy now, and that's hatred. I mean, when you talk about ghettos, ghettos was not just as\nsecluded parts in cities. Sometimes those ghettos\nwere outside the cities. Jews were not even allowed\nto work a lot of professions. They were not allowed to get into the syndicates of\ncertain professions. So they had to go work\nusury and they got rich, so the people hated them more. The first crusade didn't\nkill a single Muslim. All they killed were Jews. And when they finally\narrived to Jerusalem, all they killed were Jews. They almost annihilated the Jews. So it was all this, and of\ncourse, you have the dark ages. Who do you need as an enemy? The Jews, right? They're the killer of Christ, there's nothing bigger than this. And then you fast forward, I mean, one of the things that I found out that was very, very, very, very crazy. When Henry Ford imported \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,\" by the way, in the Arab world, \"Protocols of the Elders\nof Zion\" is so popular. And for obvious reasons. (laughs) And for the people who don't know it, it's kind of, like, a\nbunch of, like, stories. And basically, it's like,\nthe Jews saying like, we gonna control the war. - Yeah.\n- Then, we're gonna do this, and we're gonna do that, and whatever. What people don't know, that\nthat is a work of plagiarism. It was plagiarized from\na satirical play called \"Conversation in Hell Between\nMachiavelli and Montesquieu.\" And it is kind of, like,\nbased on one chapter or one scene or so, it's crazy. - But it's crazy how sticky it is, like- - Yes, yes.\n- That's weird. - Because if I hate you, that's great. But if I have a story\nto support that hate, ah, that's even better. - But it's, like, one of the best stories, one of the stickiest stories about hate. - Of course.\n- It's probably the most effective, 'cause like, you know, a lot of peoples\nhate other groups of peoples, but that's just like the\nsexiest story of them all. - Because humans need to\nconcentrate their hate, their insecurities, and their\nshortcomings into one thing that they can practice that hate on. If it's a person, great. If it's a group, even better. - Right, how do you, into this calculus, incorporated that that\ngroup is pretty small? There's 16 million Jews worldwide. And you mentioned how is\nthat the responsibility of the Arab peoples, you know? Everybody should be to blame for not taking in Jews\nafter the Holocaust. But you know, the\nreality of the situation, if we look at the religious slice of this, there's 16, let's say, million Jews, and there's, I don't\nknow, how many Muslims, but 1.8 billion?\n- Yeah, yeah. That difference, that 100x difference, do you incorporate that into the sense that Jews in Israel\nmight feel for, you know, the existential dread that this small group might be destroyed? - Jews in Israel have\nevery right to feel afraid, because of everything that they see and everything they've\nbeen told, everything. But I would say that the calculus or the numbers doesn't like, of course, like, being small, it\nis, of course, a factor, but it is never an excuse in order to take something\nthat's not yours. It's saying like, \"Hey, you\nhave 300 million Americans and we have 52 states. Give one state, there's too\nmany of them, too many of you. Just give them something.\" You know, it's like, the\nfact that I have something and you don't, and\nthere are too many of me and there's little of you. And then you come in, and\nit's not really Israel against the Arab world or the Muslim, or because we have to say\nwe fucked up big time. But it is the Palestinians that are in and they are being subjected to that. So it's not really like the 1.8 billion and the 16 million Jews. And the 1.8 billion, if you look at them, some of them, like, don't care. Some of them live in two\nregimes, they're being oppressed. And those regimes are\nsupported by the United States in order, it's easier for me as an empire to take what I want from this country if I control the dictator. And I tell them that his\npower is linked to my ability, to my desire to keep him in power. So that's why you have a total disconnect between people in power in the Arab and the Muslim countries\nand the people themselves."

      "section": "1948",
      "text": "- Can you speak to 1948? You know, 'cause you mentioned\ntaking land that's not yours, maybe parallels with Native Americans. - Mm-hm, yeah.\n- There was a war, the Jewish minority fought that war against several Arab\nstates and won that war. How do we incorporate\nthat into the calculus? - Yeah, well, that's also a misconception, like, a misinterpretation of the event, because it seems that\nit was, like, the small, it's kind of, like, a David\nand Goliath kind of story. And I was always like,\n\"How did we not do that?\" But in reality, with numbers,\nI can't pull it up right now, but if you look at the\nnumbers, the number of tanks, the planes, the trained officer, because many of those Jewish fighters came from World War II, they\nwere seasoned fighters. And they actually had\nmore planes, more tanks, more artillery, more pieces of weapon, more of the all of other combined, because the people that\nreally, like, fought was Egypt. 1948, many of those Arab countries didn't even have their independence. So they would kind of,\nlike, send, like, a cavalry, or like, people in horses. But in fact, the whole idea was like, \"we won against seven nations.\" - Sure.\n- The numbers were totally in Israel favor. They were better equipped,\nthey were better trained. They had, like, more tanks\nand artillery and aeroplanes, and they planned better. So yes, they deserved the win, because they planned and we didn't. - So to you, there was an\nasymmetry military power even then?\n- Yeah. - But what do you do with the\nfact that the war was won? So like, if you look at\nthe history of the world, there is wars fought over land. - I agree with you, this has\nbeen the history of humanity. Humanity was not living peacefully. It's all about, like, people taking people and killing people, taking their land. But there's two difference here. Mostly, usually, the conquering power, like, for example,\nEngland, they had England, and they conquer you in India. And after the occupation\nfinished, they go back to England. France, Greece, Persia,\nEgypt, they will, like, go in, expand and shrink, expand and shrink. It's always been there. What is different here\nis exactly what happened in Australia and the United States. A group of people came in, not just to conquer and take the land, but to completely change, to replace them, and get them out or kill them. It was very easy with the Indians, because they had smallpox,\nthere was no social media. They did it over 400 years, they had time. The problem is what is\nhappening right now, I agree with you, it\nmight not be that new, but we are there and\nwe're watching it happen. - And so, now we have to\nconfront the realities of war and empire and conquering and- - Because, you know, what's the problem? We told ourself we can be better. - Yeah.\n- After 1948, there was the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. It means that we are\ngonna be better humans. We're not gonna kill and take land. We're not gonna displace people. We're not gonna take\npeople for what they have. There's now laws, there's\ninternational laws. There's international court of justice. And now, Israel is giving the\nmiddle finger to all of them. - So isn't it in some fundamental way, this whole thing that we're talking about is us as a civilization on social media, in articles and books and in newspapers, we're just trying to figure\nout who are we as a people. - I think the shock came from the fact that we thought that we\nas humanity have evolved. And now, what have actually changed is that we became more advanced in effectively eradicating\na group of people because of the technology that we have, and the fact that we can do that under the eyes and ears of all the world. And we are watching it on\nour phone, we have a window. We have a window to the war, you know? 1945, people didn't know\nwhat was happening in Japan. Well, we hear about it on the radio. Like, oh, today, our forces came in and they launched, I don't know. We don't know, we heard it. We maybe we saw pictures after\nthat, and it's quite edited. But now, we see it, we're into it. And it is so much for our\npsyche and we can get it. And the Arabs had said like, \"Guys, you told us, we came to the West because we were told that we were equal.\" You know the universal\ndeclaration of right? One of the co-authors, his\nname is Stephane Hessel. He's a Jew, he is a\nsurvivor of the Holocaust. And you know what happened to him? He died, by the way,\na couple of years ago, but before he died, he was\ncanceled by so many people, and he was called anti-Semitic, because he joined the BDS movement and he spoke about the truth of Palestine. That is the author of\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights that we value so much, and we think that that\nwould define our humanity. But then we go in and we are shocked. It's like, maybe we were sold something. Maybe that was false\nadvertisement. (laughs) - You shared a tweet by an\naccount called Awesome Jew. (Bassem laughs) It reads, \"Islamo-Nazi\ncomedian, Bassem Youssef,\" comedian in quotes, by the way. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of\ncourse, because I'm not funny. - So, Islamo-Nazi\ncomedian, Bassem Youssef, is now denying the October. I love that you retweeted\nthis, like, twice. - [Bassem] Yeah. - I guess suppose because it's advertising some\nupcoming dates. (chuckles) He's now denying October 7th massacre. The Muslim radical Bassem Youssef is notorious for his\nradical, radical said twice, for his radical hatred of Jews in Israel. In a recent clip, he claims\nthat the atrocities committed on October 7th are fabricated. We're looking for all information regarding any of his upcoming shows as well as the venues\nwhich host the scumbag. Would Jews feel safe around this Nazi? Nazi.\n- Yeah. - This is my first time\ninterviewing a Nazi. Big honor.\n- I know. It's my first time I\nactually get called a Nazi. - First time?\n- First time. I have been called so\nmany things in Egypt. So in Egypt, I was called a\nCIA operative, a Mossad spy, secret Muslim Brotherhood,\na secret Jew, secret Jew. There was also an article\nthat was published about me in the state-run media saying in details how Bassem has been\nrecruited by CIA agents using Jon Stewart in order to use satire to bring down the country. I was a free mason, an infidel, a member of the Knights of the\nTemple, something like that. And there's actually people, the Muslim Brotherhood on their show, they would say like,\n\"He's actually Israeli, and they have forged an\nEgyptian ID for him to come.\" So it's kind of, like, I said, I left all of that behind and I come here, it's like, boom, anti-Semitic Nazi. Damn! I mean, I really covered everything. I don't know what else. I mean, I think I have.\n- Yeah. - It's kind of, like, I'm collecting PhDs. I'm just, like, getting\nall of these credits. - How do you deal with that? How do you deal with the attacks? I mean, this goes back to the decision to do the interview with Piers Morgan. Like, how do you, like,\npsychologically through all of it? - These kind of attacks,\nat the beginning, it's fun, but when they evolve into something else, so for example, I was like laughing of all of the stuff about calling\nme this, calling me that. But then when people would\ncome and threat the theater, because it's not the people who\nare making those accusations that would come to you, it's\nthe people that will hear and see those accusations and act on it. And there's always the\nfear of like, I mean, we have in the Arab world a lot of things, like, somebody would hear\nsomething about someone else and go kill him and\nwhatever, like, anybody else. But somehow I wanna make fun of it. And to be called an Islamo-Nazi, it must been the funniest thing ever, because Islamo-Nazi, wow! How did you, and a radical Muslim, me? A lot of Islamists hate me.\n- Yeah. - They call me a secular infidel. (laughs) So it's kind of, like, who am I? Maybe I have an identity crisis and I need the people to tell me who I am."

      "section": "Egypt",
      "text": "- Well, let's go to the beginning. Let's go to your childhood. You grew up in Egypt, Cairo, Egypt. - My childhood. (laughs) - Well, let's figure out how\nyou came to be who you are. - How did you become an Islamo-Nazi? - Yeah, exactly. It's a long journey. I do like the swastika tattoo\non your ass, which I didn't- - How did you see my ass? (laughs) - You know what you did. - I know I didn't.\n- It was very inappropriate. You're also obviously a\nsexual harasser of me. - Is this is like a Me Too? - Yes.\n- This is like, 2020. Someone would come up, it's like, okay. - We have clip it. This is your Me Too moment. All right, so, Cairo,\nwhat's a defining memory, positive or negative, from your childhood? - My memory in general\nwas cool, it was cool. I went to a Catholic school until for primary school, the elementary. And by the time I'm done,\nthere was kind of, like, a start of a decline into\nthe public education. And my parents, they're like\nmiddle-class working officials. My dad was a judge, my mom\nwas a business professor. And they were, like, one\nof the people who's like, they didn't have that much luxury. My dad, like, drove, like,\na regular car, a Fiat, which is, like, the\nequivalent for the Lada, yeah. - [Lex] Thank you for\nspeaking to the audience. - [Bassem] Yeah, yeah, the Lada. - Well, so would that be\na good car or bad car? - No, no it's kind of, like, the minimum. And my dad was not, like,\na man of showing off. Whatever money they would do, they would put it for us, education, give everything to their kids. This is kind of, like, a\nvery, very typical mentality. And I'm sure it's in many cultures, but like, we grew up with this, like, everything that we\nhave is, like, for kids. So they will put us into education. So middle school, 1986 was\nthe beginning of the explosion of, like, international\nschools, private schools. And these schools were\nrelatively expensive. Of course, now with today's\ncurrency, it's ridiculous. But at that time, it's very expensive. So I went to that school. And there was this moment, it was like, you feel less right away. I mean, of course, there's the\nregular bullying and stuff, but it's not that, it's kind\nof, like, you always feel less. You don't have that much\nof, like, purchasing power that can allow you to\ngo to the same outings or travel with them. And even, like, how you dress, it will be modest compared to them. So I was always an outsider. And I compensated with that by two things, being good at school and\nbeing good at sports. So I was not, like, the typical nerd who was just like, that. I was playing football,\nbasketball, track and field. And I was like, one of the people would like to have me on their team. So, I wasn't like, kind of, like, \"Ah, he's a nerd, get him away.\" But I never had a girlfriend. I never had any kind of, like, I was not boyfriend material. So that's kind of, like, it leaves remnants in you\nthat you're not good enough. - But psychologically,\nyou're always, like, when you're by yourself,\nyou felt like an outsider. - Yes. All the time. And that's why it kind of,\nlike, I'm more of a loner. I don't have a lot of logical friends. I have acquaintances,\npeople that I do stuff with, but I don't have, like, the people that I tell them everything. When I went to medical school, now medical school is a different animal. Medical school is where all of the people from the public schools go. Public schools are very, like, they don't have English language\nas, like, a strong part. But they are brilliant people. So because they would\nmostly the study in Arabic, but they are brilliant and they are very, very,\nvery smart, very sharp. But then I'll go there,\nnow, I am the sissy boy from the private school that\ncomes into medical school. Now I'm an outsider again. And I go into residency\nand I pick up salsa. So now, I'm a salsa teacher while being a cardiothoracic\nsurgery resident. And I'm an outsider for the third time, because in salsa, I'm kind of,\nlike, the respectful doctor. And in resident, I'm the\nguy who is just dancing. And everything, of course,\nas a medical resident, you will mess up a lot. - Yeah.\n- So they would always like, \"Oh, because you're a dancer. Oh, because you don't care about medicine. You just, like, wanna go\nthere and dance with women.\" (both laugh) Which is true.\n- Yeah. (both laugh) And so all of my life, I\nfelt that I'm an outsider. I'm not part of the team, I'm\nnot part of the core group. And I have a story that you would love. Right before my residency,\nI was so much into salsa. So I had all of the money\nand then I saved that, and I was working summers\nand I was doing extra jobs. And I took that money and I went to Miami. - Yeah? Nice, yeah.\n- In order to learn Rueda de Casino, which is\nthe Cuban kind of, like, circle salsa kind of thing. And I went there in the summer of 2001. - Yeah.\n- And my return ticket was 9/12, 2001. (laughs) - The universe has a sense of humor, I gotta tell you that.\n- No, no, no. 9/12, I was supposed to be on\na plane coming back to Egypt. What happens? Thank God. I ran out of money 10 days before that. It's like, all right, I changed\nmy ticket and I came back. 9/11, I'm kind of like, huh. My mom, \"Wake up, wake up!\" What? What? And I see like the two\ntower falling, I was like. My mom's like, \"Oh, you're\nhere, you're here, you're here. Thank God, you're here.\"\n- Yeah. - And I was like, I could have\nbeen in Guantanamo right now. - [Lex] Yeah, flying at 9/12. - And by the way, I was\nin Miami, when they went to the flying school in Miami.\n- Yeah. - So, I mean.\n- Yeah. - I had, like, 9/11 written\nall over my face. (laughs) - [Lex] You'd be all over the news. - All over news.\n- Exactly. - And my mom was like, \"What,\nhe went there to dance salsa. I didn't know that salsa is\nlike a name for terrorist.\" - Why salsa, why did that attract you? And what, like, can you\nexplain what salsa is? So I mentioned to you offline that I've been doing a little bit of tango or trying to learn it. - Yeah, like, you know, samba,\nsalsa, bachata, merengue, it's kind of like Latin dances. And it's like, you know, I don't know how you describe salsa. Couple dance on Latin beat. - Yeah.\n- And I did it because once I, and I talk about that in my Arabic standup\ncomedy, not the English. I talk about, like, how I was, you know, I didn't have, like, really,\nlike, a great social life. And my friends went there one day, and then I go into a place,\nit was called El Gato Negro. No, no, it was called\nBig Fat Black Pussycat. And then I think they thought it will be, like, racist or something. So to change it to El Gato\nNegro, anyway, so. (laughs) - Great, great.\n- I know. - Great decision.\n- I know. So I went there, I was like,\n\"Damn, music and women.\" And I'm a doctor. A doctor dancing salsa,\nthat is a chick magnet. - [Lex] Yeah, 100%. - You know, we do everything for that. - All of human-\n- Even power, even money. - All the wars we've been talking about- - Women.\n- At the end of the day- - The approval from the other sex. We are babies, we are terrible people. - Yeah.\n- So of course, like, I mean, that was, like, great. But then as a nerd, I went in so hard, and now I became a salsa teacher. - Yeah.\n- And I earned more money from salsa more than I\ndid as a doctor. (laughs) - I didn't know this part\nof you, that's hilarious. - I know, I was making\nkilling amount of money, like, huge amount of money. And I was just like, you know, I would go finish my shift\nand I'd go to the salsa class. And sometimes, I would\nhave, like, 70 people in my salsa class.\n- Oh, wow. - I had like the biggest\nsalsa class in Egypt. - Wow!\n- In the beginning of the 2000, and it was fantastic. And it was an outlet, because you go there and there's the shifts and people dying. Damn, and you go, salsa. - [Lex] An escape, you\nmust have been good. - I was okay, I was cool. I was fun. There were people better than me. But I have a thing about\nteaching, I like teaching people. - So, you mentioned heart surgery. So what motivated you to become a doctor? - It was a choice of exclusion. I mean, there's nothing else you can do with these high grades other\nthan doctor and engineering. I hate math, so go be a doctor. (laughs) This is the Middle East,\nwhat do you expect? It's either, like, in my\njoke, in my show, I said like, it can be one of three\nthings in the Middle East, a doctor, an engineer,\nor a disappointment. That is the choices that you have. (both laugh) So years after, I'm a disappointment. (both laugh) Here I am. - You're damn good at it though. That's a hard path though. - Yes.\n- Right? And it's a fascinating one. - Can I tell you something?\n- Yes. - That actually I was thinking about, why did I actually go into medicine? And why did I always\nchoose the hardest thing although I didn't love it? And I have to tell you, I had an epiphany only two weeks ago. And I don't know if that's\nactually related or not. You know, remember, when I\ntold you I went to this school and I didn't have that much money, and I didn't have the luxury of time or money to be with those\npeople and do what they do. So by the time I finished school and everybody was going to university, everybody in my school went to the AUC, the American University in Cairo. Of course, private. Like, American education, party time. Like, I mean, of course, they're\nbrilliant and everything, but they have a different,\nyou know, social life. And part of me, now, I kind of, like, I realized that just\nlike very, very recently. Maybe I went to the hardest school ever so I don't have space to\nuse other than studying. Because if I have that much space, what I'm gonna do with it? I don't have that much freedom. I don't have that much money. I can't compete with\nthose people going out. So maybe I need a solid\nexcuse that I'm in a place where I don't have that\nmuch of a spare time. - Is it also possible, I like how this is a therapy session where we're a psychoanalyzing it. Is it also possible that\nyou always just pick the hardest thing you could possibly do? - Maybe, but- - Maybe that's the Piers Morgan thing too. - Maybe, but like when I\nleft Egypt and I came here, I still had the choice\nto go back to medicine. - Sure.\n- But I hated it. I hated it, medicine traumatized me. The amount of, like, you give up. You know, my brother in\nEgypt, he had a daughter. She's a brilliant basketball player. She is in the national team, amazing. I used to play basketball\nalso in the Egyptian league, but I was kind of, like, my favorite position in the\ncourt was the bench. (laughs) And I was not as good as her. And then it was time for\nher to go into college. - Yeah.\n- And he didn't talk to me for six weeks. I said, \"Tamer, what's happening\nto Farido, which college?\" Like, I didn't wanna tell\nyou, she went into medicine. I said, \"What, medicine? Why did he do?\" Because he knows how I hated it. - Yeah.\n- I was traumatized. And I said like, \"Dude,\nshe's a basketball player. Make her go like to an easy school.\" He's like, no, so that's kind of inspired. - You still did it, you still did it. - Yeah, I still did it, but I don't know. Is it because of the difficulty or because of what I told you? Maybe I needed something, maybe because I was not very\nconfident in my social life, so I needed a distraction not to have that much of a social life. - Oh, wow, okay. - You understand?\n- I see, yeah, uh-huh. - So, it's kind of, like, because I will always have\nan excuse I'm studying. I have something. I have exams.\n- Yeah. - And I don't know, I kind of, like, self-sabotaged my own thing, because I couldn't\ncompete with those people on the outing and the money and whatever, so I need an excuse to be as like, \"Oh, he's a doctor, he's studying.\" - At least in your own\nmind, you couldn't compete. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I always felt as less because, I mean, I didn't have any girlfriends in school. Like, I had very little in life. I had everything thrown\nto me came to life. So I always felt, even standup comedy, it came very late to me in life. So I always feel that I'm not good enough. I feel that I didn't spend the time to build the foundation\nthat other comedians do. So I always feel that I am too lucky. I always feel that this\nis a fleeting thing. And when I had the height\nand the fall in Egypt, when I would, like, the top of everything. I was, like, so famous, and then everything was taken from me. That's like, ah, you see. I told you that happens when you don't build foundation, you fall. - Yeah.\n- So I always feel that I am not good enough. Or if I am in a position\nwhere people think I am, deep inside, I am not. You know, that I have a speech impediment, that I was not meant to be a TV presenter? In Arabic, it's very obvious,\nI cannot roll my R's. I cannot say arr, I cannot roll it. So in Arabic, like\nSpanish, it's very obvious. So when I did my first\nvideo on the internet that made me famous, and then I got my television\ndeed back there in Egypt. My partner at the time, he took the video and\nhe went to a producer. He said like, \"Are you\ngiving me a guy with a lisp?\" That's why when I came on television, I was the first ever guy with a lisp. I had two things going for\nme, the lisp and the big nose. And I was always bullied\nfor these two all the time. So I always felt less. - See, but that's a foundation of, like, creating a great person. - Yeah, because if you're pretty, you don't need to do much. (both laugh) - I probably wouldn't recommend\nit, but it is true that- - So, if you are pretty, do some disfigurement\nat your face. (laughs) - Find the flaws and be extremely\nself-critical about them."

And at that time, CNN was\ncoming, like, on cable. And I was watching, and\nthere is this studio. I don't know what it is. So I put the earphones on\nand I started watching. And I was so taken by this\nthat I stopped the treadmill, and I just, like, stood\nfor 20 minutes like this on the treadmill, and I\njust, like, standing there. I didn't know what he was saying. I didn't understand what is\nDemocrats, what is Republicans, those names that he's saying. What is Fox News? I don't understand. But I was fascinated. There was something, you know, when you don't understand the\nmusic, but you get the rhythm? It was that. - I wonder what that is that you saw. It's like the timing of the humor. I mean, Jon Stewart is one of a kind, like, his biting criticism\nof power, I would say, and also ability to highlight\nthe absurdity of it all. - But you understand, I\ndidn't understand any of that, but I didn't understand\nany of the references. But it's the rhythm, the rhythm.\n- Yeah, the music of it. - You know, sometimes, when\nyou even see, like, a comedy that's a language you don't understand, but there's a rhythm.\n(imitates rhythmic beat) There's something, there's something in the music.\n- Yeah. - So there's something with the videos and the pictures, and he and\nthe face, and people reacting. - Yeah.\n- What is this, what is this? - Yeah, yeah.\n- What is this? And we had the global edition. So I went to the YouTube and I just, like,\nstarted to kind of, like, watch every single episode that I can. I said like, \"Do you think\nwe can have this in Egypt?\" They said, \"Nah, never.\" And then 2011, like,\nI had a friend of mine who was also a YouTube partner\nto something new at the time. He said like, \"Let's do\nsomething on internet. Let's do something.\" I said like, \"I wanna do Jon Stewart.\" It's like, ara ra ra, Do Ray William Johnson,\nJon Stewart will not work. I was like, \"Ah, I want\nto do Jon, that one.\" - Yeah, so that was in there? - Yeah, it was in there. And I did it, and it worked."

      "section": "Going viral during the Arab Spring",
      "text": "- Can you talk about 2011? I mean, what was it?\n- Yeah. - The Arab Spring, what is it? People here in America, you know? (laughs) - Depends on which side. - Did something happen or what? - Depends which side of\nthe equation you are. Because for a lot of\npeople, it's a conspiracy. It's American made, it is\nthe Muslim brotherhood. It's the Islamist, it is Israel. It is everything else other than people. Oh, but it's a pure revolution. I think we put too much\nweight on conspiracies. I think it is normal human\nbehavior that then become, get maybe used or abused or taken advantage of by other powers. And then the conspiracy starts. But at the time, the Arab\nSpring didn't start in Egypt. It started in Tunisia. Bouazizi's a fruit vendor,\nlike, burned himself up like, the American soldiers\nwho did that a few days ago, and that kind of sparked\nprotest in Tunisia. And Ben Ali was a dictator in Tunisia for about, like, 20 years,\nand they removed him. So suddenly, it was kind\nof, like, a domino effect. So then Egypt started,\nand it just took 18 days. And you know, people, hindsight\nis 2020, saying that like, you know, just Mubarak became, like, a burden on the military, because the military are the\nreal rulers of the country. You might have a president that kind of, like, have certain powers, but at the end of the day,\nwhen the military sees that a certain president is,\nlike, too much of a burden, too much of, like, a, you\nknow, so like they cut him off. - And Mubarak is the leader of Egypt at the time.\n- At the time. He was there for 30 years. - 30 years. By the way, speaking of which, 'cause it was a joke in\nyour Mark Twain speech. - Yeah.\n- I got teary-eyed just watching that. That was just great,\nyou're, like, fucking great. Like, what you did, the Mark\nTwain awards for Jon Stewart. It's great, I mean, your\ncomedy is great in general, and I wanted to go to your show. I definitely will. But that's, like, a little stroll on the complete tangent of\njust a masterful introduction and celebration of Jon Stewart. Anyway, Mubarak.\n- Yeah. - 30 years.\n- And it's the joke that I say also like, Mubarak, like, was a president for 30 years. Like, oh, my God, we had\na president for 30 years. Like, it's the Middle East,\nit's a very short first term. - Very short.\n- It's like, we're still warming up, baby. - Just Warming up.\n- And I told them like, we need to plan ahead.\n- Yeah. We need to plan our vacations,\nour careers, our jail time. It's just like we need to. (both laugh) - That's great, it's true. - So we had kind of like the shortest, nicest revolution. 18 days\n- Yeah. - And we thought, \"Oh, 18 days, we can change the country in 18 days.\" But of course, we were naive,\nand we had this kind of hope. So Mubarak was removed. There was an interim\nperiod by the military. Took it for one year,\nthen they did elections. Muslim Brotherhood came to power. They stayed for one year. And then the military removed them. And in these three years, my show started. It started by kind of,\nlike, a YouTube video. - It became famous overnight. - Overnight.\n- Yeah. - Five to six videos, boom, went out. And at that time, I was waiting to get my\nclearance to go to Cleveland. I was accepted in a fellowship\nas a pediatric heart surgery in a hospital in Cleveland. And I said, \"All right, I'm just gonna do a couple of videos. Maybe I'm gonna put in on internet. And maybe after a year or two, after I come back from the\nfellowship, somebody will come, \"Hey, why don't you write a show that looks like Jon Stewart.\" That was my mind. Took five weeks. I had my first contract of television. And overnight, the exposure. And over the next two, three years, I had 30 to 40 million people\nwatching every episode. A lot of this, like,\n\"Wow, that's too much.\" That is terrifying.\n- Yeah. - Because it means that\nthere are 30 million people who have an opinion about you. - Yeah, you said there's a lot of aspects of that sudden fame\nthat were just horrible. - It's toxic, it's toxic. It's unnatural, it's unnatural. When people started to\nrecognize me in the street and take pictures, I was awkward. It's like, why do you wanna\nhave a picture with me? Why? Because I didn't feel\nthat I'm worthy enough to be, like, a reward for\nsomeone to have a picture. And I didn't understand it. I was kind of an ass sometimes, because people thought it was arrogance. No, it was confusion. And I remember like, my\ndirector and my producers and people around, they always\nsaw me in a very bad mood. It's like, why are you not enjoying this? It's like, because this is not natural, this is not natural. This adoration, this love,\nand this have to end somehow. And it did. And because, at a certain\npoint, you are human. And people, kind of the\nadoration and the fun and the love comes, because\nthey see you saying stuff because you do your job basically. Political satire is\nbasically us making fun of politicians in the media.\n- Yeah. - And a lot of people have\na lot really strong opinions about politicians in the media. So we came there, we articulate that and we give it to 'em\nand we make 'em laugh. So for them, we made a great job. So why don't you do more? But you are limited. And at a certain time, you can't. And a certain time, you're\nafraid because we're humans. Because you're afraid about\nlike, if I continue speaking up, not like, something will happen\nto me, I'm kind of, like, maybe have some protection\nbecause people see me. But what the people around you? And I've seen that. So that's why, at a certain point, it's like, that's it, I can't. - I mean, there's a lot\nof things to say there, but one of the difficult things\nof fame in your situation is you're not just having\nfun, you're criticizing power. - Yeah, and it is loved by the people, but it comes with a price. Because at a certain, if\nthe power is too strong and you are not into a situation or a system that allows that, that gives you that kind of safety. - So, what happened? (Bassem giggles) - What happened. So the height of my fame, when the Muslim Brotherhood was in power. And at that time, they had\ntheir media and I had one show. I had, like, one-hour per week. And they had five channels, 24/7. And they were like, you know. Jon Stewart said it beautifully once. It's like, we say shit and you say shit, and we just say shit better than you. This is exactly what Jon Stewart was like. We're not better at\nsaying shit back at you. - Yeah.\n- So basically, I had one hour and they had, like, the five\nthing that they were like, you know, they're calling\nme all kind of names, not just me, like, all\ntheir enemies, you know? And then I just had one hour and I would kind of like\nannihilate them in one hour a week. So at a certain point,\nthey would even like, kind of be the side with the army against the kind of the liberal, seculars, whatever you call it. And at a certain point, the army kind of like flipped everybody. - What do you mean flipped? - Like, kind of, like, yeah, they removed the Muslim Brotherhood. They came to power. And I have to say, I admit it, I supported that in the beginning, because I had daily threats. I was actually interrogated and arrested under the Muslim Brotherhood. I was in an interrogation for six hours. And they were asking me\nall day about my jokes. And I used that in my standup comedy, describing exactly what happened in the six hours, and\nit is so funny. (laughs) - Okay, well, it is hilarious. Slow down. You were interrogated by\nthe Muslim Brotherhood. - The general prosecutor,\nthe general prosecutor. And it was based because of complaints by the officials and the government. Because in order the\ngeneral prosecutor to do it, it has to have a high up mandate to bring that person to questioning. - Oh, so they went through\nkind of official channels. - Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely. - It's all-\n- Yeah, it was official. It was legal, legal.\n- Okay, very legal. - So I went there and I asked, and it's kind of, like, a\nbunch of like, insulting Islam, insulting president,\nspreading false rumors. And I went there, and it was funny because I go into the building where there's police\nofficers and there judges, and all of them are big\nfans of the show. (chuckles) And some of them were\ntaking pictures of me. And then I'm sitting there, and it was the most\nridiculous interview ever, because he was asking me about my jokes. He's like, \"What did\nyou mean by this joke?\" And I was like, \"Nothing.\" (laughs) And it was there for six hours. - He's just reading your jokes back to you?\n- He was reading my joke, and he's reading the jokes, and the junior judge is sitting\nthere, like, cracking up. - Yeah.\n- He's like, \"Oh, I remember that.\" He's like, \"Guys, guys.\" (laughs) - That's dark. - It's kind of, like.\n- Yeah. - And I'm laughing, but in the same time, it's like, the whole\nsituation is ridiculous. But then at the end, I\nwas released on bail, so I went back to my show\nand I make fun of that. And you have to be honest, the Muslim Brotherhood were in power, but Egypt were, like,\nright out of the revolution for there was kind of like an equal spread of power between the people. There was not, like,\nsomeone who would come in and just like, the Muslim\nBrotherhood didn't have that power yet, but they were kind of, people saw that they\nwere moving towards that. And then the tension rose, and then there was, like,\na kind of a confrontation between them and the army, and then a lot of people\nwere killed in the street. It was terrible massacre. And then suddenly, I am\nblamed for all of that. It's like, \"You made fun of us, so now it made it easier\nfor people to kill us.\" It's like, \"Dude, come on,\nyou are doing that to me too. I just did it better than you.\" And the fact that you\nsided with the same people that flipped against\nyou, that's not my fault. - Did you criticize the army at all? - Yeah, so after that show, I did, like, one episode against the army and I was canceled the next day. And then I went to another channel, did 16 episodes in a different season. And I was walking on eggshells, and then that was canceled again. And then the production company that was doing my show\nthat we severed ties because we didn't have the show. They had their offices raided. They had people, like,\nhaving death threats. So I woke up one day,\n11th of November, 2014, and my lawyer said like,\n\"Leave the country right now. There is this legal case\nthat they kind of, like, they're coming for you.\" But I said like, \"You cannot.\" This was an arbitration case and I lost against the channel\nthat basically canceled me. And I said like, but there's\nno jail time in arbitration. He's like, \"Yeah, tell that\nto the judge, just leave.\" So I jumped on a plane. The verdict was 12 noon, 11 November, 5 afternoon, I was on a plane, left Egypt, and I never came back since then. - Was there a worry of non-legal\nthings like, assassination? - I can tell you something. I was so stressed because of the show and because of everything, sometimes, I would wake up in the morning and I hope that a bullet will\ncome and finish everything, because I was so stressed. It's like, I would love, because I'm too much of\na chicken to kill myself, so I would, like, rather have\nsomeone else do it for me. So I was so under so much pressure. And I remember the day that, like, my show was canceled indefinitely the second time under the army. And I was like, I don't\nhave to worry about what kind of script I\nhave to write next week, because you know, remember, when you asked me about, like, that tweet? But like, all of those said, those accusation doesn't bother me. Infidel, spy, secret Jew,\nZionist, Islamo-Nazi. That's bullshit. What really leaves a mark is the criticism to your craft and your work. So you're not funny, goes deeper. - Yeah, certain things get\nto you better than others, especially if you have,\nlike, a secret suspicion that you are, like, maybe not funny. - Maybe I'm not because\nI was put into that. It's like, because that\ntouched your insecurities like, I know, but you shouldn't say it out loud.\n- Yeah. (both laugh) - [Lex] You shouldn't\nsay the truth out loud. - You shouldn't say it out loud, like, keep it yourself. (laughs) - But what about the weight\nof the responsibility of speaking truth to power? Sort of, like, walking on eggshells. Like, what did that feel like? - Well, after the Muslim\nBrotherhood were removed, you have to understand, like, when the military coup happened,\nit was a very popular coup. Like, people love the army. In Egypt, the army is more\nsacred than the religion. People love the army,\nthe army can go no wrong. So me going against the army was, I mean, the Muslim Brotherhood\nwas not very popular. They were popular for their own basis, but people accepted the fact that, like, we make fun of them. But Sisi, at that time, he was a God. And I used to go to this\nhigh-class club called Gezira Club. And this is basically kind\nof upper middle class, upper class kind of people. And during that year of\nthe Muslim Brotherhood, I was the most popular ever. People come, yay! When the military came in,\npeople were walking to me, like, pointing their fingers like, \"Don't speak about Sisi. Don't speak about the army, huh? We love you now, but don't you.\" They were like that. So I called Jon Stewart. I was like, \"I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.\" And at that time, all of the channels,\nwere, like closed down. I was the only one left because\nit was difficult for them to get rid of me very quickly,\nbecause I was too popular. It was kind of, like, piecemealing. And I remember I told him like,\n\"I don't know what to do.\" He said like, \"You don't\nhave to do anything. Just your safety comes first.\" And I said, \"But I can't. I mean, I've been doing\nthat for two years, and I cannot just like\nsay, 'bye-bye, guys.' I have a responsibility, I have a team. I have people working for me.\" And I also, I cannot just like disappear. And he said the most\ninteresting thing ever. And said, \"If you're afraid of something, make fun about the fact\nthat you're afraid of it instead of talking about that something.\" - [Lex] Brilliant, yeah. - So there was like a whole episode that we did not even mention Sisi. We did not even mention it, but the videos did all the thing. And the whole episode was me trying to avoid talking about him. And that how the comedy was created. The fact that I don't wanna be here. So he said like, you will be surprised how people can relate to that, because there was a lot of kind of, like, \"Oh, we love him, but we\nfeel we cannot speak.\" So just by doing the simple thing about mirroring the society,\nthat goes a long way. And I kind of try to do what\nI can under the military. I mean, they came up with\na machine that treats AIDS and hepatitis C virus and\nbasically every single, and I went to town with that. Because people think, it\ndoesn't really have to go to the bigger post,\nlike, you're an asshole. No, you talk about their propaganda. You talk about what they want people to perceive them at, and it's a failure. And for that, that kind\nof hit them even more. Because what do authoritarian figures do? They work on two things,\nfear and propaganda. And from that, it gets the respect. So when you go into their\npropaganda and expose them, they have nothing else. - That's brilliant. So like, you are walking on eggshells, but you're doing it masterfully, that you're revealing sort of\nthe flaws in the propaganda, the absurdity of the propaganda in so doing or criticizing them. - And this is why comedy is very specific. Because people say, \"You\nwere not as hard on him as you were on the Muslim.\" I was like, \"Yes, because\non the Muslim Brotherhood, we were just, like, saying\nshit to each other.\" - Yeah.\n- But now, the ceiling was, like, here. So, it's kind of, like, how\ncan you do something from here? - Yeah, exactly. That's the art form. Yeah, in the Soviet Union under Stalin, a lot of the criticism came\nfrom, like, children stories and children's cartoons.\n- Yeah. Double meaning. - Yeah.\n- Double innuendo stuff that means other stuff. - Real crazy.\n- That's the brilliance. - Yeah, but everyone knows.\n- Everyone knows. - Because you are like,\nyou're mirroring the society. It's fascinating actually. - And that's why I was canceled twice. (both laugh) - And that is a scary one, the army. You see that in Ukraine. - Yeah.\n- Everybody supports the army. That's why Zelenskyy\ngetting rid of the head of the army was a big, big deal. It's a really dangerous thing, 'cause everyone's afraid\nto say anything negative about the army, especially\nduring war in that case. And in this case, maybe\nthere's a civil war, that kind of thing.\n- But think about it. Actually, an army during\npeace is much more dangerous. Because think about it, I don't really have an enemy to fight, but I have all of this\npower, all of this tank. Why is this actually\nhave more money than me? - Yeah.\n- I'm protecting him. Why does this businessman think that he can get onto his\nprivate plane and go to Paris? And why I'm here sitting like, not having all of these things? And there's a lot of time on your hand, because your job is to go fight. When you don't go fight and\nwhen you have the lack of, that's why that's one of the thing I love the United States about, is the fact that the army\ncannot really get power. But the kind of, like,\nthe power is actually in the military industrial complex, which is a different issue. - Yeah.\n- It's kind of, like, a different kind of issue. But if you have all of that power, like, why am I sitting around just, like, playing guard for you guys? - That's why Iran is terrifying, 'cause you have this military that it just becomes a\npolice force that turns against its own people.\n- Yeah, yeah. - So you're a famous guy talking shit in the middle of all that. - Yeah, and when I left, I\nwent through a very dark side. Dark, dark, dark, because\nall of the insecurities, all of the stuff that had been, like, working on my head now came to life. And now, I'm in America and I'm a nobody. - Yeah.\n- I'm a nobody. And now, it's like, I\nhave to do something. I have to earn some money. So I started to stand up\ncomedy five years ago. - Yeah.\n- And I sucked, because it was my second\nlanguage and I was new. And now, I would go to these\ncomedy clubs with, like, kids and 21, 22 people,\nand I'm there with a family to support, and I'm going\nthere to do it for $15, $20. And I was bad, I was bad. - You're bombing.\n- Bombing big time. - Eating shit.\n- Eating shit big time. Dying up there big time. And I would go back home and I would cry. And then what made it worse\nis sometimes like, a fan. - Yeah.\n- Like, not a fan. A bunch of fans from Egypt. Oh, Bassem Youssef, they come, it's like. (Lex laughs) - Yeah, just the-\n- The disappointment. That kind of, like, face of adoration. - Yeah, yeah.\n- Like, that goes into. (both laugh) And I could see it in their face. - Yeah.\n- I think he's gonna drive an Uber in a couple of weeks. (laughs) That kind of pressure. And I would go and I would cry, and then essentially, \"Oh, you left. You gave up, you were a\nsellout, you're a coward. Why don't you speak from\nabroad? You are safe now.\" I already spoke. I don't want to be, 'cause I\ndon't wanna be an activist. I was doing that for comedy\nwhen it was good for everybody. But now, they want me to go into YouTube and just like, throw rocks from outside. I was like, you do not\nunderstand I have family there. - Yeah.\n- And it was this kind of, like, thing, like, that I am being, like, attacked for not doing what I\nshould do in their face and attacked for not being\nfunny and not doing good. And now, I'm afraid\nlike, maybe it was wrong. And I didn't know, it was so traumatic that I don't know actually how\nI went through these years. And I blocked so many\ndetails from my brain, because I have been using\nthis technique for a while now that there is a lot of\nmemory gaps in my brain. And I'm trying to suppress it, because it was very, very, very traumatic. And a lot of people told me,\n\"You have to go to therapy.\" But I don't know, I'm worried\nto open the floodgates. And I'm thinking, as if as I'm functional and I'm not killing anybody, I'm okay. (both laugh) - I think Elon tweeted, \"Never Went to therapy is\ngonna be on my headstone.\" - Yeah. (both laugh) - So you're of best buds, okay. I mean, that is, like,\nterrifyingly difficult to like, after being a surgeon,\nafter being a superstar, super famous, going to eat\nshit at local tiny clubs in the United States. I mean, eating shit, period.\n- Yeah. - Like, bombing is really,\nreally, really difficult, really difficult for 20-year olds. - Imagine when you're 45, 46, and then people's like, \"Is\nthis his midlife crisis? What is the...\" (both laugh) I went through a lot of\npain and a lot of, like, the doubts, and it was terrible. - I mean, how did you survive? I mean, I know you blocked off most of it, but what gave you, like,\nstrength through all that? - Because I didn't have any other choice. Because I started that, and the only reason that\nI could is continue. I don't know what else to do. I don't wanna go back to medicine. I don't want to do that. And I don't know, and\nbit by bit, bit by bit, I started to kind of, like, be\nbetter, be better, be better. And I was at a certain time,\na year ago, a year ago, this is where I started to kind of, like, hone the craft and kind\nof sell more tickets, and sometimes even sell out some shows, and sometimes sell a theater. So like, it was going, and the money was flowing and it was good. And then I was like, I want\nit faster. I want it more. I want it now. I want\nNetflix deal, and whatever. And then the Piers Morgan thing happened, and then I blew up. And then suddenly I'm\nselling out to everywhere. And it's like, \"Ah, if those people came, if the war happened two years\nago, I will not be ready.\" So now, they come to the\nshow, and by the way, my show had nothing to\ndo with the October 7th. My show is my thing that I've\nbeen crafting and working on. You know how difficult\nit's to do the first hour, the hour that I've been\nworking on for five years. And it's all my personal story, all about like, what\nhappened to me in Egypt, me as an immigrant, coming\nhere to the United States, finding Trump as a president, finding myself in the\nmiddle of a guns rally, finding myself in the middle of a bombing. Kind of, like, talking about\nhow I got my citizenship. It's like, funny stories\nabout, like, my origin story. So they come in and they\nexpect me to October 7th, and all they see is my personal story. But it's good, and it\nkills and they love it. It's like, if that kind of,\nlike, blew up in America, happened to me two, three years ago, people would come and be disappointed. - I gotta say the timing of\nOctober 7th is very suspicious. - Oh, my God. Please don't say that. - I don't know. I'm just asking questions, I don't know. - I'm telling you, one\nof the funniest thing. A guy, I was in Dubai and\nlike a TV anchor came to me. \"Bassem Youssef, he flourishes\nduring revolutions and war.\" I was like, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, what? Dude! You're making me sound like\na bad omen, a very bad omen.\" - Yeah, you, Hamas, and Bibi together orchestrated all of this.\n- Oh, my god. That's the trilogy. (laughs) - You guys should go on the road together. I'm telling you that phone call is coming. - Yeah, but Hamas has to open. (both laugh) - And that would really bomb, right? - That would really bomb. (both laugh) - Oh, I love dark humor. You do a show, like, you were saying, in English and in Arabic."

      "section": "Arabic vs English",
      "text": "And the story is very different. - Totally different,\ntwo different stories. - I would love to just\nthe language difference, because it's the music of the\nlanguage is also different. So like, how can you\nconvert it into words? But what's the difference in\nthe music of the languages? - I'll tell you, because\nI thought about a thought. (both laugh) - All right, all right, all right. - Okay, so, when I was\ndoing the English first. - Yeah.\n- I actually had good jokes, but I was missing the\ndelivery, because the cadence and the music and the rhythm is different. The way that an English speaking Americans member of audience will receive it, it will be different\nthan how I receive it, the energy, everything's different. So when I kind of, like, got it, I didn't know how to\nswitch back to Arabic. - Oh, wow, yeah, fascinating. - Because here's the thing, with English stand up comedy, you have a huge library,\nyou have, like, a legacy. You have, like, years and years and years and years of people doing comedy. But in Arabic, it's very new to us. And most of the Arabic standup comedy, especially in Egypt, is very tamed. This is kind of, like, imagine\nthe standup comedy scene in American 1960s before Lenny Bruce. - Oh, so no swearing, conservative, careful.\n- No swearing, nothing. Conservative, everything\nkind of, like, not yet. It's kind of like very... So I didn't know what to do there. So I broke the barriers. I became Lenny Bruce,\nI became George Carlin. So I went in and I\nchanged the whole thing. - Seven words you're not allowed to say. - For me, they're 15 words. (both laugh) - That's a lot.\n- A lot. Arabic is a very rich language. - [Lex] Yeah. - So when I did, here's the difference between the Arabic and the English show. The English show, surprise, surprise, is a unifying language\neven for a group of Arabs. So if I give the same exact show to the same 1,000 audience\nmembers in the same theater, and they're the same people, same makeup of, like, Lebanese,\nEgyptian, Syrian, Saudis, English will be a unifying language. Arabic is a dividing language. - Why is that?\n- Because you have 22 dialects and the dialects are vastly different. And like, maybe Egyptians understand a little bit of Lebanese,\nbut not that much. But the reference is\nAlgerian, Moroccan, Tunisian, totally different animal. That's like a totally different language. Saudi, Emirati, Kuwaiti,\ntotally different. People understand the Egyptian dialect, because it's the dialect of most of the artwork and the movies. But the reference in\nthe everyday street talk might not be understood by them. So now, I have to go in and talk to all of\nthese dialects together. So I formed my big part\nof my show is like, what are you guys expecting of this? When I go do profanity\nand you're gonna like it, this is the problem with\nthat, the show as a dialect, and I construct all of these sentences formed of so different, different words. For example, an iron in any\nArab dialect is an iron. In Saudi Arabia, it means ass. That's one example.\n- Yeah. - That's one example, you know? So imagine if you can\nactually construct sentences having all of these things in one set. So I would construct, like, a whole section of my show about that. - So it's really very much about, like, self-reflective on language and the limits of language that's allowed. - And the limits of language, and I tell them part of the show is like, I know what's the problem\nwith me doing Arabic. It's like, if this was an English show and I was telling you\nfucking shit and bitch, you'll be, ha-ha-ha. But if I do one swear word,\nall of you will scream. - [Lex] Yeah. - It's like, why?\n- That is fascinating. - Is it because we are ashamed? - Yeah.\n- So it's kind of, like, it's not just, like, about\nswearing, it's about like, there's a lot of philosophical\npathways in this. Yeah, there is profanity, and people have fun, whatever, but like, it is about, like,\nhow do we treat our language? And I tell them, we speak Arabic as Arabs, but it's not the same Arabic. It's crazy, right? - And you're doing the\nshow in America also, which is another level of- - Oh, yeah, actually, the\nArab diaspora in America is some of the best audiences I have. They are, like, wonderful. And I did it also in the Middle East. And maybe I'll do, like, an Arab tour in the Middle East in the fall. - Which countries would you go to and not? - I already did Jordan, Lebanon. I'm doing UAE, I'm doing Kuwait. - Egypt?\n- Bahrain. Egypt, I don't think so. I don't think so. - Is it personal? Is it\nworry about your safety? - Well, I have the American\ncitizenship right now, so I am relatively safe. There is a block.\n- Sure. - Honestly, there's a block.\n- Yeah. - There's so much that happened. And I will never badmouth Egypt. This is my country. Like, it has all of my memories, 40 years of my life I lived there. But when you get hurt so much,\ninstead of trying to kind of, I don't wanna take revenge,\nI don't wanna, like, battle. I just want to avoid, because\nEgypt gave me so much fame and so much love and so much\nhate and so much rejection. It was a very tumultuous relationship. Very, very difficult. And a lot of people tell me,\n\"Well, don't you miss Egypt?\" And I tell them every time, the Egypt that I miss\nis not there anymore. It's not bad or good,\nit's not worse or better. It's just I'm different. And the places are different\nand the people are different and their circumstances are different. Whatever image that you have of what you love is not there anymore. That's why a lot of immigrants,\nespecially Arab immigrants, they live here, but they're there. And then when they go back for a vacation, they get disappointed, because they didn't find what they want. And then they come back here\nand they're disappointed, because this is they wanna come back, but it's not there anymore. - Yeah, their view of that\nplace is from a different time. You know, my parents, but everybody that left the Soviet Union, I mean, it's such a complicated\nrelationship with that. It sometimes borders on\nhate, disappointment. In the case of the Soviet\nUnion, perhaps similar to Egypt, is the promises sold when you were younger and the promises broken by the possibility of what it was supposed to be. With the Soviet Union, I'm\nsure with Egypt it's the same. Iran is the same. So they have a very complicated\nrelationship with that. - Yeah, this is why, like, for example, people from Iran, you know, I remember. I remember quite well the World Cup that was done in the United States. And the Iranian team\nwere playing in America. And they were people in the\naudience all wearing Iran. They hate the regime, but they\nhave this kind of connection with the country.\n- Yeah, yeah. - And this is the whole thing. You can actually love the country and you not have to agree with the regime. - Would you ever perform in the West Bank? - No.\n- Gaza? - Because if I go there, I have to go through\nthe Israeli checkpoints, and I don't wanna go through the Israeli. I don't want to have an Israeli soldier telling me what to do. - Yeah, there's a demeaning\naspect to that whole. - Very.\n- Even in subtle ways, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. I mean, I have so many Palestinian friends with an American passport,\nUS passports, living here. They're born here, and they\ntalk about the humiliation and the intimidation and the\nharassment that they go in. It's like, do you want me to try? - Yeah, that little bit of a humiliation. - A little bit. - Oh, sometimes, it's major. - I know, I know.\n- But I noticed that, you know, even the little bit\nhas, after a lifetime of that, it can turn to hate towards the other. - [Bassem] Yeah, and resentment. - Resentment, and then how do you do anything\nwith that resentment? - I have a friend of mine, he is from Palestine, from the West Bank. He's American here, he is born here. And we talk about, you know, we have, of course, all of this\ndiscussion of what happened. And he tells me, you\nknow, in October 11th, in the West Bank, and there\nwas a village called Qusra. And on that village, like, the settlers went\nin around the village and they send a message on Facebook. It was like, \"You rats,\nget out of your sewers and we're gonna be waiting for you.\" Intimidation through technology. And then, Qusra have,\nlike, another settlement next to it called Esh Kodesh. Esh Kodesh, they have people there who were training something\ncalled (speaks in Arabic), Which is basically the guardians of Isha. And it's like a paramilitary group that trains other settlers\non military combat, give them weapons and do,\nlike, military drills. And they went there, like,\nmilitarized and went there, and it was actually co-founded\nby a Jew from Brooklyn, not even, like, an Israeli. And he's, like, one of the\ndisciples of Meir Kahane. I'm sure that you know who Meir Kahane is, who was a Jewish defense lead. The people who assassinated Alex Odeh here in the United States. And they were there with\ntheir weapons outside intimidating people. This story carries everything that is wrong with the situation. You have people from\nBrooklyn, from outside, just because they're Jewish, they can come and they can claim the\nland from the people there. Anybody from (indistinct), just because he's Jewish, you can come and take the\nland from other people. They're using technology\nto intimidate Palestinians. They have unchecked military power. These are not IDF soldiers,\nthese are settlers. And they have free reign\nin order to intimidate and to kill the people. And you understand, this is\nthe daily life of Palestinians, not in Gaza, in the West Bank. - What do we do, what do people do to nudge this towards\npeace, towards flourishing? - Here's the thing, I wanna\ntalk to the people of Israel. What is Israel doing right now is not just unfair to the Palestinians, it's unfair to the\nJewish people in Israel. No, it is unfair to the Jewish\npeople around the world, because the way that Israel\nlinks itself to the Judaism, at a certain point, you know, remember like Isis and Al-Qaeda and when everybody hated Muslims? You know, sometime, humans are simple. They cannot have the nuances to separate. So anybody who with a Muslim name, with a Muslim face, with\na beard or looks Muslim, he would do it because of that\nactions of those atrocities. You have the power as a\nperson to separate yourself from an abusive power, a\nhorrible power and be yourself. I am really worried because\nthe rise of antisemitism and the rise of hate against Jews is not because of the Jews. It's because of the\nactions of a government. Jews do not have to be\non the side of apartheid. Ronnie Kasrils, he is\na Jewish South African, and he fought shoulder to\nshoulder next to Nelson Mandela. He was part of the African\nNational Conference, ANC. And he had an article say like,\n\"I know what apartheid is, and I saw Israel and\nthis is what they have.\" And the thing is that Israeli government should listen to other people. You cannot call anybody who criticize you either an anti-Semite, or\nif they're already Jewish, you call them, like, self-hating Jew. You cannot do that, you\ncannot continue doing that. When I would go in and criticize\nthe Islamist, it was like, \"Oh, you're self-hating Muslim. You're not really Muslim. You're an infidel, you're secret, you're a secular, whatever.\" We have the power in\norder to reform the course by holding people in power accountable. And the thing is, it is very stupid to actually call this antisemitism. And like, my idol is Jon Stewart. I voted for Bernie Sanders. (laughs) Sara Taksler, the one who\ndid this amazing documentary about me, \"Tickling Giants,\" she's a Jew. She's married to an Israeli Jew. We have a good ratio because\nwe know what the right is. They don't have to associate themselves with the action of the Israeli government."

      "section": "Sam Harris and Jihad",
      "text": "- One of your favorite words, jihad. (Bassem laughs) - That's my favorite hobbies. - It's his favorite hobby.\n- It's in my shows. Like, what's his favorite? It's that I talk about like, how when a white shooter does something, he talks about all of his family. And I'm always like, what if we did this,\nlike, for Arab terrorists? What are his hobbies? Jihad. (both laugh) You see, you could be a comedian. - Yeah, wow! You're making me feel good, okay. Sam Harris has done\nseveral episodes on jihad, and people should go listen to it, even if you disagree with it. But the basic idea that he's\nproposing is that this idea of jihad, in a negative\nconnotation of it, of martyrdom, is the thing that gets\nis counterproductive, is destructive to the\npossible future flourishing of Palestinian people. What do you think of that? There's just the idea of martyr- - Yeah, I totally agree, but like, people don't\nwake up in the morning and say like, I wanted to clear jihad. Think about it. Why would anybody choose to end his life by taking other people\nwith him and end that life? His life must be miserable,\nhe must be pushed into that. Nobody chooses death over life willingly. One of the first suicide bombers in the Palestinian\nresistance were Christians. We don't talk about that. - I think he would say that\nthe presence of a story that you can tell yourself when you're in a really shitty place, that you can go to a much better place. - Yeah.\n- By sacrificing your own life, just the\nfact that the presence of that story is there is harmful. - Of course. But here's my problem with Sam Harris. And usually, people will,\nthey have free range talking about the Islamic faith\nand nitpicking the stuff that makes it put in a bad light. I can go and nitpick\nevery single religion. There are Jews there that been here who openly say spitting on\nChristians is not a hate speech. All right? I mean, you can bring me,\nlike, all kind of videos of Islamic Jihadists saying\nhorrible things on YouTube, and I can bring you Jews who live there. They say like, \"We gonna\nhave the whole world enslaved for us and everybody would\nlove to be slave for the Jews.\" You know, I can use the Talmudic argument that if you tie a man to a tree and he dies of thirst and hunger, you didn't kill that man. And this is kind of the\nsame arguments like, \"Ah, we not killing Palestinians. It's just like killing man, and they were dying by\nthemselves,\" you know? So the nitpicking of a certain narrative, religious narrative, that is separate from the political context and\nwhat's happening right now, it's very unfair, because I can read. If you wanna have a deep\ndive into religious texts, nobody will be happy. And I can bring stuff from the Talmud and the Torah and stuff that is horrible. But like, you know, this is a way again of, like, distraction. - I dare you to talk about\nBuddhism and Jainism though. Try.\n- Well, you know, the people who killed\nthe Muslims in Myanmar, weren't they Buddhist?\n- Yeah. Well, let's go Jain. Okay, I'll find a little bit. I got to get back to you.\nI'll have to find the- - The flying monster. The Church of the Flying\nMonster is spaghetti. (laughs) - As a person who tries not to eat carbs, I'm deeply offended by that. - I mean, there's Scientologists, all they do is actually buy real estate. (both laugh) - I think there's a few books written about the fact that they\ndo other stuff as well. (Bassem laughs) So even there.\n- I know, I know. - Mormon, sometimes, they're some of the nicest\npeople I've ever met. - Yeah.\n- But I'm sure there's also darkness there too. Oh, boy, religion. - There's soaking in Mormon. - There's what?\n- Soaking. - What's soaking?\n- Okay. So soaking basically, like,\nif you get into the woman and you don't move, that's not adultery. That's not like... - Oh, interesting. So- - [Bassem] Yeah, you go\nin and you just stay. - There's a loophole. - There are loophole, that's\nthe thing about religion. There's a loophole.\n- Religion has a loophole. - Yes, and Muslims, we\ndo that the whole time. We pick and choose our sins,\nthe stuff that we enjoy. It's just, we are humans. - 72 versions waiting for all of us. - Maybe if I converted you\nas a Jew, I'll get you 80. I don't know, you know,\nlike, we can negotiate. - Right, but I also have\nquestions about whether- - It will be a very good deal. I'll give you, and maybe\nI'll throw there a Camry. - I have to honest,\nCamry, it's pretty good. What year? I don't know. - 1998.\n- All right. - Best year ever. (laughs) - Well, they last a long time.\n- Yeah. - So, I'm not sure I want '78, '72. - I'll throw five in the\nmix and see how we feel. - Yeah. Can we-\n- If you wanna upgrade. - [Lex] Can we do a trial period? But in general, if you just zoom out,"

      "text": "do you think religion, in what way, is it good for the world\nand what way is it harmful? - If there was no religion, humans would have invented religion. Because think of, like,\nthe early humanity. Like, you are, like,\na caveman or whatever. And then, like, you see\nyour family members killed, and then you say, like, what? I'm gonna be like the sheep or the gazelle that just, like, ends in perish. I am more important. I think with the development\nof consciousness, humans, like, thought that\nthey are much more precious and important than the other animals, because they have now intelligence. So my life will not end like that. Death will be even more important. There's consequences for that. There's consequences for what I do. And then the early man was\nlike, they're in the desert and all of these, like,\nnatural phenomenon. They didn't know what\nto do, they were afraid. So they need to have refuge. They need to have\nsomething to take care of. They need to have a reason for everything. Because if there's no reason,\nit's chaos, it's chaos. - It's terrifying.\n- It's terrifying. It's terrifying, there's nothing. There has to be a reason. There has to be a reason,\nthere has to be a purpose. There has to be, like, a cause, something. I'm not just gonna be like, die like a cockroach being stepped on. And that's kind of,\nlike, part of it is ego. - The whole world rotates\naround you in a way. - It's the ego. So religion actually got a lot\nof it from humanity itself. Like, me, us, like, us being humans. And many religion is a\ncollection of stories. And those stories based on things that humans did themselves and\nthey attributed it to gods. - And there's an aspect of religion where you humble yourself before a thing that is much greater than you. So that has a, I would say, a very positive effect of humbling. - It will be great if it stopped there. - Yeah.\n- But here's the thing, if you humble in order\nthat your ego kicks in and feel that you are\nbetter than someone else who's not humble in front of the same God. - Don't go there. - That means that I will\nhave all of that trait that I can use that because now, what does mean being humble? I'm divine.\n- Yeah. So I'm way more humble than you. - Ah, but you're not. So you see how they kind\nof, like, the oxymoron. I'm humble and I'm surrendering,\nbut in the same time, I am better than you\nand I'm more entitled. Isn't it crazy? - Yeah, it's beautiful,\nit's crazy, absurd. - Look at like the Muslim,\nChristians and Jews and every like, it's like, \"All right, Muslims, we surrender.\" I mean, I'm talking\nabout the extreme ones. I mean, like people. So, I surrender to God,\ngood. Keep it that way. - Yeah.\n- Like, if you go there, I surrender to God, that\nmeans that I am closer to God, then you should die! - Yeah.\n- Okay, Christians. Christ is love and he loves\nme and we gonna be together, but you don't get into\nhis kingdom and you die. You see, it is the same thing. - [Lex] Yeah. Yeah. - It's just, if you-\n- Just stop it. - Like, stop there. Stop where you are humble and you feel that you're a piece of shit. - Yeah.\n- And you are worthless human being and you are there. - Yeah, yeah.\n- Stop there. But once you says like, oh, that makes me a\nbetter person than you, and it makes me more with God than you. So that would give me the\nentitlement to kick your ass. - Yeah, we always ruin a good thing. - Don't we? (both chuckling) - That ego. You've been outspoken, you\nknow, with Piers Morgan, but just on this topic, and you talked about the Superman story. Which I would love it if you\nwere in a Superman movie. But have you lost job\nopportunities because of this, because of speaking up? - There was a couple of things that were going on, but they stopped. Again, I don't know if October 7th. - The Superman story, just so- - Yeah, yeah.\n- So what role were you? - Okay.\n- What did you audition for? - Yeah, okay, okay, all right,\nall right, okay. (laughs) So in June, I was traveling to Dubai. And right an hour before I\nget into the car and go there, my manager is like, \"Bassem,\nI'm gonna send you a script. Read it, it's for Superman.\" It's like, oh, Superman, you know, I'm not really good in auditions.\nI'm not a seasoned actor. So I was like, \"Okay, I'm just\ngonna do it, send the tape.\" I do the tape, I send\nit, I go to the airport. And I think I can talk about it now, because they said they changed the script. So basically, what I found it interesting in that new script is that there is, like, a dictator in a country that\ninvades another country, and Superman interferes politically. That's the first time we ever see Superman\ninterferes politically. - Yeah.\n- So basically, it was like Russia and Ukraine. But because of me, it couldn't\nbe Russia and Ukraine. So it had to be something\nkind of, like, with a flavor. So I read the role as if as a\nmixture of Trump and Mubarak. (Lex laughs) I did this mix of, like, you know? I have, like, the kind of the Middle East. - Yeah.\n- But also like, kind of, like, the essence of Trump into it. I went to the airport, it's like an hour. It's like, James Gunn saw it, he loves it. What? I never had an audition that fast. I mean, I had a few roles, but\nnot that fast, not like that. And then I said like, well, the strike starts, like, tomorrow and we need to be on the phone. But after the strike, we cannot\ntalk, the SAG after strike, like, where the writers\nand the actors strike. So like, well, I'm gonna\nbe on a plane right now. He's like, \"Okay, once you land, you can have a Zoom call with James Gunn.\" I have a call with James Gunn. I'm a huge fan of him. The guy took, like, something like, \"Guardian of the Galaxy,\" nobody knew about it,\nmade amazing trilogy. And he is, like, a really cool guy. I like what he did. And it was like, really nice. And he started to talk\nto me about the movie. And you know, like, I talk to\npeople before casting them. So I know that everybody's\non set have a good chemistry. It was amazing. So in your mind, if you're an\nactor, what does that mean? You got the part, and he\ntold me, \"You got the part.\" Month goes by, strike goes\nby, October 7th happens. I do Piers Morgan, one and two, and then I go to my Australian tour. My manager called me,\n\"Bassem, the strike was over.\" He's like, \"You don't\nhave the part anymore.\" I was sad, very sad, but for three days. And I said like, I need to\nstand up with it, khalas. I'm actually doing very\nwell. (speaks in Arabic) And then when I went to Chris Cuomo, after I finished the show, he told me, \"Did you lose any opportunities?\" And that was off record, after the show was, like, we concluded. And I said, I talked about Superman, and I found myself when I\nwas talking, I was angry. - Yeah.\n- I was bitter, and I went home. I was like, \"Why was I\nangry? Why was I bitter? It wasn't meant to be. And\nI'm living a good life now. I don't need to\" So when I was asked again the next day in two different interviews, the BBC and another one was\nalong with my friend Dino, I said the story in a different way. I said, \"I don't have any anger. As a matter of fact, maybe\nif I was Warner Brothers,\" I didn't talk about James Gunn,\nI thought it was the studio. \"If I was Warner Brothers\nand I'm a Muslim, I wouldn't have, like, a Zionist or a pro-Israeli in my movie. But I want to tell them that like, when I criticize Israel, I am\nnot a threat to you as a Jew. And we can actually have more in common.\" I was more of a kind of empathic. So when I said that,\nthe internet went crazy. And you know, James Gunn have haters because, you know, the\nSnyderVerse and all of the, it's a word that I don't understand. And James Gunn, like, had\nall of these attacks on him. And I was pissed of how it was handled. I wasn't angry at James\nGunn, but I thought it was. So my publicist now mentions like, \"Bassem, stay calm, don't speak. It's better to, like, not talk about it.\" I said, okay. So there's nothing wrong about me, but I see the heat is\nrising against James Gunn. And that is a guy that I\nhad a personal connection even through Zoom, and I\ndidn't like what was happening. And then he called me\nand he explained to me. He says, \"Bassem, you\nknow, I actually use like, have camera tests before\npeople before finally\" I didn't know that. \"And then we changed the\nscript and it was the strike. So I didn't call.\" And also I thought to myself,\nI'm small, I'm a small actor. I'm not that important for him to call me to say we're gonna change the script. So I still think that, like, the timing sucks and everything. But then I went and I did a video explaining exactly what I'm telling you, because I didn't want to be famous for the wrong reasons.\n- Yeah. - Because that will be unfair. Because already, and I was\nhaving like interviews, \"Can you comment about Superman?\" I was like, \"Guys, that's it. I'm not gonna talk about it,\nbecause this is a non-issue.\" And when I talked to James on the phone, I felt how sincere he was. So I didn't want someone\nto, because of me, will have that kind of attack, because I know what it means\nto be on the other side of that kind of attack. It's terrible, and it ruins\nyour life and it ruins your day. And nobody deserves to be doing that. And I don't wanna be the reason for someone else to go through that pain. - And you also said that\nyou don't wanna be a victim. - Yeah, I don't want\nto be. I'm doing great. I'm selling out everywhere. I'm having a wonderful,\nloyal audiences coming to me. Why I would be angry about\nthe role of a Superman? Yes, it's great to be\nin the superhero movies, but so what, you know? - Wait, you know,\nthere's a wisdom in that. Even if you weren't doing great, that's a choice a lot\nof people can come to, which is like, do I\nplay victim here or not? - It's greed, it's greed. They want more attention. They want to be more into the thing. They want more and more, and there's so much to go around to be enough for all of us. But it is greed. It is ego, ego, ego, ego. I need to be in the center,\nI need to be victimized. I need people feel sorry\nfor me and love me. And it is not the right way. It is not, because it is fake. It is fake, it's made up. And I did not victimize\nmyself when I left for Egypt. I mean, now, I speak about it now. But in that dark times, I\nwas detained in airports. I didn't have my American passport yet. I was still traveling\nwith my Egyptian passport, and I was detained in an Arab airport. And I was going to be\ndelivered to the Egyptians. I had shows when I was still starting, I had hecklers being sent to\nme by the Egyptian embassy and Egyptian consulate\nin New York and in London to curse me and to take videos of that and then send it to\nstate-run media in Egypt. And I didn't speak about that, because I felt that, like,\nif I speak about that, I feel about like, what\nwas going on to me, I would be victimizing myself. It's like, if I'm gonna be good, I'm gonna good, because of what I do, not because of what people's perception of what I'm going through. - Yeah, and that becomes a slippery slope. And somehow victimizing yourself- - Goes to more victimizing.\n- Yeah. - And then you cannot leave that habit. You can only exist and thrive\nif people feel sorry for you. - Yeah, I mean, Israel\nand Palestine currently both have that temptation. - I would always push back\nwhen you do the comparison, because one of them is not\nreally in the same kind of power. I mean, yeah.\n- For sure, for sure. - So like, do you get the- - I mean, it is very easy to say why Palestinian will victimize themselves. But Israel, with all\nof that military might, man, it's too much. What Israel is doing is that they're victimizing the Jewish experience. And I don't think it is\nfair for a lot of Jews. I don't think that they\nshould use the Holocaust and the persecution that happened to Jewish people all through history in order to push an\nequally oppressive agenda. That is not fair, and it's not good for\nthe Jewish people living. And it is basically a disrespect to the memory of the Holocaust. I told you I wanna make a movie\nabout the Holocaust, I do. Because what happened was that kind of engineered torture\nshould never happen again. And it should not be happening now. - So to you, what Israel\nis doing is leading to more antisemitism in the world? - A 100%, and I think, and I know, can I be a conspiracy\ntheorist for a second? - Please, the earth is\nflat, we all know this. - A part of me thinking maybe they're doing that intentionally, because if there's a rise\nof antisemitism in Jews, there will always like points,\nlike, see, they hate us, so we can do whatever we want. Because you see, if we let go\nof our might and our strength, we're gonna go back to\nthe concentration camps, because you see how the word hates you. - And again, when you say\nthey are people in power. - Yeah, oh, yeah, absolutely. Listen, it's always the people in power. I believe that humans\nare easily corruptible and easily repairable, but the corrupted part is much easier. But people could change, but power, people in power are very dangerous. Very, very dangerous. Especially if you have religion,\nwhich is power by itself. Military might, political\nsupport, and money. Dude, that's a very, very,\nvery dangerous recipe. - You know, all that said, I do believe in the\npower of the little guy, the individual to overthrow\nthe government, you know? I don't know if you heard, but the Arab Spring\nwill, you know, happens. Just among friends.\n- We are Americans, right? - Yes.\n- We're Americans. - Yeah, allegedly.\n- We're Americans. (both laugh) - How funny is that? Like, just given our two backgrounds, we're Americans.\n- We're Americans. We're Americans. It's like... (both laugh) We're Americans. There's one thing about, like, the power of the little guy\nthat I am very sad about. Because you see, I love\nAmerica by the way. I consider it my new home. And I want my kids to grow up here. I am very grateful for the opportunity that I have in the United States. And I criticize the\nUnited States politics, and I criticize it out of love, the same way that I was criticizing what's happening with Egypt out of love. What is worrying for me is how the power of the little man is diminishing. It doesn't matter now who\ndo you vote into power, they will not listen to you. They would listen to the people\nwho paid them to be there. And it is very concerning, because I can see the\nAmerican democracies turning, not even slowly, very\nrapidly into an oligarchy. If I'm sure that all of\nthe millions of people who are voting, they\ndon't vote for the NRA. They don't vote for APAC. They don't vote for the\npharmaceutical companies. They don't for vote for the\nmilitary industry complex. And yet, the people in\npower, they come in, they take your vote and my vote, and they're loyal to\nthose people, not to us. And it is very, very, very\nconcerning, very concerning. And this is the danger\nof the American policies, or American politics and\nAmerican democracies. It is dangerous because\nbasically the vote becomes just like a ceremony, that\nsomeone with the more, like, funding will get to power, and then he is not loyal to you. - So the fire, I mean, we are in Texas. Everybody's armed to the teeth here. - Yeah, but like, what are these arms gonna\ndo in front of tanks? - Well, you said the American military is unique in this way. - I know, but for now. - For now, the tanks are, first of all, I believe\nRussia has more tanks than the United States\ntanks, I don't know. You know, I'm not an expert in military strategic deployment of arms, but the United States uses\ndifferent kinds of weapons. - They have drones and\nthey have the lasers, and they're sitting\ncomfortably behind the screens. It's kind of, like, it\nturns like, a big Xbox game. - Yeah, and they sell a lot\nof those things to everybody. - It's crazy because the defense budget is 68% of American military. It's like, almost $850 billion each year. And most of that weapons\nwe don't even need it. - Yeah.\n- We just do it because of the contracts. There was, like, an incredible 60 minutes, I'm sure that you saw it. The one about, like, the\ngouging of the prices of the Department of Defense. It was one of the most fascinating things that I've ever seen. They said like, a valve, a safety oil valve that\nused to be sold for $329. Now it is sold for $9,000. Why? Because there's only\nfive weapon companies, and they can control the prices. And in 2006, the whole Apache fleet of the American army in Iraq was grounded, because there is one valve\nthat they were, like, gouging the price and\ndidn't wanna give them. The stinger missile, that's\njust like, the missile, the one that you carry, and then it's like the anti-aircraft, it used to be sold for $25,000. Now it's sold for $400,000. And nobody is doing that, you know why? Because the DoD has fired 130,000 people, including engineers and negotiators. So now in order to cut expenses, now we're paying more money. And the thing is, we do\nnot have a say in this. We do not have a say in how my tax money and your tax money is being spent. Because I'm sure you don't want your money to be sent to Israel like that. I'm sure, even if you're Jewish, I'm sure. I'm sure that, like, I don't want my money to be given to some Muslim countries who kill other Muslims, I'm sure. But it is not, here's the thing, what kind of power do we\nhave other than speaking? So what is left for us is free speech. And now when you speak,\nthey call you anti-Semitic. You see why I'm angry? (laughs) - But still, I mean, America's\nholding pretty strong despite the criticisms\non the free speech front. But if you look at the\nfreedom of the press, freedom of the speech index,\nAmerica is not at the top. - It is not, and this is why, for example, it is very disheartening for me to see that the Western media, Western press, that used to be the beacon of freedom are now using as mouthpieces. And it is funny how the New York Times, Nixon got angry in the\nNew York Times in 1971 when they found leaks about him lying about the Vietnam War since the beginning. And now, he hired the plumbers, you know, the special units in orders\nto go in and find the leaks. This was Watergate basically, because he was angry\nto see who leaked that, instead of fixing the problem. Now the New York Times\nhave published this story about the rape that was a hoax, that was written by Anat Schwartz, who someone who have no experience. And now when it was leaked, instead of them correcting\nthemselves, they went in and they had their own\ninvestigation to see who leaked. The New York Times in\n2003 became the mouthpiece of George W. Bush of the WMD. And now, as an American, I\nsee that the New York Times is becoming a mouthpiece\nof a foreign country. Why do you do that?"

It does seem that both\nsides use propaganda and both sides lie a lot. - Both sides as in? - Both Israel and Palestine,\npro-Palestine and pro-Israel. There's a lot of lies. - I know, but... - [Lex] I think you're- - It's a lot of inequality, man. There is like a lot of\npeople on the internet, but like, who have the\nmainstream media siding with? - Yeah, but you know,\nthanks to social media- - Yes, thank God for social media, because now it's\nindividuals, they're people. - Yes.\n- They're people. You're comparing BBC, New York Times, Washington Post, World Street Journal with just people with a TikTok account. - Yeah, who has more power in your view? - Now, it is actually\nvery, very fascinating to see the little man having\nthat power over the media. - Yeah, in fact, disproportionately so, like, this is my problem. - But you cannot call people\nwith TikTok propagandists while people being paid\nto give you the news and they deliberately lie to you. - Yes, I can, they're both propagandists. - Well, okay, yes, yes. But like, the mechanism and\nthe intentions are different, because here's the thing. - I'd rather have the TikTok guy than the- - Like, the TikTok guy is\na TikTok guy, all right? But if you have the New\nYork Times being exposed to be lying and then they\nget this, like, UN report, which is, like, a disgrace. And you just put the title\nand you don't talk about it. Like, I'm fine with CNN and Jake Tapper and all of those people, like, spreading the rape allegations for years. I don't even want them to refute them. I want them to bring the Israeli reports saying that it didn't happen. The Israeli media themselves,\nthey didn't even bother. Not once, is that balanced? That's not.\n- Yeah. - So that's why people in TikTok, and because they have to take\nmatters in their own hand. - Yeah, but the problem\nwith the people in TikTok is the drug, the dopamine rush\nof getting a lot of likes. So instead of talking about\nthe death of civilians, they'll talk about beheaded babies or the equivalent of.\n- Yeah, yeah. - They're going to\nactually make up stories, because the made up stories\nare going to be more viral. And so now we're just in this\nscene, this muck of lies. - And there's a lot of people who actually expose those lies on TikTok. So you have both.\n- Sure. - You have both. And it's the kind of, like, the democracy of the social media as we always call it. But if you have the state-run media, that is the legacy media, CNN, BBC, New York Times, Fox\nNews, all of those people, and they are, like, spreading lies, and they're not even doing\ntheir journalistic job in order to at least bring the other side. - Yeah.\n- That's problematic. - And that's worse, you're\nsupposed to be journalists. - Yes, it's supposed\nto be reports, reports. - Yeah.\n- You know, report? - Yeah, but, you know, I see that this is like a catalyst, an inspiration for the citizen\njournalists to rise up. - This is what you're doing. - Oh, this? Yeah. - This is what you're doing. No, this is what you're doing, because you go into the deep dive. - Yeah.\n- This is, like, a no filter thing, there's no spin. - The long form, the long\nform is gonna save us. (Bassem laughs) - I see why you hate the TikToks, like, a dopamine rush. - Stupid TikTok, five hours later- - I saw the resentment\nin your face. (laughs) - I can't look away. - Like, those 30 seconds,\nI do four hours. (laughs) - I mean, both have a place. Both are exciting and,\nyou know, but I can't, it is very dangerous. Like, you can't look away.\n- Yeah. - And I almost never,\nmaybe I'm doing it wrong, but I almost never feel better ever after having used TikTok. - Makes two of us, I\ncan't, I cannot, I cannot. I have a team, by the way, I give my password to, like, a team. I don't even go there, because I went, I once, in a\ndark night, very late at night, I went to TikTok and\nit was like, two hours. What?\n- Yeah. - What? I said, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, this is dangerous. I'm really, like, an\nInstagram and Facebook guy. I don't need that. - Well, even there- - And I barely get out of Twitter. I mean, like X, I don't, I can't. X is a cesspool. X, it's just, like, the\nconcentrated hate in X is too much. It's too much, I can't. - [Lex] So, you don't check it at all? Or you try not to check it at all? It is very intense. - I don't, I don't, I don't at all.

Like, ah, that's things Muslims do. But anyways. (both laugh) - I love that line. - I think the whole\nidea, like, my shock is, I told you about, like, what Biden said about like, I'm a Zionist. Okay, we are a Zionist. But then like Jews are not safe\nanywhere other than Israel. It's like, dude, what\nthe hell are you saying? And if you don't care about me and you don't care about my misery, why would I care about you\nwinning or losing, you know? And I have a joke that\nI told people, like, why would even Biden listen to us? He just raised $145 million in California alone\nfrom pro-Israeli groups. I mean, what can we Arabs working in the vape business do to him? (both laugh) It's like, we cannot compete with that. I mean, like practically, I\nmean, it's like, life is unfair. The guy is a politician. He needs bills to pay. He needs a campaign to\nrun, he needs money. He will go to the people\nwho will give him money. Joe Biden is the highest paid politician from Israeli lobbyists,\n$4.6 million over the years. - Yeah, but I also\nbelieve in great leaders that go against all of that. But unfortunately, you know? - Bernie Sanders was like that. - Bernie Sanders, yes. But also age, I don't wanna be ageist. - Of course, of course, no, no. - But even with like,\n'cause I remember listening to Bernie Sanders 20 years\nago on Thom Hartmann show. And I don't wanna say\nanything against Bernie, but like, he was sharper then. - Of course.\n- There's a thing with age where-\n- Yeah, of course, no, I think I'm a huge fan about,\nlike, putting the limits on your working years, because\nyou don't wanna have, like, a Mitch McConnell moment every now, because now the whole thing\ngot like, what is this? Is this not like a hospice care home? It is unfair, it is unfair. And that the whole idea that you have, like, you have a limit for the president, but you don't have limit for congress people and senators. What do you mean? This is basically, you can go in and be in governance forever. And you know, the longer that you can get, the more corrupt you'll get. - Yes, that's the thing. - And that is very\nconcerning for Americans. - Everybody, everybody\nbecomes corrupt after. - Yeah.\n- I mean, that's why two terms is a good limit. - For Everybody.\n- Yeah. And you know, maybe half a\nterm for Egyptian leaders. - Well, you know, our half\nterm is 15 years. (laughs) - Quarter term. (Bassem laughs) You should come back and\nrun for office there. - Oh, my God, no, no. There's a curse in Egyptian presidency. Nobody comes there like,\neither all dead or in jail. - Yeah. - It's not the most appealing job. - They might make a statue of you though. Make you look good. - After my death. (laughs) I look very good dead in the statue."

And it's kind of, like, pretty much, I would have to cite credit to Putin. He's, like, bringing us the essence of the dark ages, the middle ages. It's like, you know, like,\nbasically Putin is like, is the living example of what happens if \"Game of Thrones\" was reality. It's like death by poison. Like, I'll blow up a plane.

It's a television show. - Maybe that's what attracts\nus to that part of the world is that it's so much on display, this game of power, of geopolitics. - Yeah.\n- Of war. - No, but the same happens in the West, but behind closed doors. - Yes.\n- It's not that open. - Not pronounced.\n- It's not that pronounced. You know, it's like, oops, Epstein. - Yeah, yeah. (Bassem laughs) - It's like, oh! I think because of the\nWest is more advanced, like in movies and cinemas,\nwe kind of direct it better. - Yeah.\n- I think the outcome's like, the way that you kind\nof, like, set the scene, it's like, hm, scene and scene. - That's why people are about\nlike landing on the moon.

I don't think that will happen further. - Wait a minute. - Yeah.\n- Yeah? - Because here's the thing. Humanity is destined to\nhave war, it will have war. But something happened\nin the last 50 years. Now we have much more lethal weapons. The problem is at the beginning, it's like swords against\nswords, horses, cavalier, like, cannons, catapults, mini missiles. But now, we're like, you know,\nlike, a press of a button, you can annihilate the whole planet. - Yeah.\n- And this is the problem. Wars will always continue. The problem is when is\ngonna be the tipping point where we are actually\ngoing to destroy ourselves. And it is so easy now\nto destroy ourselves. The amount of weapons and the quality of weapons that we have, it is designed to kill more\neffectively, it is crazy. It's like, we can create our\nown destruction on ourself. And I think we're not\nthat far away from it. - Just looking at nuclear weapons, the fascinating thing\nabout nuclear weapons is I've gotten to learn recently just how few people are involved\nin a full on nuclear war that kills, basically, kills everybody. - Yeah.\n- Well, three plus billion people right away. - And the consequences of the nuclear winter, it's unlivable. - But all it takes is, I\nmean, one president can do it. So it could be even a false\nalarm, misunderstanding. - Like, what happened in\nthe Cuba Missile Crisis. - But again, and now there's\nmore nations are prepared and ready to launch.\n- Yeah. - I don't know.\n- And you have a media and a 24 hours kind of, like, thing that makes you, like,\nat edge the whole time. - Oh, that's dark.\n- That's crazy. - There's a dark perspective on this where there's certain members of the media that would kind of enjoy the prospect of nuclear war, like, a little bit. Just let's get us close to it as possible. - You have another factor that will contribute to that. Religion. And you remember how,\nlike, the radical Islamists talk about, like, the\nend of time and whatever, but like, most of the Islamic\ndon't have that much power. Problem is with Christian\nZionists now being on the top of the world with America. They have been pushing\nfor that kind of conflict to kind of escalate, escalate. Listen to Sarah Palin, it's\nlike, God wants us here. Like, Karl Rove, all of the new cons. The dispensationalist, Reagan. There's an incredible book called, like, \"Forcing the Hands of God.\" Oh, beautiful book. I read this like, it's published 1998, but it still matters today. The whole idea about like, especially the Zionist Christians who love Israel, but they hate the Jews. They're anti-Semite, but they love Israel because of its role. This is all basically formed because of the interpretation\nof the Bible of Scofield and how they talk about the\nend of time, the Armageddon, and then late great planet Earth, and then left behind\nserious and all of that. It's all about like, we\nare heading to Armageddon. And the problem is, there are people that believe that the end of time. And then we have the Christians that believe in the end of time. And then you have Israel happy that those people are using\nit for the end of time. And then the whole idea about\nthem pushing as many weapons and troops and people in the Middle East to be there for the nuclear holocaust. And John Hagee, one of the\npastors talk about that, about the brimstones. And it's not gonna be a nuclear holocaust. All that people, it's crazy how people are so despising life that\nthey are wanting death. So now, you all would\nhave these revelations, but these revelations mean nothing if you don't have an effective weapon in order to make it happen. And this is the crazy thing. And I'm worried that the end\nit's going to be by someone that wants to meet God\na little bit earlier. - Somebody who's really in a hurry. Well, I have good news for you. Maybe we'll become a\nmultiplanetary species. - Maybe Elon Musk will lead us, lead the way.\n- To get out in space. - Maybe he's one of them,\nhe's a secret lizard. - I asked you offline to not\nmention the lizard people. (Bassem laughs) - There's like a whole people that believe in the\nlizard people, it's crazy. I actually have to be honest, I haven't fully looked into lizard people. I probably should.\n- You should. - Yeah, well, maybe I'm\nafraid of the truth. (Bassem laughs) (Bassem humming) (both laugh) - Removing my face now."

You know, remember like,\nthe joke that said like, we thought that, like,\nwhen we have internet, we gonna have like, be more,\nyou know, more informed. And now, we're watching twerking\nvideos, and that is true. But on the other side, the fact that you have availability of information. I'm learning a lot, and there's people who are using that platform for that. It's not the majority because, you know, it's not very interesting and exciting. But I think there might be a tipping point where there's enough\npeople that would be aware and maybe they would\ncollectively do something in order to bring back the\npower to the small man. And maybe it sounds very\nnaive, but we don't know. We don't know, because you've already seen the legacy media and the\nlegacy politicians shaking in the past few months. - [Lex] They're getting nervous. - They're getting nervous, because people are calling them out. And those people were, like,\nhiding behind their desk, behind in their offices and not like, not holding a vouch for that, but, like, people now\nare calling them out. And it is not gonna happen,\nlike, this year or next year. But I think it's something. - What advice would you\ngive to those young folks? - I will never give\nadvice to those people. (both laugh) - Get off TikTok. - I will never because, like, their input is different than mine. - Yeah.\n- But like, there's one thing I\nlearned when people saw me. Did the revolution fail in Egypt? Did people that the people are, it's like, listen, the revolution is not an event. It's not like, hey, we go\nin, we topple the government. It's not a revolution. A revolution is a process,\nit's a very long process. And maybe that process, I mean, as much as we don't like what\nhappened in the Arab world, but the people there, the\nawareness that happened and the discussions that have been opened, that you didn't even imagine would happen in the Middle East is happening. And maybe the beginning\nof any, any hope of change is that people start\ntalking, speaking out, talking about stuff they were\nnot allowed to speak about. Like, for example, Israel. (laughs) - The revolution continues. - Ah, yes. - Bassem, you're a beautiful human being. It's truly a pleasure\nand honor to meet you. I could just feel the\nlove radiating from you. I hope I get to see you perform live. I hope to get to see you many more times.

It doesn't matter now, who\ndo you vote into power, they will not listen to you, they would listen to the people\nwho paid them to be there. When the military came in,\npeople were walking to me, like, pointing their fingers like,\n\"Don't speak about this, don't speak about the army, huh? We love you now, but don't you.\" They were like that. So I called Jon Stewart. I was like, \"I don't know what to do.\" And he said the most\ninteresting thing ever, and he said, \"If you're\nafraid of something, make fun about the fact\nthat you're afraid of it.\" - The following is a\nconversation with Bassem Youssef, a legendary Egyptian-American comedian, the so-called Jon Stewart\nof the Middle East who fearlessly satirized those in power even when his job and\nlife were on the line. Bassem is a beautiful human being. It was truly a pleasure\nfor me to get to know him and to have this fun, fascinating, and challenging conversation. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Bassem Youssef. Your wife is half-Palestinian, and I've heard you say that\nyou've been trying to kill her, but she keeps using the\nkids as human shields. So have you considered\nnegotiating a ceasefire? - Well, the thing is, every\nday, every minute of the day in a married life is a negotiation. Everything can blow up\ninto a full-scale war. Starting from a simple sentence like, good morning, what should\nwe do with the kids today? What should we do with\nthat piece of furniture? Any sentence can lead you to heaven or to hell in the same time. - So, you do negotiate with terrorists? - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, 100%.\n- You must? - Yeah, and for her,\nI'm her terrorist too. So, it's equal. (chuckles) - Terrorist on both sides. On a more serious note, when you found out about\nthe attacks of October 7th, what went through your mind? - If I'm allowed to use\na curse word, I was like- - As many as possible.\n- I was like, \"Oh, shit.\" Part of my standup comedy\nis, I describe a situation where I was in a\nrestaurant with producers. And there was a bombing two blocks away in Chelsea, New York in 2016. And of course, this is the like, damn, what's gonna happen to us now? And there's, like, two\ndifferent reactions, there's, like, the white\nreaction, which is like, oh, my God, I hope nobody\nis hurt, this is terrible. I hope everybody's okay. And there's the Arab reaction, What's his name, what's is his name? What is the name, you know? Because you know what's gonna come. I was scared what's gonna\nreally happen in that area. And I said like, \"Oh, my\nGod, it's gonna be horrible.\" And the way that it was reported, I didn't know how to handle this. So basically, I went into\nhiding for a few days, three or four days. And I talked about Piers Morgan team talking to me two times, three times. I was like, \"No, I can't.\nHow can you defend that? How can you defend the rape, the decapitated babies and whatever?\" And then I started kind of\nlooking in the news a little bit, and then I started seeing\npeople coming on the shows and saying things that I\nknow as an Arab, as a Muslim, as someone from that\nregion, that it's not true. But I didn't know what\nto say, how to say it. So I said, by the third\ntime when they asked me, I said like, \"Fine, put me on.\" And I went there, it was\nmore of a, (chuckles) figuratively speaking, a\nsuicide mission. (chuckles) Because it's a lose-lose situation. I can lose stuff in Hollywood. I remember my managers\nlike, \"Bassem, be careful. I mean, are you sure you wanna do it?\" My manager was like, \"Please don't do it. Please don't do it.\" And on the other side,\nif I don't perform well, whatever well means, I'm gonna\nbe rejected by my own people. So it was a lose-lose situation, because whatever I say,\nit will never be enough, and whatever I say will\nnot be good enough. And I was going into there, and I felt that I was going into a\ntrance for the 33 minutes that I was on that interview\nfor the first time. - You blacked out?\n- I blacked out. I blacked out, and a\nlot of people asked me, \"Is the earpiece, was that a bit?\" When the earpiece kept falling. It's like, no, it was really falling off and it disconnected, and I had to save it because I cannot see them. I can just hear them, and I\ncould expecting at any time, \"Okay, Bassem, thank you.\" I was like, I was fighting\nfor every second to say words, to put stuff in there. - Yeah, for people who don't know, this is your conversation, interview with Piers Morgan\nand you couldn't see. - I couldn't see, I was just like, the lens of the camera and I was- - Just like a surreal dream or nightmare. - Yeah, hello, Bassem.\nHe's like, \"Hello, Bassem.\" I was like, \"Hi.\" (laughs) - [Lex] And it could end at any moment, your career and everything. - Everything, yeah, yeah. - [Lex] So, what was\nthe drive that got you to actually do it, to overcome that fear? - Multiple things. First of all, I don't wanna\nsay it's just my wife's family, because my wife's family\nhas always been there, but this time was different. The bombing, the attack, they're usually one of those people that they're away of everything. Whatever happened in Gaza,\nthey are always in safe places. But this time, it seems that\nthere was no place safe. And already, we heard about, like, two, three of the cousins and the uncles already lost their home. So, this was too much. So, I wanted to say\nsomething for those people, because I know that, you know, one of the jokes that I made about like, \"Oh, you know, Hassan,\nher cousin, he's a loser,\" He's a doctor, he's a doctor. And every time a hospital was bombed, we were worried about him. So, I wanted to say that\nbecause I felt that these are, this is a family that I\nhave never seen in my life. I've never, she actually\nhardly saw an uncle or two, because, you know, they cannot leave. But I said like, I need to speak, at least I do something\nfor those extended family that I have never known. But also because when Piers Morgan team called me a couple of times, I said, \"Okay, let's see what's\ngoing on in the show.\" And I just watched the stuff, and the lies and the one-sided reporting, that made my blood boil. And then I thought, like,\nwhat am I afraid of? I'm afraid of if I say\nsomething, I can lose my career. I was like, wait a minute. But that was the reason why I left Egypt. I said, wait, I left Egypt. I came to United States. I came to the land of the free where I can say anything I want, and yet I have limitation of what to say? I mean, I thought we\nleft that shit behind. I mean, what's happening? And I understand, I\nunderstand the connection of like, how sensitive it is\nwhen you speak about Israel and all of the ready-made accusations. But as an Arab, as a Muslim,\nI don't react the same when you talk about Saudi Arabia or Iran or Egypt or any of them. It's like, \"Hey, you wanna\ndiss some of these countries? I'll do that with you.\" Because I have strong\nopinions about what happened, and I already been expressing them. And there's a lot of Jewish people who come to my show, and\nthey understand that. They understand the separation, but that kind of a grouping\nof blackmailing people and saying and not saying\nwhat they have in their mind, it is that kind of,\nlike, one of the things that kind of, like, pushed\nme to go on the show. - The thing that was bothering you was it what was being said\nor how it was being said? - Both, because there are lies, which is usually in the media, but there was the total\ndisregard of humanity. You talk a lot about in your\nshow about human suffering. And I felt that here, the\nhuman suffering was not equal. That's why I came up with this, like, what's the exchange rate today? What's the exchange rate today? Of course, it's terrible\nto see anybody die, but I feel that like, isn't\nour life not worth anything? - Yeah, you had a chart. - Yeah.\n- That came to crypto. - Yeah.\n- You analyze it from an investing perspective, of course, in a dark humor- - That's the ROI on that.\n- ROI. (Bassem laughs) And that you were saying that a certain year was a good year. - Yeah, 2014.\n- 2014 was a good year for investment purposes. And also to refer to the family member that you called a loser, you were saying that you called him, had a conversation with him, and he keeps saying that\nhe's not using anybody for human shields, and then\nyou called him a loser. What are you, you can't even give a job. - The liar, he lied to us\nbecause I have to believe. But this is the one thing, it's like, it's also one of the things,\nlike, how it was said. It was stuff that I've been hearing. I don't know what turned on in my head, but it's stuff that I've been hearing all my life from the media. Israel warns civilians\nbefore bombing them. And that's okay, but that's not okay. Israel is trying to\nminimize the civilians, but killing them anyway. And that's okay, but that's not okay. So it is kind of, like, the indoctrination that we've been hearing as if it is okay, and then, suddenly, it's not. - Yeah, there's a kind of\nseveral layers of bullshit, almost sometimes hiding the obvious horror of the situation with kind of politeness and all this kind of stuff. Just the basic value of human life. That said, it's a difficult situation. - It is, it is. - What would you do if you were Israel? Bibi called you, Bassem, big\nfan, big fan of your comedy. - Mm-hm.\n- First of all, would you hang up right away? Would you hear him out? - Oh, I will definitely\nhear him out. (laughs) I was like, that was like, \"Wait a minute! That's material, that's material. That's material, man.\" (both laugh) It was like, so Netanyahu called me. (both laugh) - Yeah.\n- I was sitting with my family, it's like, I'm on my phone and was like, oh, Netanyahu. (both laugh) - Yeah, it just shows up that way. I mean, what would you do? What would you do in this situation? - To answer this question, we need to understand how Israel thinks. There is an incredible\nspeech given by Gideon Levy at a famous Israeli report in Haaretz. And he describes a situation where he was in the West Bank\nand there was a checkpoint. And in that checkpoint, there was an ambulance\nwith a Palestinian patient. And it was there sitting for\nan hour and a half, not moving. And then he went to talk to the soldiers, like, \"Guys, why are you\nnot letting them go?\" He's like, \"Ah, let them go.\" And then he told them, \"Imagine\nif he was your father.\" And the soldiers stood up and was like, \"What? These are pigs. These are not humans.\" So when you tell me what would\nyou do if Israel would do, we need to ask, how does\nIsrael look at the Palestinian and view the Palestinians? Because they do look at\nthem less than human. And there is an incredible talk by Meyer. He was a holocaust survivor. And he said, \"I learned in Auschwitz when I was there in the concentration camp that in order for a\ndominant group of people to dehumanize another group, they need first to dehumanize themselves.\" And Israel looks at\nPalestinians as lesser people, as lesser beings, as some\npeople who are dispensable. And the way that they treat them is that they don't really care about, like, that's why that\nthe exchange rate thing. So for me, if I am\nIsrael, it will be like, what would you do if\nyou're the United States in the time of the Native Americans? They were killing people\nwith the millions. When you dehumanize a group of people, you really don't care. So if I was Israel, I would do exactly what Israel is doing right now, because there is no one\nis holding me accountable. There's no one stopping me,\nand I can get whatever I want throughout my a history through violence. - I think a lot of the\nthings you just said are a tiny bit slightly exaggerated. So, let me try. - Please, please, please.\n- Let's try. So not everybody in Israel.\n- Of course. - So let's look at several groups. So people in government, IDF soldiers and citizens that are neither of those. And not everybody of any\nof those sees Palestinians as less than human, just some percentage. So what percentage is that in your sense? - It's the people who have the power. - So it's mostly the\nfocus of your commentary. When you say people in Israel, you really mean the people in power. - The people have in power. But as much as, like, of course, I mean, the people of power. Because even when I speak about America, I speak about people in power. When I speak about Egypt, I\nspeak the people about power, because, like, you can't really talk about the 100 million people in Egypt or the 11 million people in Israel. Of course, not, there are people who go in and they demonstrate against Netanyahu and they want him out of the government. But we have to admit\nthat the Israeli society, at a whole, have moved\nquite bit to the right and has been, like, many extreme. And you know what happens\nwhen you go to the right or you go to the most extreme, the other person go to the most extreme. And extremism breeds extremism. So thank you for that clarification. But like, I really meant\nwith the people of power. When people criticize the\nUnited States for going in Iraq, of course, I'm not criticizing citizens. - But you made another point,\nwhich is an interesting point, and it's very difficult to\nsee in the heart of people, but I wonder if you look\nat the average Palestinian and the average Israeli, and\nwhen they look at the other, do they have some hate in their heart? Well, everybody probably has some. What is that amount? You know, when you look at a person that looks different than\nyou, how much hate is there? - It depends on what is the\nliving situation of each person. So in the Berlin Film Festival, just like a couple of weeks\nago, there was an Israeli and a Palestinian receiving\nan award together. And the Israeli director said, we're gonna go back to Israel. He's gonna go to the West Bank. He will have no rights, and I\nwill have full living rights. These people managed to work\ntogether and be friends, and they have empathy to each other. Now the average Palestinian,\nit's a very difficult question. Because is it the Palestinian in the diaspora or the\nPalestinian in Gaza, or the diaspora in the West Bank, or the one as a citizen of\nIsrael who still have less right than a normal citizen of Israel, the Jew? And it really depends. There are Arabs in Israel\nwho are having a great life. And there are people, Arabs, who are having a miserable life. But definitely, people that living in Gaza or in the West Bank is kind of, like, on the lower tier of\nthe living conditions. Now let's talk about the hate. What does that Palestinian\nsee with the Israeli? The Palestinians see oppression, limitation of movement,\nlimitation of freedom. And then when there's something happens, you see the full force coming\nin, destroying their home, taking away members of his family. There would be absolutely no reason for him to love the other. The Israeli, because, you know,\nhe doesn't have the power, but he lives under his government, all he sees is the rockets or whatever. But like, he sees the reaction and he doesn't see what happened to those. And as humans, we are selfish. We see what really affects us as humans. And I cannot even imagine what it would be like to\nlive as a Palestinian. And I'm not even talking about Gaza, because everybody talks about Gaza. But let me give you an example, and I'm not gonna talk about\nthe 12,000 kids killed in Gaza. Let's talk about just like the\nfour weeks in the West Bank. March 4th, Amr al-Najjar, age 10, sitting next to his father,\nshot while he's sitting in the car next to his\nfather by the IDF soldiers. Mohammed Zayed, 13 years old, March 3rd, shot in front of a UN school\nwhile sitting with his friends. Mohammad Ghnaim, age 15, March 2nd, he shot while standing in front of a storefront during a night raid. February 23rd, Saeed Jaradat,\nhe was killed by a drone fire. February 22nd, Fadi Suleiman killed while standing in front of a\ntop of a Red Cross building. Nihil Ziad, February\n14th, Valentine's Day, killed and shot in the\nhead while leaving school. February 11th, Mohammad\nKhdour, US citizens, killed while being in a parked car. And Moed Shams, February 9th, killed right in front of his home because a military car\ncame reversing back to him, and then somebody opened the\ndoor, shot him and leave. This is a daily life of\npeople in the West Bank. - What is the justification\nthat IDF provides? - Terrorism.\n- Terrorism? - Or I don't know. I mean, you cannot really\nsay, like, human shields, but they would say like,\n\"They were throwing rocks.\" There was a guy who went on Chris Rock and he said like, his son,\na US citizen will kill. And they're like, they\nwere throwing rocks, so we killed him. Even when they were throwing\nrocks, you kill him? But the thing is, you see, this is how easy for them\nto get rid of Palestinians. I had to say I prepared a\nlittle bit for the podcast, because you are in tech. And I am ignorant in tech. There is a movie called \"The Lab.\" It is directed by an Israeli, a director called Yotam Feldman. And he talks about how\nthe military industry in Israel is very advanced. And what is really mind\nboggling is in that movie, he shows how the military\ntests its weapons in the field, in urban areas on Palestinians. It is heartbreaking. You know, as a doctor,\nthere's five stages of trials. There is discovery, preclinical,\nclinical, and then market, and then post-market\nevaluation by the FDA. The FDA approval and\nthen the FDA post-market. Five just to take a pill. And you go in, and he\ninterviews people as like, \"Where did you test this?\" They tested in the field. So when you just like,\nwhen human life so cheap and it is so indispensable, it gave me a visceral\nreaction, because you know, this has been actually\nthe state of humanity. Humanity have lived\nand survived and thrive by actually killing each other. But there was kind of like\na, we are removed from it. People in Greece didn't know what the Alexander the Great was doing. He was killing and pillaging. We call him the great, but he was killing. He was conquering, he was invading. Julius Caesar, all of the\ngreats, he would do it. But killing was difficult. Killing had to have some sort, you have to be with your enemy. Then you go back, catapults, then cannons, then a little bit back, and then you're kind of,\nlike, starting remotely. Now, you're killing people\nbehind the screen with a button, with a push of a button, you know? A lot of people say, \"Terrorism, they killed you with a knife.\" Killed one person with a knife,\nshot you, that's terrorism. But if you fly a $64 million F-16 and you drop up an A-84\nbomb that costs $16,000, that's not terrorism because it's remote. You're behind the screen. So what happened? What Israel is doing? It is removing itself. Like America too, drones. And then when you push someone to be in, they always brag about bombing\nthem to the stone ages. What happens when the screens\nand all of the obstacles that you have been put\nbetween you and those people, that you have treated them this way, when this is a breach and\nyou come face-to-face, you will come face-to-face\nwith what you have created. - Yeah, there's a lot of\ninteresting things you just said. So one is the methodology of killing. If you wanna look at some\nhorrific large-scale killing, people often talk about the\nHolocaust, but that's visceral. You can look at Holodomor by Stalin where the murder is through starvation. - By Churchill in India. - Churchill in India. And The Great Leap Forward.\n- Mm-hm. - By Mao.\n- Yep. - So starvation is a thing we don't often think of it as murder, because it's quiet, it's slow. And the interesting thing about starvation is that the people don't\ncomplain as they're dying, because they're exhausted. That's one, and the other\nis the value of human life. It does seem that every culture has a unequal valuation of human life. So those two things combined create a complicated military\nlandscape of the world. - Yes, but thing is, is\nthat how we would look at technology as the savior? We talk about how AI\ndisrupt, will disrupt, will disrupt, will disrupt. And now, you talk about,\nlike, going to the West Bank, the people in the West Bank walk and they don't see humans. They see people shooting them from towers or behind the screens or doing, and they have like biometrics that is developed by Basil Systems, like, that's done by HP or Google and Amazon who are, like,\npart of Project Nimbus. And you see, in division,\ndeveloping all of this, like, metric and surveillance\nand all of that stuff. And then, you have, like,\nsomething, like, the gospel that, like, people have actually said that the gospel can actually\ncreate a target list using AI and give you a green,\nyellow or a red to go ahead. And now, AI is not just\ndisrupting the market, it's disrupting our humanity. And we became so comfortable\nkilling people from afar, killing people with a push of the button. And now, it's like dating apps, you know, when you swipe left and right,\nand it's like, oh, right. It becomes so, like, cheap. It's not like meeting someone. It's like, ah, ah, ah. It's like a lot of fish in the sea. Same with AI, boom, 500 people killed. Boom, they killed. It's so easy, it's so easy, it's so easy. And then it's so far removed from you. So when you put these\npeople in this condition, you have literally put them in a different universe than yours. You are behind in your\nair-conditioned screens like, pushing them, blowing\nup a university, it's amazing. But then you meet what you have done, that you meet the Frankenstein\nthat you have created. And then people are like, \"Oh,\nlook what they did to us.\" - You just gave me this\nimage of a dating app from hell where leaders\nare just sitting there and kind of swiping left, right. - Just like, invade, destroy. (laughs) - Its boring. - Like a puppet government. (laughs) - Yeah, and then turn off\nthe phone, go to sleep. So you know, I traveled to the West Bank and I mentioned to you offline that I really loved the people there. Just, you know, yeah, I've met\na bunch of people like that in Eastern Europe where I grew up. Yeah, like the flamboyant, the big personalities, all of that. I also met a person who's\nin charge of a refugee camp who was shot by an IDF soldier. And I'm not sure the words\nhe said are important as the consequences of the\nthing that you mentioned, which is the deep hate in his eyes. That didn't feel repairable at all. It was pain, it was like\na foundation of pain and on top of that, a hatred. And I was like, \"Wow, you kill one person, this is what you create.\" - Because we have kind of, like, a front row seat to what's happening, we think we are in it, but\nwe can't really grasp it. I mean, people's like, \"Oh,\nwe're just gonna go in, get Hamas out and we're\ngonna get them back in.\" And what about the people get back in, how do you think they would look at you? What have you created? What have you done? My show in Egypt was all about propaganda. It's all about the use of words. Words are very important. The decapitated babies\nwere not chosen randomly. Because you see, it plants a\ncertain image in your brain. Imagine if you're going\nin, what a baby can do? It can smile, cry and poop, that's it. It's absolutely no threat. So when you tell people,\n\"40 decapitated babies,\" they're so animalistic,\nthey didn't see the babies. Women raped, of course,\nhe's an animal to do that. And they would go through that, and what was very frustrating about the conversation\nis the gish galloping. The gish galloping, throwing. You see the distractions,\nyou see what happens? Like, it's like, what's\nthe proportionate response? Can Israel defend itself? Do you condemn Hamas? Does Israel has a right to exist? Decapitated babies, raped women, why don't the Arab countries take them? Muslims kill Muslims. Look what happened in\nYemen, in Syria, in Iraq. Like, see how they kind of distract you? They throw little things at you so you don't know what to do. Or the UNRWA, the UN, anti-Semitic. October 7th, October 7th, October 7th. And then suddenly, you are distracted and pulled into discussing\nall of these little things, and you're not discussing\nwhat's happening right now. It is basically stalling, giving them time to do what they do. - So there's some degree\nto the propaganda though. So the beheaded babies and\nall this kind of stuff, that is so over the top that it shuts down actual conversation about actual wrongs, war crimes on both sides. So it's overstating it to\nwhere everyone on social media and everywhere in the press\nand everywhere is arguing, almost become desensitized\nto actual horrors of death, which are more mundane. They're not so dramatic\nas beheaded babies. - Yeah, because a baby is\nshot, but decapitated babies. There's like a knife blade\nthat goes into the skin, the trachea, the flesh, the spine. Decapitated. You can just, like, he's dead. But no, you go in, this is the\nhate. This is so much hate. And you know, that's why- - You have made me laugh (Bassem laughs) at the darkest shit. You're such a beautiful person. Your dark humor is just wonderful. - But you see this\nhappened to Jews before. Remember, blood libel?\n- Yeah. - Where did the blood libel come from? - Yeah.\n- It come from these rumors that Jews suck baby's blood. This is what they did to them.\n- Yeah, yeah. - That's what's in the cup.\n- Exactly. (Bassem laughs) That's a very delicious baby cup. - Delicious baby blood.\n- But this is what you do. You tell people something. And it happened with the Native Americans when they were here, when they went in and they wipe a whole tribe. And Jewish people, one of the, like, the minorities that were persecuted and had this used against\nthem for a very long time. And it is terrible and it's terrifying. That's being used again. - So, I just did a very lengthy debate on Israel and Palestine. And the really painful thing from that, those two historians, it was deep, it was thorough, it was fascinating. But in constantly asking about sources of hope or solutions, there was none. There was a sense of, like, a really dark sense of, it's hopeless. From both sides, it's hopeless. So you know, I look to you (both laugh) for a source of hope. Is there any hope here,\nsolutions, short-term, long-term? - Obama have kind of summarized this beautifully in his book. He said, \"The reason why the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict is so chronic is one\nside have so much power and the other side have\nabsolutely no power.\" And that's the one what he says. He said like, \"You have Israel,\" that they basically don't listen to us, because they're supported by people who are bigger than the president, bigger than administration. They know that they can. I mean, like, Netanyahu was\ncaught on tape many times saying like, he's basically,\nlike, belittling Americans. Like, we control 80% of the\npopulation, we don't care. This has kind of, like, nonchalant kind of, like, we have them. And there's nothing really that compels Israel to give up anything. Because at the end of the\nday, what is compromise? Compromise is, like, I give something, you give something. Israelis don't giving anything, and they project that on you. So for example, how many\ntimes have we heard like, \"Oh, Palestinians were given\nlike 4, 5, 6, 7, 15 chances, and they said no to them.\" And yet when you read the history, that's not the case at all. Like, for example, the\nwhole idea about, like, Arafat walked away from\nOslo, that didn't happen. And there is an incredible video by, you know, what's his name? Joe Scarborough with Misha. And they were hosting\nher father, Brzezinski, he was the national security advisor. And Joe Scarborough said like, \"Well, you know, like,\nArafat left the Oslo Accord and the Palestinians left.\" And then Brzezinski said like, \"This is, like, embarrassingly shallow.\" It's like, listen, what happened was, there was a lot of catches\non the Oslo Accord. It was very unfair to the Palestinians. So Arafat has said like, \"I agree, but I need to take\nit to the Arab capitals.\" And they went to Sharm\nEl-Sheik, they came to Egypt. And he and Ehud Barak went to there. And then Ehud Barak left\nbecause there was election, and he lost, Ariel Sharon\ncame, and it was destroyed. This is one of the reason why people, it's kind of, like, facts\ndon't matter as much as what is the narrative\nthat has been controlled. - What were the biggest\nbarriers to peace there? Do you think it's, fundamentally, leaders don't want a two-state solution? Or was there nuanced small differences that if solved could have\nled to a two-state solution? - I mean, maybe there was a certain point when the Israeli leaders\nwere more open to compromise. But I can't say that, because each time Israel gives back land, it has to be after some use of force. The 1973 war, the Antifa,\nthe first and second, the casualties in Gaza. They never give up land\nwillingly and because of peace. Because if I have that much military, I can do whatever I want. Why would I give up anything? I have that much power. Why would America or China give everything if they're so powerful? And especially, if they\nhave this kind of open check from the United States. So, it is really about what can push Israel to give up something? Because you are so much stronger than me. What could compel you\nto give up something? And this is why the\nwhole thing about, like, trying to equalize Palestinians and the Israeli state and government, it doesn't make any sense. - So what is the source of hope? You know, Jon Stewart,\nwho we'll talk about from many angles, somebody\nyou admire, a friend, he proposed a two-state solution. - [Bassem] Of course. - Look to the comedians for hope. - Yes, well, everybody's talking about the two-state solution, but Israel has said\nmany times on Netanyahu, like, there's gonna be no state solutions. In the past, it's like,\neven Naftali Bennett, he came in on \"HARDtalk.\" He's like, yeah, maybe in the past, we wanted two-state solutions. But like, look, every time we\ngive them land, they kill us. So no state solutions, and\nthey are openly saying it. - But that's perhaps rhetoric. - The rhetoric that is\nsupported by action. Because look at what they're doing in the West Bank that you said. They are cutting it, illegal\nsettlement, piecemealing it. So if you have an intention\nat all to give them anything, why would you keep doing this? - And you've called it\na bunch of little Gazas. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n- It's a nice little picture of what's happening. - Piecemealing it, what happened in the past four months, the Palestinians have\nbeen microdosing on it for a very long time, little\nby little, little by little. And we would shout every time when it gets too much\nand then we shut down. And then little by little,\nbut this time it was hard. It was hard to see the blatant oppression. And the world said,\n\"Maybe the Hamas Ministry of Health are giving us the bad numbers. Maybe it's just human shield.\" And I laugh, there's 13,000 babies killed. Does that mean that there\nare 13,000 military target hiding in their diapers? Because it doesn't make any\nsense to kill that many babies. It's like, \"Oh, oops,\njust out of our hands.\" - It's hard to know what\nto do with those numbers. I mean, just one baby is enough. - But you know what happens\nwhen you hear so many numbers? Numbers become numbers, and\nyou become so desensitized. And this is why there's a difference between saying 13,000\nPalestinian kids dead, just like Mila Cohen, an\nIsraeli baby, 10-month old. She was killed in her crib. And this is what we hear from CNN. We never hear a story\nabout the Palestinian kid. That's why thank you\nfor giving me the space for saying the news of\nthe Palestinian children that were killed just for four weeks. Like, it's because humans needs context. They need depth. They need, like, a 3D look\nat what they can look at. But if you just tell 'em numbers, oh, they don't mean anything. - Is there some degree to\nwhere both leaderships, Hamas, PA, Palestinian\nAuthority, Israel, all want war? Like, perpetual war to remain in power? - That's an interesting question. But I mean, let's admit something. The Arab regimes in the\narea have actually used the problem of Palestine\nin order to stay in power, in order to get excuses\nto like, have this enemy, and Israel, the Israeli\ngovernment has used that too, and maybe the Palestinians. But my problem with when\ngoing into discussion this is that the two sides are not equal. They're not equal in power,\nthey're not equal in influence, and they're not equal in\ninternational supports, especially with the United States. So people who have made changes in history were the people with power. The people who would have\nthe ability to change things, and the Palestinians cannot really change. What can they change? - Well, is that true though?\n- Okay. - With how much support the\nPalestinian people have? So just like you said, there's\na lot of Arab states there that will voice their\npro-Palestinian position in order to distract\nfrom the own corruption and abuses of power in\ntheir own countries. But you know, I don't\nthink, if you look globally, there's a complete asymmetry of power and public opinion here, maybe\nin the press in the West. But if you look globally- - But do they have the\nsame kind of weapons that the Israeli have? - Literally power, no. There's a major asymmetry\nof literal power. - Some money to their leaders. Does that make any difference? I mean, and also when you\nsay Palestinian authority, which authority are you talking about? Hamas or the Palestinian authority who has been kind of a\ndomesticated kind of, like, a puppy, Palestinian\nwho basically have been an informant on their own people. And this is the thing also that kind of, like, really pissed me off when I was hearing the\nthing about these things. Like, Hamas, Hamas, Hamas, Hamas. Like, we have Netanyahu on tape confessing that he supported Hamas\ngiving money in order to cause factions\nbetween the Palestinians. So it's just like, you just told me this. You just told me this. You just told me, did\nNetanyahu support Hamas? It's like, but Hamas, like, what? - [Lex] I mean, to which\ndegree does Netanyahu represent the Israeli people is a real question. - To which point does Trump or Biden represent the American people? - And to which degree does Hamas represent the Palestinian people? - It doesn't. None of these represent it, but who have the power in\norder to make the decisions? It really comes down to that. - Well, who does have the power? You're giving a lot of power to Israel. - Yeah.\n- But the Arab League- - What should Hamas do? What do you think would Hamas do? - Continue doing what a charter says, which is trying to destroy Israel. And the role of the Palestinian\npeople is to overthrow Hamas and get a more moderate\nleadership probably. And the role of the Israeli people is to vote out this right-wing government and elect a more moderate leader, so that there's a chance at\npeace with two moderate leaders. - [Bassem] So before Hamas\neven got to control 2006 Gaza, there was Ariel Sharon in 2000. And we all know what happened. And Ariel Sharon kind of, like, came up with this amazing policy of, like, breaking people's kids'\nbones in the intifada. So, Ehud Barak, he was also like, I mean, which one is moderate? I mean, I think Hamas is a\nproduct of what happened. I mean, if there was no\napartheid in South Africa, there would be no NFC. There will be no Nelson Mandela. If there was no Nazis in Paris, there would be no French resistance. And I'm not saying that. And again, I don't wanna\nbe put in a position to defend Hamas or anybody, because you know what that entails, but those are like, Hamas,\nagain, not defending them, they went into October\n7th, why did they did that? Like, release our hostages,\nthe people in prison. Because if you talk about\npeople who are kidnapped, Israel kidnaps people every single day. And when they had that, the\nfirst exchange in November 4th, Israel leaves 400 people, 3/4 of them were women and children. Why are those people in prison? There's one in four\nkids that are imprisoned that stay in solitary confinement, which is, by international\nlaw, a form of torture. And you're putting kids through that. - So first of all, ceasefire. - Yes.\n- And longer term, is it possible for Arab states and the United States to get together, and with power through\ndiplomacy, enforce a solution? - It's a very, very ideal solution. But you know and I know that Arab states don't\nreally have the power. All of the powers are\nin the hands of America. - They have the power. See, I think they have the power. I don't- - Maybe they don't wanna use it. - They don't wanna, well, that's- - [Bassem] Maybe they don't wanna- - Because there's a benefit.\n- Maybe there's a benefit. - Like, the dark sense I have\nis that a lot of people win from the suffering the\nPalestinians are going through, because they can point to\nthat and distract from- - [Bassem] Definitely, definitely. - Corruption in their own states. And then obviously, Iran can benefit also from the same kind of dynamic distracting from the authoritarian\nnature of their regime. - Definitely, but what is\nthe core of the problem here? Is it the Arab states using the suffering? Or actually the suffering itself? And the suffering comes\nfrom people being displaced. Their homes were taken away. There are 7 million\nPalestinians in diaspora. 7 millions, 7 million went out there, and now they're living in\nCanada and America and Europe. They had homes there\nthey cannot go back to. 1.7 million people of the people in Gaza don't belong in Gaza. They were pushed from other places. The piecemeal thing of\npeople are being, you know, in Germany, I'm gonna\nshift gear a little bit. It's gonna be a little bit of fun. There is a book that I\nbought the rights to, and I want to turn it into a movie. And I bought, I auctioned the right for two years in March of\nlast year, before October 7th. After October 7th, I\nbought the permanent right. That book is called \"The\nMuslim and the Jew.\" And it is written by an\nauthor called Ronen Steinke. I read an article about this book in 2016, and I chased that book for\nrights for seven years. I didn't have that much\nmoney, but I wanted that book. And that book was translated into English called \"Anna and Dr. Helmy.\" And that book tells the incredible\nstory under Nazi Germany where Arabs went in\ndroves to Berlin in 1920s after the 1st World War\nin the Weimar Republic. And they became doctors and engineers and journalists for two reasons. Number one, they're cheap, very cheap because of the inflation. And two, a lot of the Arab nationalists, they didn't want to send their\nkids to England or France, because they were the occupiers. And Dr. Helmy was the hero of that. He's an Egyptian doctor. And that's why I kind of like, I personally kind of connected with him. And he went to medical school, didn't find a place to live. So he lived in the Jewish\nghetto, like many Arabs. He didn't find a hospital to work in, so he worked in a Jewish hospital. So there was a lot of\nArabs who lived together, and actually the first\ndirector of the Berlin Mosque with a Jewish convert\nwho converted to Islam, and he was a gay activist. I'm telling you, this\nis, like, a crazy story. - [Lex] Yeah. - And this is not a fiction story, this is actually, like, a nonfiction. It's written actually\nbased on the statement, the documents of the Nazis in the Gestapo. Dr. Helmy, he was in this hospital. And the Nazis came in and they killed and tortured and beat\nup the Jewish doctor. And they made him the\nhead of his department. So now, he's surrounded by Nazi doctor. They didn't touch him\nbecause he was an Arab. There was kind of, like, a thing between Germany and the Arabs, because they wanted to appease to them in order to have kind of a grassroots base in the Arab world where\nhe want to go next. And this is why 1934-1935, the racial laws of Nuremberg,\nthey had a name change. First they were called anti-Semitic. Then they changed into anti-Jewish, because also Arabs were Semetic. So they wanted to appease the Arabs. Now, what happened, Dr. Helmy, when that happened to him, he\nwould go back to the ghetto and he would see the\napartments next to him. The Jewish apartment become more and more and more flooded with people, because they were moving\nJews and pushing them and putting them together,\npushing them to the side. And each flat, each apartment,\ninstead of one family, it would have three,\nfour, six, seven families. And he was there going at home, and he looked, he was there. This is where the people he\ngrew up with, he lived with. And now, he's seeing that\nkind of discrimination just because he was an Arab. And then he started to kind of, like, atone for, like, because\nhe felt responsible, because he wasn't treated the same way. And he started to go\nand treat Jewish people in their homes, because they\ncouldn't go to hospitals. And then one family\ngave them his daughter. It's like, \"This is Anna, save her.\" He took her, pretended\nthat she's his niece, put a hijab around her, taught\nher Arabic, called her Nadia, my daughter's name by the way. And he hid her in plain\nsight for seven years in front of the Nazis as his nurse. It's an incredible story. And then not just that he went to prison, and then he went out and he\nformed with the Arab people that was in prison with him a\nnetwork that saves 300 Jews. You see that kind of story? This is the Jews that were\nliving in the Arab world. I'm not saying that the\nJews living the Arad world was living, like, an incredible life. Of course, as a kind of a minority, they did not have like the\nfull power of their full, you know, advantages of the rule. That's normal, but we had\nthis kind of a relationship before Israel was erected in 1948. And then, of course,\neverybody looked at Jews at the time as fifth column. And of course, the\nnationalistic regimes used that. And this is why what Biden\nsaid was very dangerous, when he said, \"If there's no Israel, no Jew in the world will feel safe.\" You are the leader of the free world. You are the president\nof the United States. Do you mean that you're telling me that Jews in your country, in the United States of\nAmerica are not safe? That is wrong on two levels. Number one, America,\nhistorically and right now, is more safe to Jews in\nthe world than anybody. They're safer than the Jews in Israel. They never had pogroms or\nthe Holocaust like Europe. They live here a good life, not perfect life, but they're better. Second of all, if you're the president and you're telling that a group\nof people will not feel safe unless there is a different one, you are already feeding\ninto their fifth column. Like, you're Russian, you come from there. And there is a group of laws\nin the Russian constitution that says that Russia will protect its citizens everywhere in the world. What happens if the president says like, \"Oh, you're Russians, you're\nprotected by own country. You don't belong here, this is terrible.\" - Yeah, you're right. That's\nactually an indirect threat. - Yes.\n- You know, even saying Muslims cannot\nfeel safe in America or something like this, that\nmeans like, that's a threat. - But what would a Jewish person in Beverly Hills or in\nBrooklyn feel if he hears that. You are already telling people you need to be loyal to Israel. I mean, Israel is a foreign country. I am sorry, but Israel\nis a foreign country. Israel is a client\ncountry that we sponsor. And it should actually be responsible and held accountable for what they do. - You mentioned 1948, the Nakba. But before that '41, '39,\n'41 to '45, the Holocaust. What do you do? What do\nyou do with the Holocaust? Like, how do you incorporate\ninto the calculus? - Oh, yeah.\n- Of what's- - Oh, it's terrible.\n- Of morality that leads up to the displacement of 700,000\nPalestinians from the land. How do you work that out? - It is terrible, but like, I mean, the systemic annihilation of\nJewish people under the Nazi. That is, like, a carefully\nengineered, thoughtful plan. It was terrible. It was kind of, like, the\nhuman ingenuity put into, like, something that is very evil. But also, it is not just that happened. We need to remember that Otto Frank, the father of Anne Frank, has his visa, refugee visa, rejected\nby the United States. There's a lot of people that were rejected by the United States, rejected\nby other European countries, and then they were pushed into Palestine. So you have to put yourself between like, and the Arabs say, \"Okay, we're\nsitting here, okay, come.\" And then, all right, you don't have a home or a country anymore. That kills you. I mean, you see, if I am not an Arab and you give me that\nkind of piece of, like, terrible human thrash, like,\noh, my God, that is terrible. But then I'm an Arab, it's\nlike, yes, I'm so sorry, but what do I have to do with that? Why is that my fault? The persecution of the\nJewish people have started since the eighth and ninth century, because they were first anti-Christians. They were, like, the criminal immigrants. They were, like, conspirators. This is the antis, like,\npeople, kind of, like, as if Europe kind of, like,\nthrow anti-Semitism on us. You understand that, like, Henry Ford, Henry Ford is one of the biggest anti. He was the inspiration\nfor Adolf Hitler. (laughs) This is how anti-Semitic Henry Ford was. And you kind of, like, gloss over that. And then suddenly, we, as Arabs,\nhave to pay the price, why? - Several questions I wanna ask there. But one just zooming out, why do you think hatred\nof Jews has been such a viral kind of idea\nthroughout human history? - Oh, it's very easy. It all started from Christ. They killed Christ, they killed Christ. They killed Christ, they're\nthe killer of Christ. - That's a very sexy story.\n- Yeah, and that stayed for years. That stayed for centuries,\nI'm sorry, centuries. They're the killer of Christ. And then the Catholic\nChurch did not allow usury, but they would work in usury. So they become rich. Now the people that we hate, that we accuse them of killing\nChrist are becoming rich. So that's envy now, and that's hatred. I mean, when you talk about ghettos, ghettos was not just as\nsecluded parts in cities. Sometimes those ghettos\nwere outside the cities. Jews were not even allowed\nto work a lot of professions. They were not allowed to get into the syndicates of\ncertain professions. So they had to go work\nusury and they got rich, so the people hated them more. The first crusade didn't\nkill a single Muslim. All they killed were Jews. And when they finally\narrived to Jerusalem, all they killed were Jews. They almost annihilated the Jews. So it was all this, and of\ncourse, you have the dark ages. Who do you need as an enemy? The Jews, right? They're the killer of Christ, there's nothing bigger than this. And then you fast forward, I mean, one of the things that I found out that was very, very, very, very crazy. When Henry Ford imported \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,\" by the way, in the Arab world, \"Protocols of the Elders\nof Zion\" is so popular. And for obvious reasons. (laughs) And for the people who don't know it, it's kind of, like, a\nbunch of, like, stories. And basically, it's like,\nthe Jews saying like, we gonna control the war. - Yeah.\n- Then, we're gonna do this, and we're gonna do that, and whatever. What people don't know, that\nthat is a work of plagiarism. It was plagiarized from\na satirical play called \"Conversation in Hell Between\nMachiavelli and Montesquieu.\" And it is kind of, like,\nbased on one chapter or one scene or so, it's crazy. - But it's crazy how sticky it is, like- - Yes, yes.\n- That's weird. - Because if I hate you, that's great. But if I have a story\nto support that hate, ah, that's even better. - But it's, like, one of the best stories, one of the stickiest stories about hate. - Of course.\n- It's probably the most effective, 'cause like, you know, a lot of peoples\nhate other groups of peoples, but that's just like the\nsexiest story of them all. - Because humans need to\nconcentrate their hate, their insecurities, and their\nshortcomings into one thing that they can practice that hate on. If it's a person, great. If it's a group, even better. - Right, how do you, into this calculus, incorporated that that\ngroup is pretty small? There's 16 million Jews worldwide. And you mentioned how is\nthat the responsibility of the Arab peoples, you know? Everybody should be to blame for not taking in Jews\nafter the Holocaust. But you know, the\nreality of the situation, if we look at the religious slice of this, there's 16, let's say, million Jews, and there's, I don't\nknow, how many Muslims, but 1.8 billion?\n- Yeah, yeah. That difference, that 100x difference, do you incorporate that into the sense that Jews in Israel\nmight feel for, you know, the existential dread that this small group might be destroyed? - Jews in Israel have\nevery right to feel afraid, because of everything that they see and everything they've\nbeen told, everything. But I would say that the calculus or the numbers doesn't like, of course, like, being small, it\nis, of course, a factor, but it is never an excuse in order to take something\nthat's not yours. It's saying like, \"Hey, you\nhave 300 million Americans and we have 52 states. Give one state, there's too\nmany of them, too many of you. Just give them something.\" You know, it's like, the\nfact that I have something and you don't, and\nthere are too many of me and there's little of you. And then you come in, and\nit's not really Israel against the Arab world or the Muslim, or because we have to say\nwe fucked up big time. But it is the Palestinians that are in and they are being subjected to that. So it's not really like the 1.8 billion and the 16 million Jews. And the 1.8 billion, if you look at them, some of them, like, don't care. Some of them live in two\nregimes, they're being oppressed. And those regimes are\nsupported by the United States in order, it's easier for me as an empire to take what I want from this country if I control the dictator. And I tell them that his\npower is linked to my ability, to my desire to keep him in power. So that's why you have a total disconnect between people in power in the Arab and the Muslim countries\nand the people themselves. - Can you speak to 1948? You know, 'cause you mentioned\ntaking land that's not yours, maybe parallels with Native Americans. - Mm-hm, yeah.\n- There was a war, the Jewish minority fought that war against several Arab\nstates and won that war. How do we incorporate\nthat into the calculus? - Yeah, well, that's also a misconception, like, a misinterpretation of the event, because it seems that\nit was, like, the small, it's kind of, like, a David\nand Goliath kind of story. And I was always like,\n\"How did we not do that?\" But in reality, with numbers,\nI can't pull it up right now, but if you look at the\nnumbers, the number of tanks, the planes, the trained officer, because many of those Jewish fighters came from World War II, they\nwere seasoned fighters. And they actually had\nmore planes, more tanks, more artillery, more pieces of weapon, more of the all of other combined, because the people that\nreally, like, fought was Egypt. 1948, many of those Arab countries didn't even have their independence. So they would kind of,\nlike, send, like, a cavalry, or like, people in horses. But in fact, the whole idea was like, \"we won against seven nations.\" - Sure.\n- The numbers were totally in Israel favor. They were better equipped,\nthey were better trained. They had, like, more tanks\nand artillery and aeroplanes, and they planned better. So yes, they deserved the win, because they planned and we didn't. - So to you, there was an\nasymmetry military power even then?\n- Yeah. - But what do you do with the\nfact that the war was won? So like, if you look at\nthe history of the world, there is wars fought over land. - I agree with you, this has\nbeen the history of humanity. Humanity was not living peacefully. It's all about, like, people taking people and killing people, taking their land. But there's two difference here. Mostly, usually, the conquering power, like, for example,\nEngland, they had England, and they conquer you in India. And after the occupation\nfinished, they go back to England. France, Greece, Persia,\nEgypt, they will, like, go in, expand and shrink, expand and shrink. It's always been there. What is different here\nis exactly what happened in Australia and the United States. A group of people came in, not just to conquer and take the land, but to completely change, to replace them, and get them out or kill them. It was very easy with the Indians, because they had smallpox,\nthere was no social media. They did it over 400 years, they had time. The problem is what is\nhappening right now, I agree with you, it\nmight not be that new, but we are there and\nwe're watching it happen. - And so, now we have to\nconfront the realities of war and empire and conquering and- - Because, you know, what's the problem? We told ourself we can be better. - Yeah.\n- After 1948, there was the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. It means that we are\ngonna be better humans. We're not gonna kill and take land. We're not gonna displace people. We're not gonna take\npeople for what they have. There's now laws, there's\ninternational laws. There's international court of justice. And now, Israel is giving the\nmiddle finger to all of them. - So isn't it in some fundamental way, this whole thing that we're talking about is us as a civilization on social media, in articles and books and in newspapers, we're just trying to figure\nout who are we as a people. - I think the shock came from the fact that we thought that we\nas humanity have evolved. And now, what have actually changed is that we became more advanced in effectively eradicating\na group of people because of the technology that we have, and the fact that we can do that under the eyes and ears of all the world. And we are watching it on\nour phone, we have a window. We have a window to the war, you know? 1945, people didn't know\nwhat was happening in Japan. Well, we hear about it on the radio. Like, oh, today, our forces came in and they launched, I don't know. We don't know, we heard it. We maybe we saw pictures after\nthat, and it's quite edited. But now, we see it, we're into it. And it is so much for our\npsyche and we can get it. And the Arabs had said like, \"Guys, you told us, we came to the West because we were told that we were equal.\" You know the universal\ndeclaration of right? One of the co-authors, his\nname is Stephane Hessel. He's a Jew, he is a\nsurvivor of the Holocaust. And you know what happened to him? He died, by the way,\na couple of years ago, but before he died, he was\ncanceled by so many people, and he was called anti-Semitic, because he joined the BDS movement and he spoke about the truth of Palestine. That is the author of\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights that we value so much, and we think that that\nwould define our humanity. But then we go in and we are shocked. It's like, maybe we were sold something. Maybe that was false\nadvertisement. (laughs) - You shared a tweet by an\naccount called Awesome Jew. (Bassem laughs) It reads, \"Islamo-Nazi\ncomedian, Bassem Youssef,\" comedian in quotes, by the way. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of\ncourse, because I'm not funny. - So, Islamo-Nazi\ncomedian, Bassem Youssef, is now denying the October. I love that you retweeted\nthis, like, twice. - [Bassem] Yeah. - I guess suppose because it's advertising some\nupcoming dates. (chuckles) He's now denying October 7th massacre. The Muslim radical Bassem Youssef is notorious for his\nradical, radical said twice, for his radical hatred of Jews in Israel. In a recent clip, he claims\nthat the atrocities committed on October 7th are fabricated. We're looking for all information regarding any of his upcoming shows as well as the venues\nwhich host the scumbag. Would Jews feel safe around this Nazi? Nazi.\n- Yeah. - This is my first time\ninterviewing a Nazi. Big honor.\n- I know. It's my first time I\nactually get called a Nazi. - First time?\n- First time. I have been called so\nmany things in Egypt. So in Egypt, I was called a\nCIA operative, a Mossad spy, secret Muslim Brotherhood,\na secret Jew, secret Jew. There was also an article\nthat was published about me in the state-run media saying in details how Bassem has been\nrecruited by CIA agents using Jon Stewart in order to use satire to bring down the country. I was a free mason, an infidel, a member of the Knights of the\nTemple, something like that. And there's actually people, the Muslim Brotherhood on their show, they would say like,\n\"He's actually Israeli, and they have forged an\nEgyptian ID for him to come.\" So it's kind of, like, I said, I left all of that behind and I come here, it's like, boom, anti-Semitic Nazi. Damn! I mean, I really covered everything. I don't know what else. I mean, I think I have.\n- Yeah. - It's kind of, like, I'm collecting PhDs. I'm just, like, getting\nall of these credits. - How do you deal with that? How do you deal with the attacks? I mean, this goes back to the decision to do the interview with Piers Morgan. Like, how do you, like,\npsychologically through all of it? - These kind of attacks,\nat the beginning, it's fun, but when they evolve into something else, so for example, I was like laughing of all of the stuff about calling\nme this, calling me that. But then when people would\ncome and threat the theater, because it's not the people who\nare making those accusations that would come to you, it's\nthe people that will hear and see those accusations and act on it. And there's always the\nfear of like, I mean, we have in the Arab world a lot of things, like, somebody would hear\nsomething about someone else and go kill him and\nwhatever, like, anybody else. But somehow I wanna make fun of it. And to be called an Islamo-Nazi, it must been the funniest thing ever, because Islamo-Nazi, wow! How did you, and a radical Muslim, me? A lot of Islamists hate me.\n- Yeah. - They call me a secular infidel. (laughs) So it's kind of, like, who am I? Maybe I have an identity crisis and I need the people to tell me who I am. - Well, let's go to the beginning. Let's go to your childhood. You grew up in Egypt, Cairo, Egypt. - My childhood. (laughs) - Well, let's figure out how\nyou came to be who you are. - How did you become an Islamo-Nazi? - Yeah, exactly. It's a long journey. I do like the swastika tattoo\non your ass, which I didn't- - How did you see my ass? (laughs) - You know what you did. - I know I didn't.\n- It was very inappropriate. You're also obviously a\nsexual harasser of me. - Is this is like a Me Too? - Yes.\n- This is like, 2020. Someone would come up, it's like, okay. - We have clip it. This is your Me Too moment. All right, so, Cairo,\nwhat's a defining memory, positive or negative, from your childhood? - My memory in general\nwas cool, it was cool. I went to a Catholic school until for primary school, the elementary. And by the time I'm done,\nthere was kind of, like, a start of a decline into\nthe public education. And my parents, they're like\nmiddle-class working officials. My dad was a judge, my mom\nwas a business professor. And they were, like, one\nof the people who's like, they didn't have that much luxury. My dad, like, drove, like,\na regular car, a Fiat, which is, like, the\nequivalent for the Lada, yeah. - [Lex] Thank you for\nspeaking to the audience. - [Bassem] Yeah, yeah, the Lada. - Well, so would that be\na good car or bad car? - No, no it's kind of, like, the minimum. And my dad was not, like,\na man of showing off. Whatever money they would do, they would put it for us, education, give everything to their kids. This is kind of, like, a\nvery, very typical mentality. And I'm sure it's in many cultures, but like, we grew up with this, like, everything that we\nhave is, like, for kids. So they will put us into education. So middle school, 1986 was\nthe beginning of the explosion of, like, international\nschools, private schools. And these schools were\nrelatively expensive. Of course, now with today's\ncurrency, it's ridiculous. But at that time, it's very expensive. So I went to that school. And there was this moment, it was like, you feel less right away. I mean, of course, there's the\nregular bullying and stuff, but it's not that, it's kind\nof, like, you always feel less. You don't have that much\nof, like, purchasing power that can allow you to\ngo to the same outings or travel with them. And even, like, how you dress, it will be modest compared to them. So I was always an outsider. And I compensated with that by two things, being good at school and\nbeing good at sports. So I was not, like, the typical nerd who was just like, that. I was playing football,\nbasketball, track and field. And I was like, one of the people would like to have me on their team. So, I wasn't like, kind of, like, \"Ah, he's a nerd, get him away.\" But I never had a girlfriend. I never had any kind of, like, I was not boyfriend material. So that's kind of, like, it leaves remnants in you\nthat you're not good enough. - But psychologically,\nyou're always, like, when you're by yourself,\nyou felt like an outsider. - Yes. All the time. And that's why it kind of,\nlike, I'm more of a loner. I don't have a lot of logical friends. I have acquaintances,\npeople that I do stuff with, but I don't have, like, the people that I tell them everything. When I went to medical school, now medical school is a different animal. Medical school is where all of the people from the public schools go. Public schools are very, like, they don't have English language\nas, like, a strong part. But they are brilliant people. So because they would\nmostly the study in Arabic, but they are brilliant and they are very, very,\nvery smart, very sharp. But then I'll go there,\nnow, I am the sissy boy from the private school that\ncomes into medical school. Now I'm an outsider again. And I go into residency\nand I pick up salsa. So now, I'm a salsa teacher while being a cardiothoracic\nsurgery resident. And I'm an outsider for the third time, because in salsa, I'm kind of,\nlike, the respectful doctor. And in resident, I'm the\nguy who is just dancing. And everything, of course,\nas a medical resident, you will mess up a lot. - Yeah.\n- So they would always like, \"Oh, because you're a dancer. Oh, because you don't care about medicine. You just, like, wanna go\nthere and dance with women.\" (both laugh) Which is true.\n- Yeah. (both laugh) And so all of my life, I\nfelt that I'm an outsider. I'm not part of the team, I'm\nnot part of the core group. And I have a story that you would love. Right before my residency,\nI was so much into salsa. So I had all of the money\nand then I saved that, and I was working summers\nand I was doing extra jobs. And I took that money and I went to Miami. - Yeah? Nice, yeah.\n- In order to learn Rueda de Casino, which is\nthe Cuban kind of, like, circle salsa kind of thing. And I went there in the summer of 2001. - Yeah.\n- And my return ticket was 9/12, 2001. (laughs) - The universe has a sense of humor, I gotta tell you that.\n- No, no, no. 9/12, I was supposed to be on\na plane coming back to Egypt. What happens? Thank God. I ran out of money 10 days before that. It's like, all right, I changed\nmy ticket and I came back. 9/11, I'm kind of like, huh. My mom, \"Wake up, wake up!\" What? What? And I see like the two\ntower falling, I was like. My mom's like, \"Oh, you're\nhere, you're here, you're here. Thank God, you're here.\"\n- Yeah. - And I was like, I could have\nbeen in Guantanamo right now. - [Lex] Yeah, flying at 9/12. - And by the way, I was\nin Miami, when they went to the flying school in Miami.\n- Yeah. - So, I mean.\n- Yeah. - I had, like, 9/11 written\nall over my face. (laughs) - [Lex] You'd be all over the news. - All over news.\n- Exactly. - And my mom was like, \"What,\nhe went there to dance salsa. I didn't know that salsa is\nlike a name for terrorist.\" - Why salsa, why did that attract you? And what, like, can you\nexplain what salsa is? So I mentioned to you offline that I've been doing a little bit of tango or trying to learn it. - Yeah, like, you know, samba,\nsalsa, bachata, merengue, it's kind of like Latin dances. And it's like, you know, I don't know how you describe salsa. Couple dance on Latin beat. - Yeah.\n- And I did it because once I, and I talk about that in my Arabic standup\ncomedy, not the English. I talk about, like, how I was, you know, I didn't have, like, really,\nlike, a great social life. And my friends went there one day, and then I go into a place,\nit was called El Gato Negro. No, no, it was called\nBig Fat Black Pussycat. And then I think they thought it will be, like, racist or something. So to change it to El Gato\nNegro, anyway, so. (laughs) - Great, great.\n- I know. - Great decision.\n- I know. So I went there, I was like,\n\"Damn, music and women.\" And I'm a doctor. A doctor dancing salsa,\nthat is a chick magnet. - [Lex] Yeah, 100%. - You know, we do everything for that. - All of human-\n- Even power, even money. - All the wars we've been talking about- - Women.\n- At the end of the day- - The approval from the other sex. We are babies, we are terrible people. - Yeah.\n- So of course, like, I mean, that was, like, great. But then as a nerd, I went in so hard, and now I became a salsa teacher. - Yeah.\n- And I earned more money from salsa more than I\ndid as a doctor. (laughs) - I didn't know this part\nof you, that's hilarious. - I know, I was making\nkilling amount of money, like, huge amount of money. And I was just like, you know, I would go finish my shift\nand I'd go to the salsa class. And sometimes, I would\nhave, like, 70 people in my salsa class.\n- Oh, wow. - I had like the biggest\nsalsa class in Egypt. - Wow!\n- In the beginning of the 2000, and it was fantastic. And it was an outlet, because you go there and there's the shifts and people dying. Damn, and you go, salsa. - [Lex] An escape, you\nmust have been good. - I was okay, I was cool. I was fun. There were people better than me. But I have a thing about\nteaching, I like teaching people. - So, you mentioned heart surgery. So what motivated you to become a doctor? - It was a choice of exclusion. I mean, there's nothing else you can do with these high grades other\nthan doctor and engineering. I hate math, so go be a doctor. (laughs) This is the Middle East,\nwhat do you expect? It's either, like, in my\njoke, in my show, I said like, it can be one of three\nthings in the Middle East, a doctor, an engineer,\nor a disappointment. That is the choices that you have. (both laugh) So years after, I'm a disappointment. (both laugh) Here I am. - You're damn good at it though. That's a hard path though. - Yes.\n- Right? And it's a fascinating one. - Can I tell you something?\n- Yes. - That actually I was thinking about, why did I actually go into medicine? And why did I always\nchoose the hardest thing although I didn't love it? And I have to tell you, I had an epiphany only two weeks ago. And I don't know if that's\nactually related or not. You know, remember, when I\ntold you I went to this school and I didn't have that much money, and I didn't have the luxury of time or money to be with those\npeople and do what they do. So by the time I finished school and everybody was going to university, everybody in my school went to the AUC, the American University in Cairo. Of course, private. Like, American education, party time. Like, I mean, of course, they're\nbrilliant and everything, but they have a different,\nyou know, social life. And part of me, now, I kind of, like, I realized that just\nlike very, very recently. Maybe I went to the hardest school ever so I don't have space to\nuse other than studying. Because if I have that much space, what I'm gonna do with it? I don't have that much freedom. I don't have that much money. I can't compete with\nthose people going out. So maybe I need a solid\nexcuse that I'm in a place where I don't have that\nmuch of a spare time. - Is it also possible, I like how this is a therapy session where we're a psychoanalyzing it. Is it also possible that\nyou always just pick the hardest thing you could possibly do? - Maybe, but- - Maybe that's the Piers Morgan thing too. - Maybe, but like when I\nleft Egypt and I came here, I still had the choice\nto go back to medicine. - Sure.\n- But I hated it. I hated it, medicine traumatized me. The amount of, like, you give up. You know, my brother in\nEgypt, he had a daughter. She's a brilliant basketball player. She is in the national team, amazing. I used to play basketball\nalso in the Egyptian league, but I was kind of, like, my favorite position in the\ncourt was the bench. (laughs) And I was not as good as her. And then it was time for\nher to go into college. - Yeah.\n- And he didn't talk to me for six weeks. I said, \"Tamer, what's happening\nto Farido, which college?\" Like, I didn't wanna tell\nyou, she went into medicine. I said, \"What, medicine? Why did he do?\" Because he knows how I hated it. - Yeah.\n- I was traumatized. And I said like, \"Dude,\nshe's a basketball player. Make her go like to an easy school.\" He's like, no, so that's kind of inspired. - You still did it, you still did it. - Yeah, I still did it, but I don't know. Is it because of the difficulty or because of what I told you? Maybe I needed something, maybe because I was not very\nconfident in my social life, so I needed a distraction not to have that much of a social life. - Oh, wow, okay. - You understand?\n- I see, yeah, uh-huh. - So, it's kind of, like, because I will always have\nan excuse I'm studying. I have something. I have exams.\n- Yeah. - And I don't know, I kind of, like, self-sabotaged my own thing, because I couldn't\ncompete with those people on the outing and the money and whatever, so I need an excuse to be as like, \"Oh, he's a doctor, he's studying.\" - At least in your own\nmind, you couldn't compete. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I always felt as less because, I mean, I didn't have any girlfriends in school. Like, I had very little in life. I had everything thrown\nto me came to life. So I always felt, even standup comedy, it came very late to me in life. So I always feel that I'm not good enough. I feel that I didn't spend the time to build the foundation\nthat other comedians do. So I always feel that I am too lucky. I always feel that this\nis a fleeting thing. And when I had the height\nand the fall in Egypt, when I would, like, the top of everything. I was, like, so famous, and then everything was taken from me. That's like, ah, you see. I told you that happens when you don't build foundation, you fall. - Yeah.\n- So I always feel that I am not good enough. Or if I am in a position\nwhere people think I am, deep inside, I am not. You know, that I have a speech impediment, that I was not meant to be a TV presenter? In Arabic, it's very obvious,\nI cannot roll my R's. I cannot say arr, I cannot roll it. So in Arabic, like\nSpanish, it's very obvious. So when I did my first\nvideo on the internet that made me famous, and then I got my television\ndeed back there in Egypt. My partner at the time, he took the video and\nhe went to a producer. He said like, \"Are you\ngiving me a guy with a lisp?\" That's why when I came on television, I was the first ever guy with a lisp. I had two things going for\nme, the lisp and the big nose. And I was always bullied\nfor these two all the time. So I always felt less. - See, but that's a foundation of, like, creating a great person. - Yeah, because if you're pretty, you don't need to do much. (both laugh) - I probably wouldn't recommend\nit, but it is true that- - So, if you are pretty, do some disfigurement\nat your face. (laughs) - Find the flaws and be extremely\nself-critical about them. So you saw Jon Stewart on TV for the first time in 2003, I believe. How did that change your life? - I was in the gym and I was\nrunning on the treadmill. And at that time, CNN was\ncoming, like, on cable. And I was watching, and\nthere is this studio. I don't know what it is. So I put the earphones on\nand I started watching. And I was so taken by this\nthat I stopped the treadmill, and I just, like, stood\nfor 20 minutes like this on the treadmill, and I\njust, like, standing there. I didn't know what he was saying. I didn't understand what is\nDemocrats, what is Republicans, those names that he's saying. What is Fox News? I don't understand. But I was fascinated. There was something, you know, when you don't understand the\nmusic, but you get the rhythm? It was that. - I wonder what that is that you saw. It's like the timing of the humor. I mean, Jon Stewart is one of a kind, like, his biting criticism\nof power, I would say, and also ability to highlight\nthe absurdity of it all. - But you understand, I\ndidn't understand any of that, but I didn't understand\nany of the references. But it's the rhythm, the rhythm.\n- Yeah, the music of it. - You know, sometimes, when\nyou even see, like, a comedy that's a language you don't understand, but there's a rhythm.\n(imitates rhythmic beat) There's something, there's something in the music.\n- Yeah. - So there's something with the videos and the pictures, and he and\nthe face, and people reacting. - Yeah.\n- What is this, what is this? - Yeah, yeah.\n- What is this? And we had the global edition. So I went to the YouTube and I just, like,\nstarted to kind of, like, watch every single episode that I can. I said like, \"Do you think\nwe can have this in Egypt?\" They said, \"Nah, never.\" And then 2011, like,\nI had a friend of mine who was also a YouTube partner\nto something new at the time. He said like, \"Let's do\nsomething on internet. Let's do something.\" I said like, \"I wanna do Jon Stewart.\" It's like, ara ra ra, Do Ray William Johnson,\nJon Stewart will not work. I was like, \"Ah, I want\nto do Jon, that one.\" - Yeah, so that was in there? - Yeah, it was in there. And I did it, and it worked. - Can you talk about 2011? I mean, what was it?\n- Yeah. - The Arab Spring, what is it? People here in America, you know? (laughs) - Depends on which side. - Did something happen or what? - Depends which side of\nthe equation you are. Because for a lot of\npeople, it's a conspiracy. It's American made, it is\nthe Muslim brotherhood. It's the Islamist, it is Israel. It is everything else other than people. Oh, but it's a pure revolution. I think we put too much\nweight on conspiracies. I think it is normal human\nbehavior that then become, get maybe used or abused or taken advantage of by other powers. And then the conspiracy starts. But at the time, the Arab\nSpring didn't start in Egypt. It started in Tunisia. Bouazizi's a fruit vendor,\nlike, burned himself up like, the American soldiers\nwho did that a few days ago, and that kind of sparked\nprotest in Tunisia. And Ben Ali was a dictator in Tunisia for about, like, 20 years,\nand they removed him. So suddenly, it was kind\nof, like, a domino effect. So then Egypt started,\nand it just took 18 days. And you know, people, hindsight\nis 2020, saying that like, you know, just Mubarak became, like, a burden on the military, because the military are the\nreal rulers of the country. You might have a president that kind of, like, have certain powers, but at the end of the day,\nwhen the military sees that a certain president is,\nlike, too much of a burden, too much of, like, a, you\nknow, so like they cut him off. - And Mubarak is the leader of Egypt at the time.\n- At the time. He was there for 30 years. - 30 years. By the way, speaking of which, 'cause it was a joke in\nyour Mark Twain speech. - Yeah.\n- I got teary-eyed just watching that. That was just great,\nyou're, like, fucking great. Like, what you did, the Mark\nTwain awards for Jon Stewart. It's great, I mean, your\ncomedy is great in general, and I wanted to go to your show. I definitely will. But that's, like, a little stroll on the complete tangent of\njust a masterful introduction and celebration of Jon Stewart. Anyway, Mubarak.\n- Yeah. - 30 years.\n- And it's the joke that I say also like, Mubarak, like, was a president for 30 years. Like, oh, my God, we had\na president for 30 years. Like, it's the Middle East,\nit's a very short first term. - Very short.\n- It's like, we're still warming up, baby. - Just Warming up.\n- And I told them like, we need to plan ahead.\n- Yeah. We need to plan our vacations,\nour careers, our jail time. It's just like we need to. (both laugh) - That's great, it's true. - So we had kind of like the shortest, nicest revolution. 18 days\n- Yeah. - And we thought, \"Oh, 18 days, we can change the country in 18 days.\" But of course, we were naive,\nand we had this kind of hope. So Mubarak was removed. There was an interim\nperiod by the military. Took it for one year,\nthen they did elections. Muslim Brotherhood came to power. They stayed for one year. And then the military removed them. And in these three years, my show started. It started by kind of,\nlike, a YouTube video. - It became famous overnight. - Overnight.\n- Yeah. - Five to six videos, boom, went out. And at that time, I was waiting to get my\nclearance to go to Cleveland. I was accepted in a fellowship\nas a pediatric heart surgery in a hospital in Cleveland. And I said, \"All right, I'm just gonna do a couple of videos. Maybe I'm gonna put in on internet. And maybe after a year or two, after I come back from the\nfellowship, somebody will come, \"Hey, why don't you write a show that looks like Jon Stewart.\" That was my mind. Took five weeks. I had my first contract of television. And overnight, the exposure. And over the next two, three years, I had 30 to 40 million people\nwatching every episode. A lot of this, like,\n\"Wow, that's too much.\" That is terrifying.\n- Yeah. - Because it means that\nthere are 30 million people who have an opinion about you. - Yeah, you said there's a lot of aspects of that sudden fame\nthat were just horrible. - It's toxic, it's toxic. It's unnatural, it's unnatural. When people started to\nrecognize me in the street and take pictures, I was awkward. It's like, why do you wanna\nhave a picture with me? Why? Because I didn't feel\nthat I'm worthy enough to be, like, a reward for\nsomeone to have a picture. And I didn't understand it. I was kind of an ass sometimes, because people thought it was arrogance. No, it was confusion. And I remember like, my\ndirector and my producers and people around, they always\nsaw me in a very bad mood. It's like, why are you not enjoying this? It's like, because this is not natural, this is not natural. This adoration, this love,\nand this have to end somehow. And it did. And because, at a certain\npoint, you are human. And people, kind of the\nadoration and the fun and the love comes, because\nthey see you saying stuff because you do your job basically. Political satire is\nbasically us making fun of politicians in the media.\n- Yeah. - And a lot of people have\na lot really strong opinions about politicians in the media. So we came there, we articulate that and we give it to 'em\nand we make 'em laugh. So for them, we made a great job. So why don't you do more? But you are limited. And at a certain time, you can't. And a certain time, you're\nafraid because we're humans. Because you're afraid about\nlike, if I continue speaking up, not like, something will happen\nto me, I'm kind of, like, maybe have some protection\nbecause people see me. But what the people around you? And I've seen that. So that's why, at a certain point, it's like, that's it, I can't. - I mean, there's a lot\nof things to say there, but one of the difficult things\nof fame in your situation is you're not just having\nfun, you're criticizing power. - Yeah, and it is loved by the people, but it comes with a price. Because at a certain, if\nthe power is too strong and you are not into a situation or a system that allows that, that gives you that kind of safety. - So, what happened? (Bassem giggles) - What happened. So the height of my fame, when the Muslim Brotherhood was in power. And at that time, they had\ntheir media and I had one show. I had, like, one-hour per week. And they had five channels, 24/7. And they were like, you know. Jon Stewart said it beautifully once. It's like, we say shit and you say shit, and we just say shit better than you. This is exactly what Jon Stewart was like. We're not better at\nsaying shit back at you. - Yeah.\n- So basically, I had one hour and they had, like, the five\nthing that they were like, you know, they're calling\nme all kind of names, not just me, like, all\ntheir enemies, you know? And then I just had one hour and I would kind of like\nannihilate them in one hour a week. So at a certain point,\nthey would even like, kind of be the side with the army against the kind of the liberal, seculars, whatever you call it. And at a certain point, the army kind of like flipped everybody. - What do you mean flipped? - Like, kind of, like, yeah, they removed the Muslim Brotherhood. They came to power. And I have to say, I admit it, I supported that in the beginning, because I had daily threats. I was actually interrogated and arrested under the Muslim Brotherhood. I was in an interrogation for six hours. And they were asking me\nall day about my jokes. And I used that in my standup comedy, describing exactly what happened in the six hours, and\nit is so funny. (laughs) - Okay, well, it is hilarious. Slow down. You were interrogated by\nthe Muslim Brotherhood. - The general prosecutor,\nthe general prosecutor. And it was based because of complaints by the officials and the government. Because in order the\ngeneral prosecutor to do it, it has to have a high up mandate to bring that person to questioning. - Oh, so they went through\nkind of official channels. - Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely. - It's all-\n- Yeah, it was official. It was legal, legal.\n- Okay, very legal. - So I went there and I asked, and it's kind of, like, a\nbunch of like, insulting Islam, insulting president,\nspreading false rumors. And I went there, and it was funny because I go into the building where there's police\nofficers and there judges, and all of them are big\nfans of the show. (chuckles) And some of them were\ntaking pictures of me. And then I'm sitting there, and it was the most\nridiculous interview ever, because he was asking me about my jokes. He's like, \"What did\nyou mean by this joke?\" And I was like, \"Nothing.\" (laughs) And it was there for six hours. - He's just reading your jokes back to you?\n- He was reading my joke, and he's reading the jokes, and the junior judge is sitting\nthere, like, cracking up. - Yeah.\n- He's like, \"Oh, I remember that.\" He's like, \"Guys, guys.\" (laughs) - That's dark. - It's kind of, like.\n- Yeah. - And I'm laughing, but in the same time, it's like, the whole\nsituation is ridiculous. But then at the end, I\nwas released on bail, so I went back to my show\nand I make fun of that. And you have to be honest, the Muslim Brotherhood were in power, but Egypt were, like,\nright out of the revolution for there was kind of like an equal spread of power between the people. There was not, like,\nsomeone who would come in and just like, the Muslim\nBrotherhood didn't have that power yet, but they were kind of, people saw that they\nwere moving towards that. And then the tension rose, and then there was, like,\na kind of a confrontation between them and the army, and then a lot of people\nwere killed in the street. It was terrible massacre. And then suddenly, I am\nblamed for all of that. It's like, \"You made fun of us, so now it made it easier\nfor people to kill us.\" It's like, \"Dude, come on,\nyou are doing that to me too. I just did it better than you.\" And the fact that you\nsided with the same people that flipped against\nyou, that's not my fault. - Did you criticize the army at all? - Yeah, so after that show, I did, like, one episode against the army and I was canceled the next day. And then I went to another channel, did 16 episodes in a different season. And I was walking on eggshells, and then that was canceled again. And then the production company that was doing my show\nthat we severed ties because we didn't have the show. They had their offices raided. They had people, like,\nhaving death threats. So I woke up one day,\n11th of November, 2014, and my lawyer said like,\n\"Leave the country right now. There is this legal case\nthat they kind of, like, they're coming for you.\" But I said like, \"You cannot.\" This was an arbitration case and I lost against the channel\nthat basically canceled me. And I said like, but there's\nno jail time in arbitration. He's like, \"Yeah, tell that\nto the judge, just leave.\" So I jumped on a plane. The verdict was 12 noon, 11 November, 5 afternoon, I was on a plane, left Egypt, and I never came back since then. - Was there a worry of non-legal\nthings like, assassination? - I can tell you something. I was so stressed because of the show and because of everything, sometimes, I would wake up in the morning and I hope that a bullet will\ncome and finish everything, because I was so stressed. It's like, I would love, because I'm too much of\na chicken to kill myself, so I would, like, rather have\nsomeone else do it for me. So I was so under so much pressure. And I remember the day that, like, my show was canceled indefinitely the second time under the army. And I was like, I don't\nhave to worry about what kind of script I\nhave to write next week, because you know, remember, when you asked me about, like, that tweet? But like, all of those said, those accusation doesn't bother me. Infidel, spy, secret Jew,\nZionist, Islamo-Nazi. That's bullshit. What really leaves a mark is the criticism to your craft and your work. So you're not funny, goes deeper. - Yeah, certain things get\nto you better than others, especially if you have,\nlike, a secret suspicion that you are, like, maybe not funny. - Maybe I'm not because\nI was put into that. It's like, because that\ntouched your insecurities like, I know, but you shouldn't say it out loud.\n- Yeah. (both laugh) - [Lex] You shouldn't\nsay the truth out loud. - You shouldn't say it out loud, like, keep it yourself. (laughs) - But what about the weight\nof the responsibility of speaking truth to power? Sort of, like, walking on eggshells. Like, what did that feel like? - Well, after the Muslim\nBrotherhood were removed, you have to understand, like, when the military coup happened,\nit was a very popular coup. Like, people love the army. In Egypt, the army is more\nsacred than the religion. People love the army,\nthe army can go no wrong. So me going against the army was, I mean, the Muslim Brotherhood\nwas not very popular. They were popular for their own basis, but people accepted the fact that, like, we make fun of them. But Sisi, at that time, he was a God. And I used to go to this\nhigh-class club called Gezira Club. And this is basically kind\nof upper middle class, upper class kind of people. And during that year of\nthe Muslim Brotherhood, I was the most popular ever. People come, yay! When the military came in,\npeople were walking to me, like, pointing their fingers like, \"Don't speak about Sisi. Don't speak about the army, huh? We love you now, but don't you.\" They were like that. So I called Jon Stewart. I was like, \"I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.\" And at that time, all of the channels,\nwere, like closed down. I was the only one left because\nit was difficult for them to get rid of me very quickly,\nbecause I was too popular. It was kind of, like, piecemealing. And I remember I told him like,\n\"I don't know what to do.\" He said like, \"You don't\nhave to do anything. Just your safety comes first.\" And I said, \"But I can't. I mean, I've been doing\nthat for two years, and I cannot just like\nsay, 'bye-bye, guys.' I have a responsibility, I have a team. I have people working for me.\" And I also, I cannot just like disappear. And he said the most\ninteresting thing ever. And said, \"If you're afraid of something, make fun about the fact\nthat you're afraid of it instead of talking about that something.\" - [Lex] Brilliant, yeah. - So there was like a whole episode that we did not even mention Sisi. We did not even mention it, but the videos did all the thing. And the whole episode was me trying to avoid talking about him. And that how the comedy was created. The fact that I don't wanna be here. So he said like, you will be surprised how people can relate to that, because there was a lot of kind of, like, \"Oh, we love him, but we\nfeel we cannot speak.\" So just by doing the simple thing about mirroring the society,\nthat goes a long way. And I kind of try to do what\nI can under the military. I mean, they came up with\na machine that treats AIDS and hepatitis C virus and\nbasically every single, and I went to town with that. Because people think, it\ndoesn't really have to go to the bigger post,\nlike, you're an asshole. No, you talk about their propaganda. You talk about what they want people to perceive them at, and it's a failure. And for that, that kind\nof hit them even more. Because what do authoritarian figures do? They work on two things,\nfear and propaganda. And from that, it gets the respect. So when you go into their\npropaganda and expose them, they have nothing else. - That's brilliant. So like, you are walking on eggshells, but you're doing it masterfully, that you're revealing sort of\nthe flaws in the propaganda, the absurdity of the propaganda in so doing or criticizing them. - And this is why comedy is very specific. Because people say, \"You\nwere not as hard on him as you were on the Muslim.\" I was like, \"Yes, because\non the Muslim Brotherhood, we were just, like, saying\nshit to each other.\" - Yeah.\n- But now, the ceiling was, like, here. So, it's kind of, like, how\ncan you do something from here? - Yeah, exactly. That's the art form. Yeah, in the Soviet Union under Stalin, a lot of the criticism came\nfrom, like, children stories and children's cartoons.\n- Yeah. Double meaning. - Yeah.\n- Double innuendo stuff that means other stuff. - Real crazy.\n- That's the brilliance. - Yeah, but everyone knows.\n- Everyone knows. - Because you are like,\nyou're mirroring the society. It's fascinating actually. - And that's why I was canceled twice. (both laugh) - And that is a scary one, the army. You see that in Ukraine. - Yeah.\n- Everybody supports the army. That's why Zelenskyy\ngetting rid of the head of the army was a big, big deal. It's a really dangerous thing, 'cause everyone's afraid\nto say anything negative about the army, especially\nduring war in that case. And in this case, maybe\nthere's a civil war, that kind of thing.\n- But think about it. Actually, an army during\npeace is much more dangerous. Because think about it, I don't really have an enemy to fight, but I have all of this\npower, all of this tank. Why is this actually\nhave more money than me? - Yeah.\n- I'm protecting him. Why does this businessman think that he can get onto his\nprivate plane and go to Paris? And why I'm here sitting like, not having all of these things? And there's a lot of time on your hand, because your job is to go fight. When you don't go fight and\nwhen you have the lack of, that's why that's one of the thing I love the United States about, is the fact that the army\ncannot really get power. But the kind of, like,\nthe power is actually in the military industrial complex, which is a different issue. - Yeah.\n- It's kind of, like, a different kind of issue. But if you have all of that power, like, why am I sitting around just, like, playing guard for you guys? - That's why Iran is terrifying, 'cause you have this military that it just becomes a\npolice force that turns against its own people.\n- Yeah, yeah. - So you're a famous guy talking shit in the middle of all that. - Yeah, and when I left, I\nwent through a very dark side. Dark, dark, dark, because\nall of the insecurities, all of the stuff that had been, like, working on my head now came to life. And now, I'm in America and I'm a nobody. - Yeah.\n- I'm a nobody. And now, it's like, I\nhave to do something. I have to earn some money. So I started to stand up\ncomedy five years ago. - Yeah.\n- And I sucked, because it was my second\nlanguage and I was new. And now, I would go to these\ncomedy clubs with, like, kids and 21, 22 people,\nand I'm there with a family to support, and I'm going\nthere to do it for $15, $20. And I was bad, I was bad. - You're bombing.\n- Bombing big time. - Eating shit.\n- Eating shit big time. Dying up there big time. And I would go back home and I would cry. And then what made it worse\nis sometimes like, a fan. - Yeah.\n- Like, not a fan. A bunch of fans from Egypt. Oh, Bassem Youssef, they come, it's like. (Lex laughs) - Yeah, just the-\n- The disappointment. That kind of, like, face of adoration. - Yeah, yeah.\n- Like, that goes into. (both laugh) And I could see it in their face. - Yeah.\n- I think he's gonna drive an Uber in a couple of weeks. (laughs) That kind of pressure. And I would go and I would cry, and then essentially, \"Oh, you left. You gave up, you were a\nsellout, you're a coward. Why don't you speak from\nabroad? You are safe now.\" I already spoke. I don't want to be, 'cause I\ndon't wanna be an activist. I was doing that for comedy\nwhen it was good for everybody. But now, they want me to go into YouTube and just like, throw rocks from outside. I was like, you do not\nunderstand I have family there. - Yeah.\n- And it was this kind of, like, thing, like, that I am being, like, attacked for not doing what I\nshould do in their face and attacked for not being\nfunny and not doing good. And now, I'm afraid\nlike, maybe it was wrong. And I didn't know, it was so traumatic that I don't know actually how\nI went through these years. And I blocked so many\ndetails from my brain, because I have been using\nthis technique for a while now that there is a lot of\nmemory gaps in my brain. And I'm trying to suppress it, because it was very, very, very traumatic. And a lot of people told me,\n\"You have to go to therapy.\" But I don't know, I'm worried\nto open the floodgates. And I'm thinking, as if as I'm functional and I'm not killing anybody, I'm okay. (both laugh) - I think Elon tweeted, \"Never Went to therapy is\ngonna be on my headstone.\" - Yeah. (both laugh) - So you're of best buds, okay. I mean, that is, like,\nterrifyingly difficult to like, after being a surgeon,\nafter being a superstar, super famous, going to eat\nshit at local tiny clubs in the United States. I mean, eating shit, period.\n- Yeah. - Like, bombing is really,\nreally, really difficult, really difficult for 20-year olds. - Imagine when you're 45, 46, and then people's like, \"Is\nthis his midlife crisis? What is the...\" (both laugh) I went through a lot of\npain and a lot of, like, the doubts, and it was terrible. - I mean, how did you survive? I mean, I know you blocked off most of it, but what gave you, like,\nstrength through all that? - Because I didn't have any other choice. Because I started that, and the only reason that\nI could is continue. I don't know what else to do. I don't wanna go back to medicine. I don't want to do that. And I don't know, and\nbit by bit, bit by bit, I started to kind of, like, be\nbetter, be better, be better. And I was at a certain time,\na year ago, a year ago, this is where I started to kind of, like, hone the craft and kind\nof sell more tickets, and sometimes even sell out some shows, and sometimes sell a theater. So like, it was going, and the money was flowing and it was good. And then I was like, I want\nit faster. I want it more. I want it now. I want\nNetflix deal, and whatever. And then the Piers Morgan thing happened, and then I blew up. And then suddenly I'm\nselling out to everywhere. And it's like, \"Ah, if those people came, if the war happened two years\nago, I will not be ready.\" So now, they come to the\nshow, and by the way, my show had nothing to\ndo with the October 7th. My show is my thing that I've\nbeen crafting and working on. You know how difficult\nit's to do the first hour, the hour that I've been\nworking on for five years. And it's all my personal story, all about like, what\nhappened to me in Egypt, me as an immigrant, coming\nhere to the United States, finding Trump as a president, finding myself in the\nmiddle of a guns rally, finding myself in the middle of a bombing. Kind of, like, talking about\nhow I got my citizenship. It's like, funny stories\nabout, like, my origin story. So they come in and they\nexpect me to October 7th, and all they see is my personal story. But it's good, and it\nkills and they love it. It's like, if that kind of,\nlike, blew up in America, happened to me two, three years ago, people would come and be disappointed. - I gotta say the timing of\nOctober 7th is very suspicious. - Oh, my God. Please don't say that. - I don't know. I'm just asking questions, I don't know. - I'm telling you, one\nof the funniest thing. A guy, I was in Dubai and\nlike a TV anchor came to me. \"Bassem Youssef, he flourishes\nduring revolutions and war.\" I was like, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, what? Dude! You're making me sound like\na bad omen, a very bad omen.\" - Yeah, you, Hamas, and Bibi together orchestrated all of this.\n- Oh, my god. That's the trilogy. (laughs) - You guys should go on the road together. I'm telling you that phone call is coming. - Yeah, but Hamas has to open. (both laugh) - And that would really bomb, right? - That would really bomb. (both laugh) - Oh, I love dark humor. You do a show, like, you were saying, in English and in Arabic. And the story is very different. - Totally different,\ntwo different stories. - I would love to just\nthe language difference, because it's the music of the\nlanguage is also different. So like, how can you\nconvert it into words? But what's the difference in\nthe music of the languages? - I'll tell you, because\nI thought about a thought. (both laugh) - All right, all right, all right. - Okay, so, when I was\ndoing the English first. - Yeah.\n- I actually had good jokes, but I was missing the\ndelivery, because the cadence and the music and the rhythm is different. The way that an English speaking Americans member of audience will receive it, it will be different\nthan how I receive it, the energy, everything's different. So when I kind of, like, got it, I didn't know how to\nswitch back to Arabic. - Oh, wow, yeah, fascinating. - Because here's the thing, with English stand up comedy, you have a huge library,\nyou have, like, a legacy. You have, like, years and years and years and years of people doing comedy. But in Arabic, it's very new to us. And most of the Arabic standup comedy, especially in Egypt, is very tamed. This is kind of, like, imagine\nthe standup comedy scene in American 1960s before Lenny Bruce. - Oh, so no swearing, conservative, careful.\n- No swearing, nothing. Conservative, everything\nkind of, like, not yet. It's kind of like very... So I didn't know what to do there. So I broke the barriers. I became Lenny Bruce,\nI became George Carlin. So I went in and I\nchanged the whole thing. - Seven words you're not allowed to say. - For me, they're 15 words. (both laugh) - That's a lot.\n- A lot. Arabic is a very rich language. - [Lex] Yeah. - So when I did, here's the difference between the Arabic and the English show. The English show, surprise, surprise, is a unifying language\neven for a group of Arabs. So if I give the same exact show to the same 1,000 audience\nmembers in the same theater, and they're the same people, same makeup of, like, Lebanese,\nEgyptian, Syrian, Saudis, English will be a unifying language. Arabic is a dividing language. - Why is that?\n- Because you have 22 dialects and the dialects are vastly different. And like, maybe Egyptians understand a little bit of Lebanese,\nbut not that much. But the reference is\nAlgerian, Moroccan, Tunisian, totally different animal. That's like a totally different language. Saudi, Emirati, Kuwaiti,\ntotally different. People understand the Egyptian dialect, because it's the dialect of most of the artwork and the movies. But the reference in\nthe everyday street talk might not be understood by them. So now, I have to go in and talk to all of\nthese dialects together. So I formed my big part\nof my show is like, what are you guys expecting of this? When I go do profanity\nand you're gonna like it, this is the problem with\nthat, the show as a dialect, and I construct all of these sentences formed of so different, different words. For example, an iron in any\nArab dialect is an iron. In Saudi Arabia, it means ass. That's one example.\n- Yeah. - That's one example, you know? So imagine if you can\nactually construct sentences having all of these things in one set. So I would construct, like, a whole section of my show about that. - So it's really very much about, like, self-reflective on language and the limits of language that's allowed. - And the limits of language, and I tell them part of the show is like, I know what's the problem\nwith me doing Arabic. It's like, if this was an English show and I was telling you\nfucking shit and bitch, you'll be, ha-ha-ha. But if I do one swear word,\nall of you will scream. - [Lex] Yeah. - It's like, why?\n- That is fascinating. - Is it because we are ashamed? - Yeah.\n- So it's kind of, like, it's not just, like, about\nswearing, it's about like, there's a lot of philosophical\npathways in this. Yeah, there is profanity, and people have fun, whatever, but like, it is about, like,\nhow do we treat our language? And I tell them, we speak Arabic as Arabs, but it's not the same Arabic. It's crazy, right? - And you're doing the\nshow in America also, which is another level of- - Oh, yeah, actually, the\nArab diaspora in America is some of the best audiences I have. They are, like, wonderful. And I did it also in the Middle East. And maybe I'll do, like, an Arab tour in the Middle East in the fall. - Which countries would you go to and not? - I already did Jordan, Lebanon. I'm doing UAE, I'm doing Kuwait. - Egypt?\n- Bahrain. Egypt, I don't think so. I don't think so. - Is it personal? Is it\nworry about your safety? - Well, I have the American\ncitizenship right now, so I am relatively safe. There is a block.\n- Sure. - Honestly, there's a block.\n- Yeah. - There's so much that happened. And I will never badmouth Egypt. This is my country. Like, it has all of my memories, 40 years of my life I lived there. But when you get hurt so much,\ninstead of trying to kind of, I don't wanna take revenge,\nI don't wanna, like, battle. I just want to avoid, because\nEgypt gave me so much fame and so much love and so much\nhate and so much rejection. It was a very tumultuous relationship. Very, very difficult. And a lot of people tell me,\n\"Well, don't you miss Egypt?\" And I tell them every time, the Egypt that I miss\nis not there anymore. It's not bad or good,\nit's not worse or better. It's just I'm different. And the places are different\nand the people are different and their circumstances are different. Whatever image that you have of what you love is not there anymore. That's why a lot of immigrants,\nespecially Arab immigrants, they live here, but they're there. And then when they go back for a vacation, they get disappointed, because they didn't find what they want. And then they come back here\nand they're disappointed, because this is they wanna come back, but it's not there anymore. - Yeah, their view of that\nplace is from a different time. You know, my parents, but everybody that left the Soviet Union, I mean, it's such a complicated\nrelationship with that. It sometimes borders on\nhate, disappointment. In the case of the Soviet\nUnion, perhaps similar to Egypt, is the promises sold when you were younger and the promises broken by the possibility of what it was supposed to be. With the Soviet Union, I'm\nsure with Egypt it's the same. Iran is the same. So they have a very complicated\nrelationship with that. - Yeah, this is why, like, for example, people from Iran, you know, I remember. I remember quite well the World Cup that was done in the United States. And the Iranian team\nwere playing in America. And they were people in the\naudience all wearing Iran. They hate the regime, but they\nhave this kind of connection with the country.\n- Yeah, yeah. - And this is the whole thing. You can actually love the country and you not have to agree with the regime. - Would you ever perform in the West Bank? - No.\n- Gaza? - Because if I go there, I have to go through\nthe Israeli checkpoints, and I don't wanna go through the Israeli. I don't want to have an Israeli soldier telling me what to do. - Yeah, there's a demeaning\naspect to that whole. - Very.\n- Even in subtle ways, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. I mean, I have so many Palestinian friends with an American passport,\nUS passports, living here. They're born here, and they\ntalk about the humiliation and the intimidation and the\nharassment that they go in. It's like, do you want me to try? - Yeah, that little bit of a humiliation. - A little bit. - Oh, sometimes, it's major. - I know, I know.\n- But I noticed that, you know, even the little bit\nhas, after a lifetime of that, it can turn to hate towards the other. - [Bassem] Yeah, and resentment. - Resentment, and then how do you do anything\nwith that resentment? - I have a friend of mine, he is from Palestine, from the West Bank. He's American here, he is born here. And we talk about, you know, we have, of course, all of this\ndiscussion of what happened. And he tells me, you\nknow, in October 11th, in the West Bank, and there\nwas a village called Qusra. And on that village, like, the settlers went\nin around the village and they send a message on Facebook. It was like, \"You rats,\nget out of your sewers and we're gonna be waiting for you.\" Intimidation through technology. And then, Qusra have,\nlike, another settlement next to it called Esh Kodesh. Esh Kodesh, they have people there who were training something\ncalled (speaks in Arabic), Which is basically the guardians of Isha. And it's like a paramilitary group that trains other settlers\non military combat, give them weapons and do,\nlike, military drills. And they went there, like,\nmilitarized and went there, and it was actually co-founded\nby a Jew from Brooklyn, not even, like, an Israeli. And he's, like, one of the\ndisciples of Meir Kahane. I'm sure that you know who Meir Kahane is, who was a Jewish defense lead. The people who assassinated Alex Odeh here in the United States. And they were there with\ntheir weapons outside intimidating people. This story carries everything that is wrong with the situation. You have people from\nBrooklyn, from outside, just because they're Jewish, they can come and they can claim the\nland from the people there. Anybody from (indistinct), just because he's Jewish, you can come and take the\nland from other people. They're using technology\nto intimidate Palestinians. They have unchecked military power. These are not IDF soldiers,\nthese are settlers. And they have free reign\nin order to intimidate and to kill the people. And you understand, this is\nthe daily life of Palestinians, not in Gaza, in the West Bank. - What do we do, what do people do to nudge this towards\npeace, towards flourishing? - Here's the thing, I wanna\ntalk to the people of Israel. What is Israel doing right now is not just unfair to the Palestinians, it's unfair to the\nJewish people in Israel. No, it is unfair to the Jewish\npeople around the world, because the way that Israel\nlinks itself to the Judaism, at a certain point, you know, remember like Isis and Al-Qaeda and when everybody hated Muslims? You know, sometime, humans are simple. They cannot have the nuances to separate. So anybody who with a Muslim name, with a Muslim face, with\na beard or looks Muslim, he would do it because of that\nactions of those atrocities. You have the power as a\nperson to separate yourself from an abusive power, a\nhorrible power and be yourself. I am really worried because\nthe rise of antisemitism and the rise of hate against Jews is not because of the Jews. It's because of the\nactions of a government. Jews do not have to be\non the side of apartheid. Ronnie Kasrils, he is\na Jewish South African, and he fought shoulder to\nshoulder next to Nelson Mandela. He was part of the African\nNational Conference, ANC. And he had an article say like,\n\"I know what apartheid is, and I saw Israel and\nthis is what they have.\" And the thing is that Israeli government should listen to other people. You cannot call anybody who criticize you either an anti-Semite, or\nif they're already Jewish, you call them, like, self-hating Jew. You cannot do that, you\ncannot continue doing that. When I would go in and criticize\nthe Islamist, it was like, \"Oh, you're self-hating Muslim. You're not really Muslim. You're an infidel, you're secret, you're a secular, whatever.\" We have the power in\norder to reform the course by holding people in power accountable. And the thing is, it is very stupid to actually call this antisemitism. And like, my idol is Jon Stewart. I voted for Bernie Sanders. (laughs) Sara Taksler, the one who\ndid this amazing documentary about me, \"Tickling Giants,\" she's a Jew. She's married to an Israeli Jew. We have a good ratio because\nwe know what the right is. They don't have to associate themselves with the action of the Israeli government. - One of your favorite words, jihad. (Bassem laughs) - That's my favorite hobbies. - It's his favorite hobby.\n- It's in my shows. Like, what's his favorite? It's that I talk about like, how when a white shooter does something, he talks about all of his family. And I'm always like, what if we did this,\nlike, for Arab terrorists? What are his hobbies? Jihad. (both laugh) You see, you could be a comedian. - Yeah, wow! You're making me feel good, okay. Sam Harris has done\nseveral episodes on jihad, and people should go listen to it, even if you disagree with it. But the basic idea that he's\nproposing is that this idea of jihad, in a negative\nconnotation of it, of martyrdom, is the thing that gets\nis counterproductive, is destructive to the\npossible future flourishing of Palestinian people. What do you think of that? There's just the idea of martyr- - Yeah, I totally agree, but like, people don't\nwake up in the morning and say like, I wanted to clear jihad. Think about it. Why would anybody choose to end his life by taking other people\nwith him and end that life? His life must be miserable,\nhe must be pushed into that. Nobody chooses death over life willingly. One of the first suicide bombers in the Palestinian\nresistance were Christians. We don't talk about that. - I think he would say that\nthe presence of a story that you can tell yourself when you're in a really shitty place, that you can go to a much better place. - Yeah.\n- By sacrificing your own life, just the\nfact that the presence of that story is there is harmful. - Of course. But here's my problem with Sam Harris. And usually, people will,\nthey have free range talking about the Islamic faith\nand nitpicking the stuff that makes it put in a bad light. I can go and nitpick\nevery single religion. There are Jews there that been here who openly say spitting on\nChristians is not a hate speech. All right? I mean, you can bring me,\nlike, all kind of videos of Islamic Jihadists saying\nhorrible things on YouTube, and I can bring you Jews who live there. They say like, \"We gonna\nhave the whole world enslaved for us and everybody would\nlove to be slave for the Jews.\" You know, I can use the Talmudic argument that if you tie a man to a tree and he dies of thirst and hunger, you didn't kill that man. And this is kind of the\nsame arguments like, \"Ah, we not killing Palestinians. It's just like killing man, and they were dying by\nthemselves,\" you know? So the nitpicking of a certain narrative, religious narrative, that is separate from the political context and\nwhat's happening right now, it's very unfair, because I can read. If you wanna have a deep\ndive into religious texts, nobody will be happy. And I can bring stuff from the Talmud and the Torah and stuff that is horrible. But like, you know, this is a way again of, like, distraction. - I dare you to talk about\nBuddhism and Jainism though. Try.\n- Well, you know, the people who killed\nthe Muslims in Myanmar, weren't they Buddhist?\n- Yeah. Well, let's go Jain. Okay, I'll find a little bit. I got to get back to you.\nI'll have to find the- - The flying monster. The Church of the Flying\nMonster is spaghetti. (laughs) - As a person who tries not to eat carbs, I'm deeply offended by that. - I mean, there's Scientologists, all they do is actually buy real estate. (both laugh) - I think there's a few books written about the fact that they\ndo other stuff as well. (Bassem laughs) So even there.\n- I know, I know. - Mormon, sometimes, they're some of the nicest\npeople I've ever met. - Yeah.\n- But I'm sure there's also darkness there too. Oh, boy, religion. - There's soaking in Mormon. - There's what?\n- Soaking. - What's soaking?\n- Okay. So soaking basically, like,\nif you get into the woman and you don't move, that's not adultery. That's not like... - Oh, interesting. So- - [Bassem] Yeah, you go\nin and you just stay. - There's a loophole. - There are loophole, that's\nthe thing about religion. There's a loophole.\n- Religion has a loophole. - Yes, and Muslims, we\ndo that the whole time. We pick and choose our sins,\nthe stuff that we enjoy. It's just, we are humans. - 72 versions waiting for all of us. - Maybe if I converted you\nas a Jew, I'll get you 80. I don't know, you know,\nlike, we can negotiate. - Right, but I also have\nquestions about whether- - It will be a very good deal. I'll give you, and maybe\nI'll throw there a Camry. - I have to honest,\nCamry, it's pretty good. What year? I don't know. - 1998.\n- All right. - Best year ever. (laughs) - Well, they last a long time.\n- Yeah. - So, I'm not sure I want '78, '72. - I'll throw five in the\nmix and see how we feel. - Yeah. Can we-\n- If you wanna upgrade. - [Lex] Can we do a trial period? But in general, if you just zoom out, do you think religion, in what way, is it good for the world\nand what way is it harmful? - If there was no religion, humans would have invented religion. Because think of, like,\nthe early humanity. Like, you are, like,\na caveman or whatever. And then, like, you see\nyour family members killed, and then you say, like, what? I'm gonna be like the sheep or the gazelle that just, like, ends in perish. I am more important. I think with the development\nof consciousness, humans, like, thought that\nthey are much more precious and important than the other animals, because they have now intelligence. So my life will not end like that. Death will be even more important. There's consequences for that. There's consequences for what I do. And then the early man was\nlike, they're in the desert and all of these, like,\nnatural phenomenon. They didn't know what\nto do, they were afraid. So they need to have refuge. They need to have\nsomething to take care of. They need to have a reason for everything. Because if there's no reason,\nit's chaos, it's chaos. - It's terrifying.\n- It's terrifying. It's terrifying, there's nothing. There has to be a reason. There has to be a reason,\nthere has to be a purpose. There has to be, like, a cause, something. I'm not just gonna be like, die like a cockroach being stepped on. And that's kind of,\nlike, part of it is ego. - The whole world rotates\naround you in a way. - It's the ego. So religion actually got a lot\nof it from humanity itself. Like, me, us, like, us being humans. And many religion is a\ncollection of stories. And those stories based on things that humans did themselves and\nthey attributed it to gods. - And there's an aspect of religion where you humble yourself before a thing that is much greater than you. So that has a, I would say, a very positive effect of humbling. - It will be great if it stopped there. - Yeah.\n- But here's the thing, if you humble in order\nthat your ego kicks in and feel that you are\nbetter than someone else who's not humble in front of the same God. - Don't go there. - That means that I will\nhave all of that trait that I can use that because now, what does mean being humble? I'm divine.\n- Yeah. So I'm way more humble than you. - Ah, but you're not. So you see how they kind\nof, like, the oxymoron. I'm humble and I'm surrendering,\nbut in the same time, I am better than you\nand I'm more entitled. Isn't it crazy? - Yeah, it's beautiful,\nit's crazy, absurd. - Look at like the Muslim,\nChristians and Jews and every like, it's like, \"All right, Muslims, we surrender.\" I mean, I'm talking\nabout the extreme ones. I mean, like people. So, I surrender to God,\ngood. Keep it that way. - Yeah.\n- Like, if you go there, I surrender to God, that\nmeans that I am closer to God, then you should die! - Yeah.\n- Okay, Christians. Christ is love and he loves\nme and we gonna be together, but you don't get into\nhis kingdom and you die. You see, it is the same thing. - [Lex] Yeah. Yeah. - It's just, if you-\n- Just stop it. - Like, stop there. Stop where you are humble and you feel that you're a piece of shit. - Yeah.\n- And you are worthless human being and you are there. - Yeah, yeah.\n- Stop there. But once you says like, oh, that makes me a\nbetter person than you, and it makes me more with God than you. So that would give me the\nentitlement to kick your ass. - Yeah, we always ruin a good thing. - Don't we? (both chuckling) - That ego. You've been outspoken, you\nknow, with Piers Morgan, but just on this topic, and you talked about the Superman story. Which I would love it if you\nwere in a Superman movie. But have you lost job\nopportunities because of this, because of speaking up? - There was a couple of things that were going on, but they stopped. Again, I don't know if October 7th. - The Superman story, just so- - Yeah, yeah.\n- So what role were you? - Okay.\n- What did you audition for? - Yeah, okay, okay, all right,\nall right, okay. (laughs) So in June, I was traveling to Dubai. And right an hour before I\nget into the car and go there, my manager is like, \"Bassem,\nI'm gonna send you a script. Read it, it's for Superman.\" It's like, oh, Superman, you know, I'm not really good in auditions.\nI'm not a seasoned actor. So I was like, \"Okay, I'm just\ngonna do it, send the tape.\" I do the tape, I send\nit, I go to the airport. And I think I can talk about it now, because they said they changed the script. So basically, what I found it interesting in that new script is that there is, like, a dictator in a country that\ninvades another country, and Superman interferes politically. That's the first time we ever see Superman\ninterferes politically. - Yeah.\n- So basically, it was like Russia and Ukraine. But because of me, it couldn't\nbe Russia and Ukraine. So it had to be something\nkind of, like, with a flavor. So I read the role as if as a\nmixture of Trump and Mubarak. (Lex laughs) I did this mix of, like, you know? I have, like, the kind of the Middle East. - Yeah.\n- But also like, kind of, like, the essence of Trump into it. I went to the airport, it's like an hour. It's like, James Gunn saw it, he loves it. What? I never had an audition that fast. I mean, I had a few roles, but\nnot that fast, not like that. And then I said like, well, the strike starts, like, tomorrow and we need to be on the phone. But after the strike, we cannot\ntalk, the SAG after strike, like, where the writers\nand the actors strike. So like, well, I'm gonna\nbe on a plane right now. He's like, \"Okay, once you land, you can have a Zoom call with James Gunn.\" I have a call with James Gunn. I'm a huge fan of him. The guy took, like, something like, \"Guardian of the Galaxy,\" nobody knew about it,\nmade amazing trilogy. And he is, like, a really cool guy. I like what he did. And it was like, really nice. And he started to talk\nto me about the movie. And you know, like, I talk to\npeople before casting them. So I know that everybody's\non set have a good chemistry. It was amazing. So in your mind, if you're an\nactor, what does that mean? You got the part, and he\ntold me, \"You got the part.\" Month goes by, strike goes\nby, October 7th happens. I do Piers Morgan, one and two, and then I go to my Australian tour. My manager called me,\n\"Bassem, the strike was over.\" He's like, \"You don't\nhave the part anymore.\" I was sad, very sad, but for three days. And I said like, I need to\nstand up with it, khalas. I'm actually doing very\nwell. (speaks in Arabic) And then when I went to Chris Cuomo, after I finished the show, he told me, \"Did you lose any opportunities?\" And that was off record, after the show was, like, we concluded. And I said, I talked about Superman, and I found myself when I\nwas talking, I was angry. - Yeah.\n- I was bitter, and I went home. I was like, \"Why was I\nangry? Why was I bitter? It wasn't meant to be. And\nI'm living a good life now. I don't need to\" So when I was asked again the next day in two different interviews, the BBC and another one was\nalong with my friend Dino, I said the story in a different way. I said, \"I don't have any anger. As a matter of fact, maybe\nif I was Warner Brothers,\" I didn't talk about James Gunn,\nI thought it was the studio. \"If I was Warner Brothers\nand I'm a Muslim, I wouldn't have, like, a Zionist or a pro-Israeli in my movie. But I want to tell them that like, when I criticize Israel, I am\nnot a threat to you as a Jew. And we can actually have more in common.\" I was more of a kind of empathic. So when I said that,\nthe internet went crazy. And you know, James Gunn have haters because, you know, the\nSnyderVerse and all of the, it's a word that I don't understand. And James Gunn, like, had\nall of these attacks on him. And I was pissed of how it was handled. I wasn't angry at James\nGunn, but I thought it was. So my publicist now mentions like, \"Bassem, stay calm, don't speak. It's better to, like, not talk about it.\" I said, okay. So there's nothing wrong about me, but I see the heat is\nrising against James Gunn. And that is a guy that I\nhad a personal connection even through Zoom, and I\ndidn't like what was happening. And then he called me\nand he explained to me. He says, \"Bassem, you\nknow, I actually use like, have camera tests before\npeople before finally\" I didn't know that. \"And then we changed the\nscript and it was the strike. So I didn't call.\" And also I thought to myself,\nI'm small, I'm a small actor. I'm not that important for him to call me to say we're gonna change the script. So I still think that, like, the timing sucks and everything. But then I went and I did a video explaining exactly what I'm telling you, because I didn't want to be famous for the wrong reasons.\n- Yeah. - Because that will be unfair. Because already, and I was\nhaving like interviews, \"Can you comment about Superman?\" I was like, \"Guys, that's it. I'm not gonna talk about it,\nbecause this is a non-issue.\" And when I talked to James on the phone, I felt how sincere he was. So I didn't want someone\nto, because of me, will have that kind of attack, because I know what it means\nto be on the other side of that kind of attack. It's terrible, and it ruins\nyour life and it ruins your day. And nobody deserves to be doing that. And I don't wanna be the reason for someone else to go through that pain. - And you also said that\nyou don't wanna be a victim. - Yeah, I don't want\nto be. I'm doing great. I'm selling out everywhere. I'm having a wonderful,\nloyal audiences coming to me. Why I would be angry about\nthe role of a Superman? Yes, it's great to be\nin the superhero movies, but so what, you know? - Wait, you know,\nthere's a wisdom in that. Even if you weren't doing great, that's a choice a lot\nof people can come to, which is like, do I\nplay victim here or not? - It's greed, it's greed. They want more attention. They want to be more into the thing. They want more and more, and there's so much to go around to be enough for all of us. But it is greed. It is ego, ego, ego, ego. I need to be in the center,\nI need to be victimized. I need people feel sorry\nfor me and love me. And it is not the right way. It is not, because it is fake. It is fake, it's made up. And I did not victimize\nmyself when I left for Egypt. I mean, now, I speak about it now. But in that dark times, I\nwas detained in airports. I didn't have my American passport yet. I was still traveling\nwith my Egyptian passport, and I was detained in an Arab airport. And I was going to be\ndelivered to the Egyptians. I had shows when I was still starting, I had hecklers being sent to\nme by the Egyptian embassy and Egyptian consulate\nin New York and in London to curse me and to take videos of that and then send it to\nstate-run media in Egypt. And I didn't speak about that, because I felt that, like,\nif I speak about that, I feel about like, what\nwas going on to me, I would be victimizing myself. It's like, if I'm gonna be good, I'm gonna good, because of what I do, not because of what people's perception of what I'm going through. - Yeah, and that becomes a slippery slope. And somehow victimizing yourself- - Goes to more victimizing.\n- Yeah. - And then you cannot leave that habit. You can only exist and thrive\nif people feel sorry for you. - Yeah, I mean, Israel\nand Palestine currently both have that temptation. - I would always push back\nwhen you do the comparison, because one of them is not\nreally in the same kind of power. I mean, yeah.\n- For sure, for sure. - So like, do you get the- - I mean, it is very easy to say why Palestinian will victimize themselves. But Israel, with all\nof that military might, man, it's too much. What Israel is doing is that they're victimizing the Jewish experience. And I don't think it is\nfair for a lot of Jews. I don't think that they\nshould use the Holocaust and the persecution that happened to Jewish people all through history in order to push an\nequally oppressive agenda. That is not fair, and it's not good for\nthe Jewish people living. And it is basically a disrespect to the memory of the Holocaust. I told you I wanna make a movie\nabout the Holocaust, I do. Because what happened was that kind of engineered torture\nshould never happen again. And it should not be happening now. - So to you, what Israel\nis doing is leading to more antisemitism in the world? - A 100%, and I think, and I know, can I be a conspiracy\ntheorist for a second? - Please, the earth is\nflat, we all know this. - A part of me thinking maybe they're doing that intentionally, because if there's a rise\nof antisemitism in Jews, there will always like points,\nlike, see, they hate us, so we can do whatever we want. Because you see, if we let go\nof our might and our strength, we're gonna go back to\nthe concentration camps, because you see how the word hates you. - And again, when you say\nthey are people in power. - Yeah, oh, yeah, absolutely. Listen, it's always the people in power. I believe that humans\nare easily corruptible and easily repairable, but the corrupted part is much easier. But people could change, but power, people in power are very dangerous. Very, very dangerous. Especially if you have religion,\nwhich is power by itself. Military might, political\nsupport, and money. Dude, that's a very, very,\nvery dangerous recipe. - You know, all that said, I do believe in the\npower of the little guy, the individual to overthrow\nthe government, you know? I don't know if you heard, but the Arab Spring\nwill, you know, happens. Just among friends.\n- We are Americans, right? - Yes.\n- We're Americans. - Yeah, allegedly.\n- We're Americans. (both laugh) - How funny is that? Like, just given our two backgrounds, we're Americans.\n- We're Americans. We're Americans. It's like... (both laugh) We're Americans. There's one thing about, like, the power of the little guy\nthat I am very sad about. Because you see, I love\nAmerica by the way. I consider it my new home. And I want my kids to grow up here. I am very grateful for the opportunity that I have in the United States. And I criticize the\nUnited States politics, and I criticize it out of love, the same way that I was criticizing what's happening with Egypt out of love. What is worrying for me is how the power of the little man is diminishing. It doesn't matter now who\ndo you vote into power, they will not listen to you. They would listen to the people\nwho paid them to be there. And it is very concerning, because I can see the\nAmerican democracies turning, not even slowly, very\nrapidly into an oligarchy. If I'm sure that all of\nthe millions of people who are voting, they\ndon't vote for the NRA. They don't vote for APAC. They don't vote for the\npharmaceutical companies. They don't for vote for the\nmilitary industry complex. And yet, the people in\npower, they come in, they take your vote and my vote, and they're loyal to\nthose people, not to us. And it is very, very, very\nconcerning, very concerning. And this is the danger\nof the American policies, or American politics and\nAmerican democracies. It is dangerous because\nbasically the vote becomes just like a ceremony, that\nsomeone with the more, like, funding will get to power, and then he is not loyal to you. - So the fire, I mean, we are in Texas. Everybody's armed to the teeth here. - Yeah, but like, what are these arms gonna\ndo in front of tanks? - Well, you said the American military is unique in this way. - I know, but for now. - For now, the tanks are, first of all, I believe\nRussia has more tanks than the United States\ntanks, I don't know. You know, I'm not an expert in military strategic deployment of arms, but the United States uses\ndifferent kinds of weapons. - They have drones and\nthey have the lasers, and they're sitting\ncomfortably behind the screens. It's kind of, like, it\nturns like, a big Xbox game. - Yeah, and they sell a lot\nof those things to everybody. - It's crazy because the defense budget is 68% of American military. It's like, almost $850 billion each year. And most of that weapons\nwe don't even need it. - Yeah.\n- We just do it because of the contracts. There was, like, an incredible 60 minutes, I'm sure that you saw it. The one about, like, the\ngouging of the prices of the Department of Defense. It was one of the most fascinating things that I've ever seen. They said like, a valve, a safety oil valve that\nused to be sold for $329. Now it is sold for $9,000. Why? Because there's only\nfive weapon companies, and they can control the prices. And in 2006, the whole Apache fleet of the American army in Iraq was grounded, because there is one valve\nthat they were, like, gouging the price and\ndidn't wanna give them. The stinger missile, that's\njust like, the missile, the one that you carry, and then it's like the anti-aircraft, it used to be sold for $25,000. Now it's sold for $400,000. And nobody is doing that, you know why? Because the DoD has fired 130,000 people, including engineers and negotiators. So now in order to cut expenses, now we're paying more money. And the thing is, we do\nnot have a say in this. We do not have a say in how my tax money and your tax money is being spent. Because I'm sure you don't want your money to be sent to Israel like that. I'm sure, even if you're Jewish, I'm sure. I'm sure that, like, I don't want my money to be given to some Muslim countries who kill other Muslims, I'm sure. But it is not, here's the thing, what kind of power do we\nhave other than speaking? So what is left for us is free speech. And now when you speak,\nthey call you anti-Semitic. You see why I'm angry? (laughs) - But still, I mean, America's\nholding pretty strong despite the criticisms\non the free speech front. But if you look at the\nfreedom of the press, freedom of the speech index,\nAmerica is not at the top. - It is not, and this is why, for example, it is very disheartening for me to see that the Western media, Western press, that used to be the beacon of freedom are now using as mouthpieces. And it is funny how the New York Times, Nixon got angry in the\nNew York Times in 1971 when they found leaks about him lying about the Vietnam War since the beginning. And now, he hired the plumbers, you know, the special units in orders\nto go in and find the leaks. This was Watergate basically, because he was angry\nto see who leaked that, instead of fixing the problem. Now the New York Times\nhave published this story about the rape that was a hoax, that was written by Anat Schwartz, who someone who have no experience. And now when it was leaked, instead of them correcting\nthemselves, they went in and they had their own\ninvestigation to see who leaked. The New York Times in\n2003 became the mouthpiece of George W. Bush of the WMD. And now, as an American, I\nsee that the New York Times is becoming a mouthpiece\nof a foreign country. Why do you do that? - One of the things\nthat's really difficult to know is where to find the truth. It does seem that both\nsides use propaganda and both sides lie a lot. - Both sides as in? - Both Israel and Palestine,\npro-Palestine and pro-Israel. There's a lot of lies. - I know, but... - [Lex] I think you're- - It's a lot of inequality, man. There is like a lot of\npeople on the internet, but like, who have the\nmainstream media siding with? - Yeah, but you know,\nthanks to social media- - Yes, thank God for social media, because now it's\nindividuals, they're people. - Yes.\n- They're people. You're comparing BBC, New York Times, Washington Post, World Street Journal with just people with a TikTok account. - Yeah, who has more power in your view? - Now, it is actually\nvery, very fascinating to see the little man having\nthat power over the media. - Yeah, in fact, disproportionately so, like, this is my problem. - But you cannot call people\nwith TikTok propagandists while people being paid\nto give you the news and they deliberately lie to you. - Yes, I can, they're both propagandists. - Well, okay, yes, yes. But like, the mechanism and\nthe intentions are different, because here's the thing. - I'd rather have the TikTok guy than the- - Like, the TikTok guy is\na TikTok guy, all right? But if you have the New\nYork Times being exposed to be lying and then they\nget this, like, UN report, which is, like, a disgrace. And you just put the title\nand you don't talk about it. Like, I'm fine with CNN and Jake Tapper and all of those people, like, spreading the rape allegations for years. I don't even want them to refute them. I want them to bring the Israeli reports saying that it didn't happen. The Israeli media themselves,\nthey didn't even bother. Not once, is that balanced? That's not.\n- Yeah. - So that's why people in TikTok, and because they have to take\nmatters in their own hand. - Yeah, but the problem\nwith the people in TikTok is the drug, the dopamine rush\nof getting a lot of likes. So instead of talking about\nthe death of civilians, they'll talk about beheaded babies or the equivalent of.\n- Yeah, yeah. - They're going to\nactually make up stories, because the made up stories\nare going to be more viral. And so now we're just in this\nscene, this muck of lies. - And there's a lot of people who actually expose those lies on TikTok. So you have both.\n- Sure. - You have both. And it's the kind of, like, the democracy of the social media as we always call it. But if you have the state-run media, that is the legacy media, CNN, BBC, New York Times, Fox\nNews, all of those people, and they are, like, spreading lies, and they're not even doing\ntheir journalistic job in order to at least bring the other side. - Yeah.\n- That's problematic. - And that's worse, you're\nsupposed to be journalists. - Yes, it's supposed\nto be reports, reports. - Yeah.\n- You know, report? - Yeah, but, you know, I see that this is like a catalyst, an inspiration for the citizen\njournalists to rise up. - This is what you're doing. - Oh, this? Yeah. - This is what you're doing. No, this is what you're doing, because you go into the deep dive. - Yeah.\n- This is, like, a no filter thing, there's no spin. - The long form, the long\nform is gonna save us. (Bassem laughs) - I see why you hate the TikToks, like, a dopamine rush. - Stupid TikTok, five hours later- - I saw the resentment\nin your face. (laughs) - I can't look away. - Like, those 30 seconds,\nI do four hours. (laughs) - I mean, both have a place. Both are exciting and,\nyou know, but I can't, it is very dangerous. Like, you can't look away.\n- Yeah. - And I almost never,\nmaybe I'm doing it wrong, but I almost never feel better ever after having used TikTok. - Makes two of us, I\ncan't, I cannot, I cannot. I have a team, by the way, I give my password to, like, a team. I don't even go there, because I went, I once, in a\ndark night, very late at night, I went to TikTok and\nit was like, two hours. What?\n- Yeah. - What? I said, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, this is dangerous. I'm really, like, an\nInstagram and Facebook guy. I don't need that. - Well, even there- - And I barely get out of Twitter. I mean, like X, I don't, I can't. X is a cesspool. X, it's just, like, the\nconcentrated hate in X is too much. It's too much, I can't. - [Lex] So, you don't check it at all? Or you try not to check it at all? It is very intense. - I don't, I don't, I don't at all. I can't, I can't.\n- Yeah. - I just like, I post something and I run. (both laugh) - Post and ghost. So you're doing comedy here in\nthe United States right now? - Yes. - Joe Rogan has the Comedy Mothership, which is an incredible club. Have you considered doing that club? - I would love to.\n- Do you know Joe? - Of course, who doesn't know Joe? - I feel like it's a small\nworld of comedy. That's why I- - No, I think, like, Joe's story was like, what he did and stuff\nthat he did in the UFC and his podcast, and it's very impressive. The fact that he's there and he's bringing all of those people, whether they're in comedy or\nhis podcast is very impressive. And this is what is\nthe media is all about, what is, like, the internet is all about, to give you the experiences of stuff that you might never experience. And that is very important. I mean, you do it with people with, like, you go into their brains. He goes take people and\nthey take their experiences and their lives and their stories. It's very interesting. And this is the beauty of that art form, because you have all of these experiences at the tips of your hands. And it is there for you\nto learn from, you know? And what he's doing, like,\nand when he moved to Texas and we did the Comedy Mothership, anybody who would, like,\npush comedy forward, that is the most difficult art\nform and the most demanding. And the fact that you do that, and he might not even be\nmaking money out of it, but he doing that because of\nhis passion, that is enough. - Yeah, he really believes\nin creating this, like, place where comedians\ncould be really free. And one of the cool things\nabout the Comedy Mothership is, like, comedian is king there. - Yeah.\n- Like, you have to bow down to the-\n- Because you know, the comedian who came there\ncame after, like, eating shit. Dying out there.\n- Yeah, eating shit. Everywhere else.\n- If you fit, you are, basically, you're a saint. (laughs) - I have eaten shit for many years. - Now I'm gonna give you shit. (laughs) - Ah, it's great. You already told me what\nyou think about the state of politics in the United States. But now, tell me what you really think. (Bassem laughs) What do you think of the\nchoice of Trump versus Biden? How did we end up here?\n- I don't know, man. I mean, like, the fact that like, you have two people over the age of 90. - Yeah.\n- It is- - I think it's over 100,\nbut that's all right. - All combined, like, a 170. It is so sad. It is so sad that this is what\nwe can produce as a society. Like, a demagogue and a sleepy Joe. He's not there, man. He's gone, he's gone. I mean, he could, you know, like, when old people could be\nlike a danger for themselves? He's a danger for the whole world. I mean, like, if an old person would die who would like, you know,\nhave, like, a hip replacement, we can need them at, like, a new planet because of one decision. But it's not just that, it's not that. When I came here, listen, I'm a Democrat. I always like, and I told you, like, I vote for Bernie Sanders. I supported him, like, 2016,\nbut I couldn't vote then. And of course, a huge fan of Obama. And one of my methodology is like, he's the first Muslim president. It's like, but he killed Muslims. Like, ah, that's things Muslims do. But anyways. (both laugh) - I love that line. - I think the whole\nidea, like, my shock is, I told you about, like, what Biden said about like, I'm a Zionist. Okay, we are a Zionist. But then like Jews are not safe\nanywhere other than Israel. It's like, dude, what\nthe hell are you saying? And if you don't care about me and you don't care about my misery, why would I care about you\nwinning or losing, you know? And I have a joke that\nI told people, like, why would even Biden listen to us? He just raised $145 million in California alone\nfrom pro-Israeli groups. I mean, what can we Arabs working in the vape business do to him? (both laugh) It's like, we cannot compete with that. I mean, like practically, I\nmean, it's like, life is unfair. The guy is a politician. He needs bills to pay. He needs a campaign to\nrun, he needs money. He will go to the people\nwho will give him money. Joe Biden is the highest paid politician from Israeli lobbyists,\n$4.6 million over the years. - Yeah, but I also\nbelieve in great leaders that go against all of that. But unfortunately, you know? - Bernie Sanders was like that. - Bernie Sanders, yes. But also age, I don't wanna be ageist. - Of course, of course, no, no. - But even with like,\n'cause I remember listening to Bernie Sanders 20 years\nago on Thom Hartmann show. And I don't wanna say\nanything against Bernie, but like, he was sharper then. - Of course.\n- There's a thing with age where-\n- Yeah, of course, no, I think I'm a huge fan about,\nlike, putting the limits on your working years, because\nyou don't wanna have, like, a Mitch McConnell moment every now, because now the whole thing\ngot like, what is this? Is this not like a hospice care home? It is unfair, it is unfair. And that the whole idea that you have, like, you have a limit for the president, but you don't have limit for congress people and senators. What do you mean? This is basically, you can go in and be in governance forever. And you know, the longer that you can get, the more corrupt you'll get. - Yes, that's the thing. - And that is very\nconcerning for Americans. - Everybody, everybody\nbecomes corrupt after. - Yeah.\n- I mean, that's why two terms is a good limit. - For Everybody.\n- Yeah. And you know, maybe half a\nterm for Egyptian leaders. - Well, you know, our half\nterm is 15 years. (laughs) - Quarter term. (Bassem laughs) You should come back and\nrun for office there. - Oh, my God, no, no. There's a curse in Egyptian presidency. Nobody comes there like,\neither all dead or in jail. - Yeah. - It's not the most appealing job. - They might make a statue of you though. Make you look good. - After my death. (laughs) I look very good dead in the statue. - Yeah, when you look at\nwhat happened when Navalny, since you kind of really\nthought about this in Egypt, what happened with Navalny in Russia? What do you think about that? - Yeah, but what happened\nwith Navalny in Russia is not something new in Russia. I mean, Putin have,\nlike, this whole history of poisoning and killing people. And it's kind of, like, pretty much, I would have to cite credit to Putin. He's, like, bringing us the essence of the dark ages, the middle ages. It's like, you know, like,\nbasically Putin is like, is the living example of what happens if \"Game of Thrones\" was reality. It's like death by poison. Like, I'll blow up a plane. It's like, mysteriously\ndisappears. (laughs) It is very dark, but it's like, wow! It's a television show. - Maybe that's what attracts\nus to that part of the world is that it's so much on display, this game of power, of geopolitics. - Yeah.\n- Of war. - No, but the same happens in the West, but behind closed doors. - Yes.\n- It's not that open. - Not pronounced.\n- It's not that pronounced. You know, it's like, oops, Epstein. - Yeah, yeah. (Bassem laughs) - It's like, oh! I think because of the\nWest is more advanced, like in movies and cinemas,\nwe kind of direct it better. - Yeah.\n- I think the outcome's like, the way that you kind\nof, like, set the scene, it's like, hm, scene and scene. - That's why people are about\nlike landing on the moon. They're like, ah!\n- Yeah! (both laugh) - I get it, but you know,\nwe haven't gone back. - The earth is flat, huh, maybe? - All right, if we zoom out, do you think there will\nalways be war in world? - Yeah.\n- Always be suffering, yes? - Yeah, but here's the thing,\nI don't think for long. I don't think that will happen further. - Wait a minute. - Yeah.\n- Yeah? - Because here's the thing. Humanity is destined to\nhave war, it will have war. But something happened\nin the last 50 years. Now we have much more lethal weapons. The problem is at the beginning, it's like swords against\nswords, horses, cavalier, like, cannons, catapults, mini missiles. But now, we're like, you know,\nlike, a press of a button, you can annihilate the whole planet. - Yeah.\n- And this is the problem. Wars will always continue. The problem is when is\ngonna be the tipping point where we are actually\ngoing to destroy ourselves. And it is so easy now\nto destroy ourselves. The amount of weapons and the quality of weapons that we have, it is designed to kill more\neffectively, it is crazy. It's like, we can create our\nown destruction on ourself. And I think we're not\nthat far away from it. - Just looking at nuclear weapons, the fascinating thing\nabout nuclear weapons is I've gotten to learn recently just how few people are involved\nin a full on nuclear war that kills, basically, kills everybody. - Yeah.\n- Well, three plus billion people right away. - And the consequences of the nuclear winter, it's unlivable. - But all it takes is, I\nmean, one president can do it. So it could be even a false\nalarm, misunderstanding. - Like, what happened in\nthe Cuba Missile Crisis. - But again, and now there's\nmore nations are prepared and ready to launch.\n- Yeah. - I don't know.\n- And you have a media and a 24 hours kind of, like, thing that makes you, like,\nat edge the whole time. - Oh, that's dark.\n- That's crazy. - There's a dark perspective on this where there's certain members of the media that would kind of enjoy the prospect of nuclear war, like, a little bit. Just let's get us close to it as possible. - You have another factor that will contribute to that. Religion. And you remember how,\nlike, the radical Islamists talk about, like, the\nend of time and whatever, but like, most of the Islamic\ndon't have that much power. Problem is with Christian\nZionists now being on the top of the world with America. They have been pushing\nfor that kind of conflict to kind of escalate, escalate. Listen to Sarah Palin, it's\nlike, God wants us here. Like, Karl Rove, all of the new cons. The dispensationalist, Reagan. There's an incredible book called, like, \"Forcing the Hands of God.\" Oh, beautiful book. I read this like, it's published 1998, but it still matters today. The whole idea about like, especially the Zionist Christians who love Israel, but they hate the Jews. They're anti-Semite, but they love Israel because of its role. This is all basically formed because of the interpretation\nof the Bible of Scofield and how they talk about the\nend of time, the Armageddon, and then late great planet Earth, and then left behind\nserious and all of that. It's all about like, we\nare heading to Armageddon. And the problem is, there are people that believe that the end of time. And then we have the Christians that believe in the end of time. And then you have Israel happy that those people are using\nit for the end of time. And then the whole idea about\nthem pushing as many weapons and troops and people in the Middle East to be there for the nuclear holocaust. And John Hagee, one of the\npastors talk about that, about the brimstones. And it's not gonna be a nuclear holocaust. All that people, it's crazy how people are so despising life that\nthey are wanting death. So now, you all would\nhave these revelations, but these revelations mean nothing if you don't have an effective weapon in order to make it happen. And this is the crazy thing. And I'm worried that the end\nit's going to be by someone that wants to meet God\na little bit earlier. - Somebody who's really in a hurry. Well, I have good news for you. Maybe we'll become a\nmultiplanetary species. - Maybe Elon Musk will lead us, lead the way.\n- To get out in space. - Maybe he's one of them,\nhe's a secret lizard. - I asked you offline to not\nmention the lizard people. (Bassem laughs) - There's like a whole people that believe in the\nlizard people, it's crazy. I actually have to be honest, I haven't fully looked into lizard people. I probably should.\n- You should. - Yeah, well, maybe I'm\nafraid of the truth. (Bassem laughs) (Bassem humming) (both laugh) - Removing my face now. - I mean, so let's say you're wrong about the end of the world. - I hope so.\n- And it all turns out great and humanity flourishes. Why would that happen? What gives you hope for that\ntrajectory for humanity? - Younger people, the people of TikTok that you don't like. (laughs) Yeah, there is a lot of,\nlike, bullshit there. - You know, after you saying this, people will just keep\nsending you TikTok videos, these younger people?\n- These younger people. (both laugh) - This woman showing\nher boobs? That woman? - That's gonna save us? (Bassem laughs) - All right, bosom. Thank you. - No, like, I think\nthere is a wealth of it. You know, remember like,\nthe joke that said like, we thought that, like,\nwhen we have internet, we gonna have like, be more,\nyou know, more informed. And now, we're watching twerking\nvideos, and that is true. But on the other side, the fact that you have availability of information. I'm learning a lot, and there's people who are using that platform for that. It's not the majority because, you know, it's not very interesting and exciting. But I think there might be a tipping point where there's enough\npeople that would be aware and maybe they would\ncollectively do something in order to bring back the\npower to the small man. And maybe it sounds very\nnaive, but we don't know. We don't know, because you've already seen the legacy media and the\nlegacy politicians shaking in the past few months. - [Lex] They're getting nervous. - They're getting nervous, because people are calling them out. And those people were, like,\nhiding behind their desk, behind in their offices and not like, not holding a vouch for that, but, like, people now\nare calling them out. And it is not gonna happen,\nlike, this year or next year. But I think it's something. - What advice would you\ngive to those young folks? - I will never give\nadvice to those people. (both laugh) - Get off TikTok. - I will never because, like, their input is different than mine. - Yeah.\n- But like, there's one thing I\nlearned when people saw me. Did the revolution fail in Egypt? Did people that the people are, it's like, listen, the revolution is not an event. It's not like, hey, we go\nin, we topple the government. It's not a revolution. A revolution is a process,\nit's a very long process. And maybe that process, I mean, as much as we don't like what\nhappened in the Arab world, but the people there, the\nawareness that happened and the discussions that have been opened, that you didn't even imagine would happen in the Middle East is happening. And maybe the beginning\nof any, any hope of change is that people start\ntalking, speaking out, talking about stuff they were\nnot allowed to speak about. Like, for example, Israel. (laughs) - The revolution continues. - Ah, yes. - Bassem, you're a beautiful human being. It's truly a pleasure\nand honor to meet you. I could just feel the\nlove radiating from you. I hope I get to see you perform live. I hope to get to see you many more times. Thank you for being who you are. - Thank you so much, and\nI would love to invite you for my new special, the\nIslamo-Nazi. (laughs) - That should be the title\nof your autobiography. - Islamo-Nazi, thank you so much. - Thank you, brother. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Bassem Youssef. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you\nsome words from Jon Stewart. \"The press can hold its magnifying\nglass up to our problems, bringing them into focus, illuminating issues heretofore unseen, or they can use that magnifying\nglass to light ants on fire and then perhaps host a\nweek of shows on the sudden, unexpected, dangerous,\nflaming ant epidemic.\" If we amplify everything, we hear nothing. Thank you for listening, and\nhope to see you next time."
