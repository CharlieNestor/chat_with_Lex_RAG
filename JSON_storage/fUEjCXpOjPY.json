      "text": "- We have been encouraged\nculturally to criticize people we're in long-term\nrelationships with, not new relationships. New relationships, you put\nthe person on a pedestal, you're allowed to just,\noh, they're wonderful. But every trope out there in\nevery form of popular media is like the wife rolling\nher eyes at the husband and the husband being like, oh, there's loathsome\nheartbeat that castrated me. As if like, people are just\npassive players in their lives. And I think that is an\nincredibly toxic message to send to people.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - That this is how we should\nbe relating to our partner. Like we should not, you don't take the piss outta your partner in front of people.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Like the successful\nrelationships I've seen are where people are just\ncheering for their partner where they're thick as thieves, where there is just this feeling of like, man, they like each other. They got each other's back\nlike you wouldn't believe. Man, you could take sides against anybody, but take sides against their partner. You're going down, and that when you see\na couple that has that, that's so hard to break. But I think that comes from\nhaving like a steadfast. Yeah, no, I don't do that.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I don't talk my partner.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And you don't shit\ntalk my partner to me. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And that to me is when, because I think we're just\nso criticized by the world. The world is so full of criticism. We criticize ourselves so harshly, that having a partner who\nno matter what is like, you've got this, I'm with you. Okay, yeah, you screwed up, I see it. Look, I'm not gonna lie to\nyou about your blind spots. You screwed up, but you know what? People screw up sometimes. You got a right to screw up. A lot of people screw up. Come on, get up. Let's go. I know you have it in you. If you have that person like that. I feel like that's a superpower. - The following is a\nconversation with James Sexton, divorce attorney and author\nof \"How to Stay in Love A Divorce Lawyer's Guide\nto Staying Together\" As a trial lawyer, James, for over two decades has negotiated and litigated a huge number\nof high conflict divorces. This has given him a deep understanding of how relationships fail\nand how they can succeed. And bigger than that, the role of love and pain in this whole messy\nrollercoaster ride we call life. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's James Sexton."

      "section": "Why marriages fail",
      "text": "What is the most common\nreason that marriages fail? - That's a great question, but it's a question that everybody wants there\nto be a simple answer. Like they want me to say cheating\nor money or the internet. But the reality is, I think it's a lot of little things. It's disconnection. That would be my answer. The reason marriages\nfail is disconnection. What causes disconnection? That's the bigger, and I think more important question because like Tom Wolf\nsaid about bankruptcy, \"It happens very slowly\nand then all at once.\" Disconnection happens very\nslowly and then all at once. So most of the time, what I think people want\nis an answer like cheating. But cheating is the big all at once thing. How did we get to the place where cheating was even something you\nwere thinking about doing, or that you would think about and then cross the line\nfrom thought into action? And that's I think the big question. So disconnection would be my answer. - Do you think it's possible to introspect like looking backwards\nfor every individual case where the disconnection\nbegan and how it evolved? - [James] Sure, yeah, this is\nsuch a multi-variate equation. It's a dance. It's a chemistry. It's what did you do and\nwhat did the other person do? And see, the interesting thing about\nbeing a divorce lawyer is I'm weaponizing intimacy in a courtroom. I'm telling it's full context storytelling what I do for a living. So what I do is I take my client's story and I have to present it to a judge and make my client the hero in\nevery way and the other side, the villain in every way. Now I have to be careful not to do that in a manner that loses credibility. Because even a judge would know, even a judge is smart enough to know that no one's all good or all bad, but only if you were reverse\nengineering a relationship and saying, how did this break? You really have to look at both people, the good and the bad. What each of them did that moved the dial in\nthese different directions. And I think that that's very hard for anyone\ngoing through a divorce to do about their own relationship. We don't know who discovered\nwater, but it wasn't a fish. Like if you're in it, I don't\nthink you see it clearly. I think as a divorce\nlawyer whose job is to really drill down on the facts and figure out what's\ngoing on in this story, I have to look at both sides. So I have to think a lot\nabout my own arguments, but I also have to think about what's the other lawyer's\nargument going to be, especially in custody cases. So I really have been\nforced to look at both sides for so many years, so\ndeeply in relationships. That once you do that, you realize that the\ngood guy, bad guy thing just doesn't apply. - I wonder if it's the little things or a few big things that\ncause this connection, whether it's, I mean, you've talked about granola and blowjobs, but those seem to be stories that you can tell to yourself like, maybe that story should be explained. Or maybe not. - You don't think granola and\nblowjobs is self-explanatory. - Almost. I think people can construct a good, like if you ask GPT what do they mean? I think the story that would\ncome up is a pretty good one. But that's a story you tell\nabout when you first knew it's the disconnection has begun, is when you stop buying\nmy favorite granola, or when she stopped giving blowjobs. - I would say when it's\nreached like a critical mass. - Yeah, face shift of some sort. - 'Cause I think it started before that. When she said, yeah, I\nused to give him blowjobs and when we were in\nour early relationship, and then one day like, I just was like, oh, well, we don't have as much time. Well, I'll wait until\nlater and we'll have sex and then we both enjoy it. - Blowjobs are inefficient. - Yeah, exactly correct. - So you batch it all together. - Yeah, so she said, well, exactly. And they had kids at that point, so I think she really was like, hey, we've got a certain window. - Yeah. - So let's have something we both enjoy. So I don't think she had any\nnegative intentions there. I think that she was working in good faith towards the betterment\nof the relationship, but it was having this\nsecond order effect. And so I really do think that, yeah, the blowjobs, the granola, I mean, there anyone who's been\nin a long-term relationship, I guess it's just worth\nasking the question, what does this person do\nthat makes me feel loved? Because I think it's very interesting in my own experience in life. Remember, I had a difficult\nchapter with one of my sons, my younger son when he\nwas in his early 20s, and we were having a\nheartfelt conversation. And I said to him, \"Do\nyou know I love you?\" And he said, \"Well, yeah, of course I do.\" I said, \"But do you feel my love? Like, do you feel it?\" You know, not just do you\nknow it intellectually? Do you feel it? And I remember thinking to myself, when do we feel someone's love, right? Like what is it that they do? And sometimes it's the weirdest, silliest things that\nthey would never know. They, the person who's\nshowing us that they love us and that we're feeling their love. They would never show us, if you said, \"Why does\nthis person love you?\" They wouldn't say, Oh, 'cause I always make sure\nthat when the paper comes, I bring it from the bottom\nof the driveway to the door so they don't have to go out and get it. Or I always hold the door for them. Or I, you know, oh, I always like, again, I buy the granola that I\nknow this person likes. Or I remembered that they don't like it when I put on this particular\nrecord, so I don't put it on. And those are these, yes,\nthey're small things, but they're not small. They're kind of everything. - Do you think it's good\nto communicate that stuff? - Well, a 100%. - It takes away some of\nthe power of it, right? - When you point it out,\nthen the person realizes, oh, okay, he likes this or dislikes this. So yes, there becomes a\ndeliberateness to it, a conscious. So I understand not pointing that out when it's a good thing. I think when it's a negative thing. Like I think in the granola situation, if she had said to him, \"Hey, you used to do\nthis and you've stopped. That feels like something to me.\" Like she said, she didn't\nsay anything about that, just like he probably didn't say anything about the blowjobs. I think if there had been a\nmoment of this is starting, let's talk about it while it's starting. But people wait from what I can see. - [Lex] Yeah. - People wait until the big thing happens. The financial impropriety,\nthe substance use disorder, the cheating. They wait for that to happen and then they go, where did we go wrong? And the answer is quite a while ago, with the granola. - Yeah. Yeah, so when you notice something like you notice that little something, talk about it, 'cause that little something is probably a colonel of a deeper truth. Of course, there is also moods, we're all like a rollercoaster of emotion. So you can not bring a\ngranola one day just to, just because you're in this place where just nothing is-\n- [James] Yeah, yeah. - Just cynicism everywhere,\njust anger and so on. But it's a temporary feeling. But maybe that temporary\nfeeling is grounded in some other deeper current\nthat's actually building up. - Yeah. And I think a good partner\nwants to understand the currents - [Lex] Yeah. - Of their partner, that\nthey wanna understand. \"Hey, are you going through something?\" And look, if I'm the one\nyou need to take it out on, that's okay. I'm a big boy, I can take it. If you're hormonal, if\nyou're frustrated at work, if you're whatever. We should be able to have a little bit of that\ninteraction in a relationship. But I do think it's so\neasy to just say to people, well, communication is the key. But it really is about fearless\nkinds of communication. It's about really, honestly\nsaying to somebody, this feels like something to me. Am I wrong? This just feels like something to me. And also how that's presented. I mean, one of the things\nI'm very caught up on, or feel very strongly about is that we have been encouraged\nculturally to criticize people we're in long-term relationships with. Not new relationships. New relationships, you put\nthe person on a pedestal, you're allowed to just,\noh, they're wonderful. But every trope out there in\nevery form of popular media is like the wife rolling\nher eyes at the husband and the husband being like, oh, there's loathsome heartbeat\nthat castrated me. As if like, people are just\npassive players in their lives. And I think that is an\nincredibly toxic message to send to people. That this is how we should\nbe relating to our partner. You don't take the outta your\npartner in front of people. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like the successful\nrelationships I've seen are where people are just\ncheering for their partner where they are thick as thieves, where there is just this feeling of like, man, they like each other. They got each other's back\nlike you wouldn't believe. Man, you could take sides against anybody, but take sides against their partner. You're going down. And that when you see\na couple that has that, that's so hard to break. But I think that comes from\nhaving like a steadfast. Yeah, no, I don't do that.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I don't shit talk my partner. - [Lex] Yeah. - And you don't talk my partner to me. - [Lex] Yeah. - And that to me is when, because I think we're just\nso criticized by the world. The world is so full of criticism. We criticize ourselves so\nharshly that having a partner who no matter what is like\nyou've got this, I'm with you. Okay, yeah, you screwed up. I see it. Look, I'm not gonna lie to\nyou about your blind spots. You screwed up, but you know what? People screw up sometimes. You got a right to screw up. A lot of people screw up. Come on, get up. Let's go. I know you have it in you. If you have that person like that. I feel like that's a superpower to have that effect on another person. - Yeah, one of the things I love seeing, you look at a couple and one is talking like in an interview. - [James] Yeah. - Answering a question, especially like intellectual questions. What do you think about the\nwar in Ukraine or something? And then the partner is talking and the other person is looking at them as if they're hearing the wisest thing- - [James] Yeah.\n- Ever. - [Lex] Yeah. - They're still looking at them, not waiting for their turn to speak, not thinking about how's the\naudience going to take that? - [James] Yeah. - But they're looking at\nthem like, God, I'm so lucky. - [James] Yeah. - To be with this smart motherfucker. - Is it not? But there's this scene- - And they could be seen\nthe dumbest shit out there. (laughs) - There's a scene in the\nmovie \"True Romance.\" - [Lex] Yes, I love \"True Romance.\" - I love a great movie.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I mean, Gary Oldman scene is like the greatest scene ever done\nin film with Christian Slater. But there's a scene in it\nwhere she holds up a sign to Christian Slater and\nit says, \"You're so cool.\" - [Lex] You're so cool. - And like, man, that's it.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - That's it.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I've always, I think I say\nit somewhere in the book that, you go to weddings and\nwhen the bride walks in, everybody's looking at the bride. It's her show. Everybody turns around\nas the first glimpse everybody gets at the bride. And I never look at the bride, I always look at the groom\nlooking at the bride, because there's this\nlike, to me, that's every, like he has this look like this 'cause this is the first time he's seeing her in the\ndress most of the time. And also he's seeing her like, \"Holy shit, she's coming down the aisle. We're getting married.\" But this is it. And everyone's looking at\nher and I always look at him, 'cause I always think to myself like, the look on his face is like, that's like this feeling of\nlike, holy, yeah, wow, okay. Everyone's looking at her and she's mine and she's coming up here\nand we're getting married. And I feel like yeah, like that kind of adoration, I think that's the look we're\ndescribing is adoration, like that the words\ncoming outta their mouth that they're like, yeah, that's mine. That one's mine, you know. That's such a great thing. It's such a great feeling. - I've seen the good stuff\nlike with \"True Romance.\" I mean, you could make fun of the guys totally cringe wearing Elvis. - [James] Yeah. - Essentially being a\nfake Elvis with shades and like what is he doing? It's watching these kung fu movies. But from her perspective\nand from any perspective you could take on him is this\nis the baddest motherfucker who's ever lived. - [James] Yeah. - Like, he's willing to\ndo those things for me, but not like, it's almost\nlike an epic heroic figure. - [James] Yeah. - And we're living in\nthis epic hero story. - What does that do to him though? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- See, that's the point. If there's a point to this, to this whole thing-\n- [Lex] Yeah. this whole couple thing.\n- [Lex] Yeah. (laughs) - Isn't that it? - [Lex] Yeah. - I don't understand this idea of, we had a successful marriage. We were married for 50 something years. We were miserable for 47 of\nthem, but we hung in there. This is an endurance event. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like the primary\nrelationship of your life, you've decided you're gonna turn into the like a 50 mile trail race. Why? Why would you do that? Congratulations, you took\nthe concept of monogamy and made it something that two people are absolutely not gonna enjoy. But you hung in there. Congratulations. And I understand. There's religious perspectives that say, well, it's a sacred covenant, but I have a real chicken or\nthe egg problem with that. - [Lex] Yeah. - Because I think it was like, well, how do we sell this\nincredibly stupid concept that isn't working to people? I know, we'll tell 'em,\nGod says, you have to, and we'll sign on for that. I don't buy it. I don't buy it anymore. I really, 'cause when you see a successful marriage where you see two, even\nwithout a marriage, you see a pair bond. You see a couple that\nreally love each other and cheer for each other in that way. And hang on each other's words that way and like are just in each\nother's corner that way. You see the fake shit instantly. - [Lex] Yeah. - You see the difference right away. It's like, if you, you know, the first time I've, this is the first time\nI've come to Austin. I've thought I'd eaten a\nlot of barbecue in my life. I've never had Texas barbecue. - [Lex] Yeah. - I landed, I went and had barbecue. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - I was like, okay, I've\nnever had barbecue before. Apparently this is a\nwhole different thing. - [Lex] Yeah. - I think it's the same thing. I think it's like once you see real love, real love and I mean romantic love, like real love like that, real bond, real, you go, oh yeah, this other thing's not gonna do it. - Do you think that's a\ndaily deliberate choice that a couple like that makes? Because it feels like a very\neasy to do deliberate step. Choose to see the brilliant\nin it, the beautiful in it, and almost immediately everything shifts and it becomes this momentum where all you see is the beautiful, and all you see is the brilliant. - That is a conscious choice. I think approaching life that\nway is a conscious choice. Approaching any relationship\nthat way is a conscious choice. I mean, looking at someone who hurts you or does something hurtful to you, and thinking about what's\ngoing on in their life, that they're doing that or\nwhat's happening with them. Yeah, that's a very conscious choice. And I think a a better one. - [Lex] Yeah. - A better one than seething in animosity and letting that eat you alive. But I don't know that it's, I don't think it should be so difficult, like with our children, with our pets, we don't have this problem. You never have someone look at their dog who they've had for eight years and go, I gotta get a new dog. I've had this one for eight years. I gotta get, like puppies are so cute. What am I doing with this old dog? It's the total opposite. They're like, oh my God, this is like my dog. This is my dog. The smell of the dog is\nlike this is my dog smell. The bad habits of the dog. You're like, that's my stupid dog- - [Lex] Yeah. - That does stupid things. And it's not like that\nhas to be a conscious, they wake up every day and go, I should be grateful for the dog. Like it's just visceral. It's in them.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And your children\nlike people's children, it's why people are like not aware of how annoying their children are, because they're not annoying to them. I get it. To you, the sound of your\nkids shrieking is like, oh, my kid's having a good time. And you don't get, and see, when I try to, when I hear that, I try to\nhear it with those ears. Like, oh, that, I'm a parent, I get it. My kids are adults now. But like I get it. So when I hear a kid\nshrieking, I just am like, ah, to that parent, that's the sound of that kid\nhaving a great time and good. It's so nice that that's in the world. So for me, it has to be conscious. For that parent, I don't\nthink it has to be conscious. So I think it would be great\nif it didn't have to be a conscious practice,\nbut I wonder if like, anything in meditation or mindfulness, it's a matter of exercising\nthat way of seeing. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then once you've come to that- - [Lex] It becomes easier.\n- It does itself, right? It really does. I think initially has to\nbe a conscious practice. And by the way, it's easier to\nmake it a conscious practice before it started to fade, right? I mean, that's what's so\namazing about marriage is there's like almost eight\nbillion people in the world, and you're picking this one. So when you marry in theory, like the stock's at its highest, you're as crazy about each\nother as you could possibly be. So that's the time to get\ninto this mindfulness, to get into this practice. Not once it's like the wheels\nare starting to come off. It's much harder. It's like gaining a bunch\nof weight and then saying, \"Okay, how am I gonna\nlose the weight now?\" - Well, I think that even before\nmarriage, like right away, you just see everything is beautiful. Let me quote BoJack Horseman on this. \"When you look at someone\nthrough rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags.\" - [James] That's great. - And there's a certain sense where if you from the very beginning, of course, you could end up in toxic\nrelationships that way. - [James] Sure. - But life is short. You're gonna die eventually, might as well really go\nall in on relationships. - There's a line in \"Drugstore Cowboy,\" which is a great film. Where he says, \"We played a game you\ncouldn't win to the utmost.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - And I think everything, I think life is a game you can't win. And so you play it to the utmost. To love anything is insane because you are accepting\nthat you're going to lose it. I'm a dog person. You get a dog and you've just resigned\nyourself to unbelievable pain because this thing's gonna\ndie in like 10 years, maybe 15 if you're lucky. And why would you open your heart to that? Why would you let, because the joy is just\nso wonderful of it, of the ride up until it. Same thing with us. I mean, every marriage,\nevery relationship, every love is gonna end. It's gonna end in death or divorce. So why not like, just go in, like go in, like go\nin, and just get weird. Don't define it the way that's, I mean, look at, you know, again, we keep going back to \"True\nRomance,\" but just get weird. Like, yeah, I love this Elvis\npretending to be weirdo. I love this former sex\nworker who's like whatever. Just go in. Love this person, have 'em love you. Don't worry about what\neverybody else is doing in their relationship. We're in such, I mean, it's not to me surprising that, that as the performative aspects of life on social media increases. People's satisfaction\nwith their relationships and the divorce rate is\nfollowing the same trend. Because I think everyone's going, well, what's everybody else doing? Well, how much sex is\neveryone else having? The only two people\nthat should worry about how much sex you're having? The two people. If the two people are\nhappy in the relationship. Great, then what does it matter? What does it matter what\neverybody else is doing? - Yeah, there should be an\nelement to great relationships and great friendships\nof like fuck the world. - [James] Yeah.\n- It's us versus the world. - Us, it's us.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And that's what I mean when\nI say that thickest thieves. When they're like a unit like that, 'cause it's, look, it's just us. It's just what we want. It's what we like. And that's why I said like, even when it comes to\nsex or things like that, if you can't be candid with your partner about whatever weird shit you're into or what fantasy you had in any particular. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well then who the hell\ncan you be candid with? I mean, because you're\ngonna either go without or go elsewhere, and neither of those is a\nparticularly healthy option or helpful option. It's the start of that decline. So why? Why open yourself to that decline, which invariably is just the path to the chair in front of me in my office? - Yeah,"

      "section": "Sex and fetishes",
      "text": "you have a full section in\nyour book on foot fetishes. - I do.\n(Lex laughs) I do, yeah. Which is funny because I\ndon't know anything about foot fetishes.\n- Me neither. Me neither.\n- Yeah. I'm not king shaming anybody, but there's nothing sexual\nabout feet to me at all. I just don't get it, I don't, but I mean, listen, people\nlike things, it's good. But yeah, I have had clients\nthat have odd fetishes or sexual proclivities\nor things they wanna do, and they don't share it\nwith their partner at all. And then they find an outlet for it because they try to go without\nit and that doesn't work. So they try to find some\nother outlet for it. And then that's interpreted as a betrayal and it creates distance\nand people split up. And of course, everybody\nlikes to have like, you know, a bad guy to blame it on. So when you say, well,\nwhy'd you guys get divorced? Oh, 'cause he secretly had a foot fetish and he was on these message boards- - [Lex] Right.\n- Meet people but. Well, it gives you an easy answer as to why the two of you split up. But I don't think, you know, most divorces have such simple answers as it was a foot thing. But I also think too, like, listen, if you got a partner, I mean, we all do stuff\nthat we're not super into because we're in a relationship. And that's what part of it is. Do you really wanna go\nsee that chick flick? Do you really wanna\neat at this restaurant? Do you really wanna go\nto her cousin's wedding? No, but you know, part of\nbeing in a relationship is, okay, if you're into this, I'm gonna pretend this song's a good song. Even though it's not my favorite song. And I think I just don't know, we've turned sex, I mean, sex has been so\npoliticized in recent years, maybe it always was. But I think we've made it into something where we can't just, I don't know. I'm not in defeat, but if the woman I love was like, I'm really in defeat, I really wanna do stuff with your feet, I'd be like, all right, I can\npretend that I'm into that. It's not gonna kill me.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I'm not gonna be able to make it a centerpiece of our coupling. But like, yeah, I can pretend\nI'm in the feet, if you want. - I don't personally have any fetishes that are outside of the normal discourse. - As a divorce lawyer, I get to experience the whole spectrum. - But if I, like if I was\ninto furries, for example, - [James] Yeah. - I don't know how I would\ninitiate the conversation with my partner about that. - But frame the question\nthe other direction. - [Lex] Yeah. - If you were into furries. - [Lex] Yeah. - How do you prevent your partner from knowing anything about that? That feels like a real, you'd have to make a conscious choice to not let your partner know. - [Lex] Sure, sure. - I don't think either of those\nis a particularly palatable or easy proposition. - But a lot of people live life hiding some part of themselves. - Yeah, quite unsuccessfully. The second order effects of\nthat are very rarely positive. - [Lex] Sure. - I don't think I've ever\nmet someone and went, yeah, I really hid this huge part of myself for an extended period of time. - And it worked out great. - And that's the best thing that happened. It's I'm really glad, I'm really glad I stayed in\nthe closet as long as I did. It really worked out. Like it rarely does. It's a question of how\nlong can you hold it off? - [Lex] Yeah. - I know gay men who stayed\nin the closet for 40 years, 50 years of their lives, and then they had a successful\nsecond chapter as a gay man. I've had clients like that. Do they regret that\nthey were in the closet? No, because they were married. They had kids, like they had experiences\nthey're glad they had. But would their advice to\na young person in their 20s and 30s who's gay, stay in the closet, 'cause then you can have\na wife and some kids, and then you can come\nout when you're 50 or 60 and have a second chapter, no. - [Lex] Yeah. - They would say, \"Be who you are. Don't be afraid.\" - As you were talking,\nI'm trying to think of, 'cause I'm publicly and privately\nI'm the exact same person or try to be the exact same person. So I usually try to make\nsure there's nothing to hide. But I was trying to come up\nwith a counter example fee for if there's good things to, well, I mean, there could\nbe like past relationships. - [James] Oh yeah. - If I slept with thousands of women or something like this, maybe you wanna put that to the\nside when you have the guts. - Well, you don't wanna be in, there's a difference between\nbeing honest about something and being indelicate about it. - [Lex] Right. - I think we all do this with lovers. Like any of us who've been in\nmore than one relationship, you would not at the end of sex be like, that was the third best sex\nI've ever had, you know. It's just indelicate, it's rude. So I don't think it's a matter\nof total candor at all times, but I think if you were\nusing the furry example, and I'm not picking on furries. I just think if that is a proclivity that is anything other\nthan a passing thought, like it's something that you\njust keep coming back to, then you're making a conscious decision to withhold it from your partner. And what is that out of? I mean, I would say it's\nprobably out of fear. I'm not a psychologist,\nbut probably out of fear. Fear that they would reject you. That they, okay, well now\nsee, I genuinely believe that, I'm very conflicted in my religious faith, but I don't know that\nI believe in the devil, but if there was a devil, I think his principle function\nwould be to convince us that we are so Beast Jill,\nthat God couldn't love us. It would be to convince\nus that we're awful and that we should just\nlean into the awfulness. And I know the greatest low points of my life came whenever I just went, you know what? I'm just awful, I might as well just behave awfully. And I really believe that when you push down parts of yourself like your sexuality, like your insecurities, your true feelings from\nyour romantic partner, the person who's supposed\nto be you're number one, you are making sure you\nwill never feel their love because they don't love you. They love the you you've\npresented to them, which you know in your\nheart is not the authentic, honest, real you. And so if you know\nyou're super into furries and you don't tell your\npartner about that, and your partner says, I love you so much, and you know what I love, one of the things I love about us is we have such great sexual chemistry. You'll never feel that\nlove because you know, yeah, that's not true though. She doesn't know. She doesn't know that actually\nI'm not really satisfied and there is this thing that I want, that I know I can't even tell\nher 'cause I'm so ashamed of, like that doesn't feel\nlike a good option to me. - Yeah. Yeah. So that kind of vulnerability\nis essential to intimacy. - I'm prone to jiu-jitsu metaphors, and this is one of the first conversations where I can actually use them because the person I'm talking\nto is a jiu-jitsu person. But- - And people should know that you are a quote unquote \"jiu-jitsu person.\" You have been afflicted with the disease. - I am a brown belt under Marcelo Garcia, and I am like a seven\nyear brown belt now so. - Which is the right\nway to be a brown belt. - Well, and also I am, you know, late middle aged, middleweight,\nand moderately talented. And training at that academy with so many incredibly talented people and training in New York City where there's so many\nunbelievably talented people. You're constantly humble and\nfeeling like you should just be wearing a blue belt all the time. But a lot of, I think as you know, and as most people who\npractice jiu-jitsu know, you start to sort of see\njiu-jitsu in everything. I genuinely believe that in love, you have to give something\nto get something. Everything you do creates a vulnerability. Every move you make in\njiu-jitsu creates opportunity and creates vulnerability. And so you have to be willing\nto create vulnerabilities in order to get any leverage, in order to get any progress and any way to move the position. You don't want a marriage\nthat's just two people both in 50-50, like you just sitting in\nthat guard doing nothing. You want it to actually move along. - Yeah, I mean, that's the way I see love in relationships is you should take that\nleap of vulnerability, give the other person the\noption to destroy you. - Well, you have to expose, and that's the part that I\nthink is hard for everyone is to expose yourself in that way. But that's what I mean, even when I said about getting\na dog or having a child, like loving anything is\ntremendously courageous because it's terrifying. And it's only brave if you're scared. If you're not scared, it's not brave, it's just stupidity. It's bravery when you're afraid\nand you do the thing anyway. And so love is like, yeah, it's scary. I don't care who you are."

      "text": "In the jiu-jitsu community like I'm around as you are all like\nincredibly tough people, physically tough people,\nmentally tough people. But I've seen some of\nthose people taken down. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- By 120 pound woman. (Lex laughs) Not from a grappling perspective, but they are taken apart.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - By a woman in their life. And vice versa, I've seen\nmen, you know, who like, it really is shocking how much leverage we give to our romantic partners and how little discussion we really, genuine discussion we\nreally have about it. How much we really are ever\ntrained to think about it. There's nothing in school\nthat teaches us about it. So much of literature and art\nis an idealized version of it. So little of it is real. - And no matter how it evolves, when it ends in tragedy or drama, I feel like what people don't do enough is appreciate the good times. Appreciate how beautiful it\nis to having taken the risk and to having experienced\nthat kind of love. I think when you look at people that are divorcing each other, there's a Edgar Allan Poe quote, \"The years of love have been forgot, in the hatred of a minute.\" I always kinda am saddened, like deeply saddened how\npeople seem to forget how many beautiful\nmoments have been shared when some reason, some drama, some breakup leads them to part ways. - Yeah, yeah. It's interesting that you came to that not being a divorce lawyer, because I've felt that\nway for a long time. And I really try to say to my clients, like in the courtroom at\nthe negotiating table, I have a role to play where I have to be sort of like a pit bull or some kind of a like\na courtroom sociopath, but behind closed doors,\nI'm very candid with people. I'm try to be much more\nemotionally attuned with them. - So you're an empath in the sheets and sociopath in the streets. - Exactly correct. That's well said. I've been, boy, I got a new tattoo idea. That's good. I like that. I do believe when I'm behind\nclosed doors with people, I say to them, \"How you\nend things is gonna be how you're gonna remember\nthe whole thing.\" And that's unfortunate because you watch like a two hour movie and if the last 15 minutes of it sucked, you go, well that movie sucked. Well, the first hour in 45 was great, but you walk out with this\nbad taste in your mouth. I'm genuinely in awe of\nhow easily people forget that they loved each other. And I'm amazed because\nby the time I meet them and by the time they\nhire me to be a weapon against the person they were in love with, there's nothing but animosity there. And so I have to try to imagine what these two people looked like when they were in love with each other, and how that even existed. But I have to tell you, I don't function that way. Every woman I ever had\na relationship with, when I think of them, I don't think of the ending necessarily. I think of, I try to think\nabout the greatest hits. I try to think about the\nmoments that were wonderful, where I loved them and they loved me. And like there was joy\nand there was connection. And I don't know why you choose not to. There's that old axiom,\nI don't know who said it, that if you don't learn\nto find joy in the snow, you'll have less joy in your life and precisely the same amount of snow. - Yeah. - And I genuinely believe like, okay, the relationship ends. This is where it ends, we're done now. I am making a choice as to\nhow I will remember you. And we do it in relationships. I always tell people, if you ever wanna see a couple light up, if they're ever like the\ncouple at the table that's, you know, it seems like they\ngot in a fight or something, ask 'em how they met. And most people when they\ntalk about how they met, like their face softens, they both, and the other person looking\nat them telling the story gets that look you were\ntalking about before. And 'cause they remember that thing and how they felt at that moment. And when this person was a choice, not a default, not their\nautomatic plus one, but the person they asked to the wedding, not the, of course, you're\nbringing her, it's your wife, you bring your wife places. Like it was still, hey, there's like, 3 and a 1/2 billion women and\nI'm picking you, you know. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like that feeling. And I don't know why\nwhen a relationship ends, you can't do that. A lesson I learned when\nmy mother passed away, she had a two year\nterrible battle with cancer and was on hospice and\nwas very, very sick. And it was a very slow and awful end. And I remember one of\nmy worst fears was that this is how I would remember my mother for the rest of my life. That I would never be\nable to think of her. That I didn't think of what she had become in the last months where she was withered away\nto nothing in this bed. And I learned over time that\nmemory is very kind that like, that faded somehow. And that now when I remember her, I remember her healthy and vibrant. I remember her laughter. I remember positive things. Some of that is, I like to\nlook at photos of that or, but some of it is just\nhow I think memory works. And I don't know why we don't\napply that to relationships. And I think part of it is\nbecause we have this binary view of relationships that it's either success, which means you live happily ever after for the rest of your\nlives and die together. Or in short succession. Or it was wrong, it was awful. And I don't understand why that would have to be how we do it. I think we could look at\nrelationships like what they are, which is chapters in a book. And that book is our life. And those chapters all have significance. And none of them would,\nthe later chapters, none of them would happen\nwithout the prior ones. So there's this beauty to me of that. And I don't know if that it's a choice or if that is how it is and\nthe rest is just narrative that we've put on top of it\nculturally for some reason. - Well, I think to push back a little bit, I think memory can also, I\nthink it is a deliberate choice, 'cause I think memory can, basically, that's how trauma works. It can surface the negative stuff and the negative stuff\ncompletely drowns out all the positives. I think it's a deliberate choice to make your memory\nprobably work that way. In relationships, betrayal\ncan do that, right? Sort of cheating, infidelity, like one event can almost erase the entirety of your\nunderstanding of the past. And all the memories are sort of shrouded in this darkness of, okay, what I believed was\ntrue, is totally untrue. And sort of to overcome that and still appreciate\nthe beautiful moments. - I'm continually astounded\nby how long the hurt and anger of betrayal can reverberate. I have clients who were four years, five years past when the divorce ended, the cheating was discovered and they're as angry as they\nwere the day they found out. And I don't know what that's about. - [Lex] Yeah. - Because I also have clients\nthat they like look back on it and they go, we screwed up. We didn't do the best, but we did the best we\ncould do at the time. There should be stars for wars like ours. (Lex laughs) There should be champagne\nfor the survivors. - [Lex] Yeah, that's beautiful. - We made it through. We survived it and we were fools. And we were fools for love. And there are worse things\nin the world to be fools for. But I also do think\nthat most relationships where there was infidelity and it's not a popular thing to say, and I'll get pilloried for it, but- - [Lex] Great. - I just don't know, and I don't wanna blame\nthe victim of infidelity, but was the relationship\nreally where it needed to be? Were you truly the most\njust dutiful spouse who was seeing this person's needs be met? Again, we've established\nin the granola story that people can sometimes\nwith good intentions not be meeting their partner's needs or perceiving their partner's needs. Or their partner isn't\ncommunicating them the right way or all of the above. But I've rarely seen very\nhappy content couples that cheat on each other. And so I understand\nthere's a shame in saying, this person cheated on me, or I cheated on this person, 'cause I represent the cheater\nand I represent the cheated, I represent the victim\nof domestic violence and I represent the perpetrator\nof domestic violence. I represent the person with\na substance use disorder, the person married to the person. So I don't get to choose\nthe white or the black hat. Like I have my client\nand that's my client. And it's forces me to put\nmyself into their story, from their point of view. And I think that kind of radical empathy that you need to engage\nin on a daily basis to represent people in\nthose kinds of proceedings, it just I don't know, it just doesn't seem like\nthere's good guys and bad guys. It just seems like it's\ncomplicated and people's intentions and where they actually\nend up are different. - Yeah, I think there's some sense in still remembering the betrayal as it being symptom of taking\nlife a little too seriously. Too seriously where you don't, life shouldn't be taken that seriously. You should be able to laugh at it all. I like the story you say of being able to appreciate the battle that should give stars for those\nkind of wars that we fought and just kind of be\nable to laugh at it all. - Especially with love.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Like, that's just so absurd. - [Lex] Yeah. Like, it's so-\n- It's just crazy. - It's so crazy. I mean, like, I don't, you know what? I think it's funny I\nthink this is real candor, but as a man, there's nothing funnier than\nwhen you finish masturbating. There's no more humbling moment. And I like to think about the\nfact that like the richest, famous, most powerful person\nin the world, they jerkoff. The most powerful man in the\nworld jerksoff, I'm sure. All of them do. I mean, you probably probably\nknow them so you could ask, and that moment where you\njust, you come and you go, what am I doing? Like what the, now I gotta\nwipe the like, oh, good Lord. And there's this feeling of, but a second ago this\nseemed like a great idea and it was by the way,\nit was a great idea. There's this moment, this satori, where you just go, oh, like what? This is so silly. Well, that's love, that's sex. When you read other people's infidelity, the text messages, the emails, 'cause I have to do that all the time. And I'll tell you how we make the sausage. In a divorce lawyer's office, some of the most entertaining moments is dramatic readings aloud\nof people's infidelity exchanges with their lovers. - [Lex] The sexts. - Yeah, the sext and like, you know, it's just so ridiculous, 'cause people have to go through like all kinds of gymnastics to be able to meet and have sex in weird places.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And you're reading this and\nyou're reading these texts and you kind of go like,\noh my God, these people. And by the way, I've represented\nsome very powerful people and you read their texts with their lover or even their spouse,\nlike even their spouse, and they're just pathetic. I mean, they're just like so not powerful. They're so like, \"Hey babe.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - I have a name totally nameless- - [Lex] Yeah. - I have a very powerful,\nwealthy, famous former client where there's a whole\nseries of texts about, is my dick weird? Which by the way, I think the answer is, is if you have to ask if\nyou have a weird dick, the answer's probably yes, 'cause I've owned one and I've\nnever thought is this weird? The fact that you're\nhaving this discussion. It's absurd. It's hilarious. Love is hilarious. It's bizarre. It's such a weird vulnerability. It's such a basic visceral human need. It really is something that we just, it's mysterious. It doesn't have to be that complicated. I don't think that even\nbetrayal, like I said, it doesn't have to be that complicated. I think we can frame it differently. - Yeah, you can laugh at the whole thing. I mean, I think what we\ndon't often do with ourselves is look back at text\nor look back at emails or look back at Google\nsearch, I did that recently. Just looking at what I searched\nfor like 10 years ago, 15, it's like, forget last week. Just look at your Google\nsearches last week. And you're like, wait a minute, what? - [James] Right? - Why did you just search for this? - [James] Right, right. - 50 Times.\n- Right. Why did the karate kid\nthree pop into head? - [Lex] Yeah, exactly. - Why? - [Lex] And like your like- - Where's Ralph Macchio now? Where did the-\n- Who is he dating? - [James ] Yeah, yeah. - Vice and then mother\nand then you were like. - Oh, and then a restaurant nearby. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like how did I go from this to that? But it made sense at the time. - [Lex] Yeah. - So when you ask someone how did our relationship fall apart? It's like looking at the\nGoogle search history- - [Lex] Yeah. - Of yourself from tenure. You don't even know why you were thinking about those things.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And now you wanna understand\nwhy you did what you did. Felt what you felt,\nshe felt what she felt, she did what she did. And why the two of you,\nhow you impacted each other and interacted with each other. Really? You think that's doable? - In the courtroom, does that come up like text messages? - [James] Oh, yeah. - That resulted in with\nwhoever you're cheating with. You have to- - Yeah, I mean cheating\ndoesn't come up as much 'cause most states are\nno fault states now. So why someone's getting divorced, whether it's infidelity\nor it doesn't matter. There's no good spouse\nbonus or bad spouse penalty. - Well, there isn't. I mean, can you elaborate on that? Like that's-\n- Well you can have, we've had times where we\nhave to prove infidelity because we wanna prove what's called wasteful dissipation of marital assets. Which means that you were spending money that was marital money on a paramour. That's what the legal name for a ex, for a boyfriend or\ngirlfriend in the marriage. And usually the person calls\nit, you know that whore. - [Lex] Yeah. - Or that piece of shit.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - But we call them paramour. Yeah, the paramour.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Sometimes we have to prove\ninclination and opportunity. We have to prove that this\nperson had the inclination to cheat and that they had\nthe opportunity to cheat. And then we wanna show that,\nokay, so when they went away, that should be considered\ndissipation of marital assets. So if you go out to\ndinner with your brother, you didn't dissipate the marital estate, but if you bought your\nparamour a Tiffany bracelet, that would be a dissipation\nof marital assets and the person's entitled\nto a credit back for that from what was taken\noutta the marital estate. So we do sometimes have to\nauthenticate text messages on the witness stand or in depositions. And what's interesting about that is the way people approach it. Like people sometimes try to pretend, oh no, this is just my good friend, and which is just like,\nyou kill your credibility. Oh no, she's just my very good friend. She's not, she's not, that\nmakes no sense whatsoever, or no, we were just friends at that point. And then several months later is when we, once this marriage was over, that's when we got together as partner. - [Lex] Right.\n- That's ridiculous. But sometimes people just own it. Just own it. I did a deposition of an executive once and opposing counsel like thought they were gonna really hit 'em. They were like, and looking\nat this credit card receipt, what was this charge for for this hotel? He was like, oh, that was for a hotel room that I got with my girlfriend. And you were married? - Yes, yes. Where did you stay at the hotel? We didn't even stay. We actually just did\nlike an afternoon delight rolled around in bed for the day. - [Lex] (chuckles) Yeah. - And it was like, well now, you know, took all the thunder out of that. - What's the downside of doing that? It seems like a really- - There wasn't, it actually I\nthink helped his credibility. It was my client. So I thought it was the right move. We hadn't really discussed it in advance, but he was naturally\nintelligent enough to go, yeah. My credibility, I'm not\ngonna lie under oath, I'll admit what it was, but I'll do it in such an,\nwe did it like at the end, like Eminem at the end of \"Eight Mile.\" It was very like, yeah, I\ncheated on her with this person. Now tell these people something\nthey don't know about me. And that's kind of how I try to, as a trial lawyer, we actually in my firm refer to it as the \"Eight Mile\" strategy, which is like, we will, if I know there was a text message sent, you piece of, I hope you die. My client sent that text\nmessage to his co-parent. On my examination of\nmy client, I will say, I'd like to have this\nmarked for identification shown to the witness. What is that? It's a text message. Who's it to? Plaintiff. You sent it? Yeah. Read it out loud for the court. Do I have to? I think you should. You're a piece of S, does it say S? No.\n(Lex laughs) What does it say?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Well, it's a profanity. So you say it say, you piece of shit, I hope that she die. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You sent that to her? Yes. Why? I was really mad. Do you think that was good? No, do you think it was helpful for your co-parenting\nrelationship with her? No, why did you send it then? She sent me like 50\ntexts exactly like that. And I never responded. And I pushed it down every time, and then finally, I just blew up at her. If you had it to do over, again, would you do it differently? You know, I wish I could say I would, but the truth is I'm human\nand I was at my limits and I'm watching opposing counsel cross out entire sheets\nof their cross-examination 'cause it's gone now. They thought that they had\ntheir like Perry Mason moment, they had their like, did you\norder the code red moment? And it's gone now because if you just own and accept your fault or your\nissues in the relationship, you can take a lot of\nthe power outta that. - And I wish we wouldn't\ntake texts seriously. - I think we should have\nsubstantive discussions via text. I think text was designed\nfor, are you here? Yes. 15 minutes away, or I got\nhere safely, love you. Like that substantive discussions are people love having arguments via text. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And I have to say, when you read other\npeople's text messages, as I am often forced to do.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - It is amazing because just like that Google history you were talking about, I don't know how the hell you\ngot from one thing to another. Like I was just reading,\nactually on the way here, in the car, I was reading\nthrough a text exchange between two co-parents in\nthe middle of a custody thing that I'm involved in. And it's like, you piece of shit, you never cared about\nanything and I'm gonna take, you have no right to take\nthe kids from me, da, da, da. And then the next day, nothing in between. The next day, Maddie got a good\ngrade on her science thing. Oh, that's great, she's doing so well. It makes me so happy. Yeah, her teacher said\nshe's doing really well. Yeah, that's really great to see. I'll be there about 15 minutes late. No problem, see you then. Wait, like it was a day ago. I wanna know was there\na phone conversation in between where one of you went, \"Hey man, listen, I'm\nreally sorry about that. Oh no, look, we were both, whatever. Or is it just like you did that,\" and then we're supposed to\npretend that didn't happen and now we're just gonna talk about what Maddie got on her test. - Yeah, well, sometimes a good\nnap or a good night's sleep can solve a lot of emotional issues stuff. - I totally get it. But is there some, if you're looking just at the\ntexts, it begs the question, wouldn't she take the nap and then go, \"Hey, listen, I just woke up from the nap. It turns out I was really tired.\" Is that not happen by text? - No that's 'cause sometimes it's\nhard to probably apologize for being asshole, right? So I think we use just text. We humans use all kinds\nof forms of communication to kinda vent. I think it's the wrong thing to do, but people do do that. - Text has a permanence though. It's writing. I mean, it's writing. - You think like a lawyer.\n- [Lex] I like it. - Do think like a lawyer. But lawyers think like detail. And why would you write that down? Writing it down, would you write it down and would you put it on a\nbillboard in Times Square? 'Cause like that's, everything you say on\nFacebook or Instagram, can and will be used against\nyou in a court of law. Like every photo you post. I mean, that's going on\nwith a what's his name? Jake Paul or whatever Paul\nand Dillon Danis right now, that guy's girlfriend, every picture's ever\nbeen put on the internet of her by her is being\nweaponized right now. - To reference an earlier\npart of our discussion. That's love. You take a big risks. Big risk putting it out there. - [James] Yeah. - Putting it out there on text, putting it out there on social media. You take risks. - But is the reward of doing\nit via text worthwhile? Listen, the reward of love, I think is worth the risks of love. But the benefit of communicating by text, does it merit that risk\nof that being in writing, that the person can reflect on and review and scroll back and get\nheated up again about. - I don't know, we just take risks, and we're vulnerable with each other. - There may be something about text that for whatever reasons\ninspires a kind of candor because I think it is a new\nway to communicate, right? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- In the scheme of things. And so sometimes, we don't know the thing until it's really come into existence. So I don't know. I think it started as something\nthat we just communicated in a very extemporaneous, unplanned way. Like texts were meant to be, I'm here, I'm outside,\nwhatever it might be. And so what happens when you start to talk about more emotional,\ndeeper, bigger things, or visceral things or more\nemphatic passionate things using a technology that was originally just being used for the other purpose? I don't know the answer to that. What I do know is, yeah, as a lawyer, A, from an evidentiary perspective, and B, I just know what it\nlooks like on the outside. I know when I read it, what it looks like. And that's not always accurate. Like to just see the, it's like when you\nwatch a video of someone at just their worst moment, and the person that tries to say, but wait, that's not me. Like, that was just me in that moment. That was me at this incredible low point. And I think as a lawyer, my job is to weaponize that\nand to try to say, okay, this low point is indicative\nof who they actually are. - [Lex] Yeah. - And when I'm defending someone, I'm supposed to say, well,\nthis is their low point and we've all been to a low point and this is just a moment in this person and to judge them by that moment, would you wanna be judged\nby your worst moment? So I have to be able to look\nat that both directions. - Yeah, I mean, I don't think\nanyone looks great on text. - I mean, there's so\nmuch of our communication that is missing. Your expression. Like my sense of humor\ndoes not do well via text. 'Cause I have like sometimes\na sarcastic sense of humor- - [Lex] Yeah. - Or I have a dry sense of humor and it does not always\ntranslate well to text. The nuance of things is lost sometimes. - Yeah, but that's what makes\nthe risk of it hilarious. I mean, the emojis, the memes, all that, taking a risk. There's a risk with a text if you do some like dark dry statement, right? That's a joke. And then the pause, and then there's no\nresponse for a couple hours. I mean, that's beautiful, I don't know. That's- - It's the gap between the two trapezes, (Lex and James laughs) like once you've hit send and you're like, well, let's see where this goes? Like there's it coming back now, you know, and you're waiting and waiting. It's like that moment of just hang is, yeah, that's a rush. I mean, that's a rush. That's a beautiful thing. - Well, I have my friend\nMichael Malice living close by. And if the courtroom were ever\nto see the text between us, we would be both in jail. - [James] Okay.\n- For many- - [James] Who would have subpoena. - Many years, subpoena. Yeah, when this finally comes out, when I have my-\n- [James] Yeah. - We're gonna have Johnny\nDepp, Amber Heard moment. - [James] The subpoena's ready. - We'll get my (laughs) - Well, but that was one of,"

They both looked like what\nthey are, which is humans. - [Lex] Yeah. - Really flawed humans who had, it really is like that that\nPeople magazine thing stars. They're just like us, you know. We watched that and went like, oh yeah, they're just like us. Like they cannot keep it together. They cannot have, like they\njust have these ridiculous toxic moments where both of\nthem looked awful in that trial. - Well, what do you take\naway from that trial? Just given all the work you've done. I mean, for me, I don't know\nif you can speak to that. It's probably the first\ntime I've seen that kind of a complicated relationship. Even just to say a relationship\nlaid out in this raw form. Yeah, like the fights of a relationship. - Yeah. My feeling about that trial\nis there is no amount of money that would be worth laying that\nkind of stuff bare publicly. - For you if you were dying down. - For me, yeah. There's no amount of money. - But for Amber Heard, I don't know which. - Because they both look awful. They both look awful. And I don't think I'm qualified to say if one of or both of them are awful. But they both had\nmoments in that courtroom where their behavior\nand words looked awful. And I just don't know that, that exposing that to the\nworld, I just don't know. I mean, I understand the point of view that by bringing that suit,\nJohnny Depp was saying, look, yeah, I have to show these awful\nthings to the world about myself, but it's not as bad as what\nshe's claimed I've done, so I get it, I'm not\nsaying that's incorrect. And for Amber Heard, I\nthink her response is, well, for him to say I'm lying. I have to prove my, but my God, like what\nan awful thing to watch. All it really is is just another, it's just another couple. You know how banal that is? You know, how many of the- - [Lex] So this kind\nof stuff happens a lot. - A lot? It's the norm. It's not the exception. They just happen to\nhave like a grand scale 'cause they have lots\nof people around them- - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And lots of money. But yeah, it's all this, that kind of dysfunction,\nthat kind of chaos, that kind of, he said, she said, two people with completely\ndiffering histories of what happened in the marriage. False allegations of domestic violence or true allegations of domestic violence that are completely denied by the person. And you have witnesses\nthat'll say, oh my God, they never engaged in any kind. 'Cause again, no one\nengages in domestic violence with company over, you\ndon't like invite friends. People always say like, oh no, I saw them. They seem so happy. People always do this to\nme as a divorce lawyer. They come in and they go, well, here's photos of\nthe kids smiling with me. So that's proof that like, I'm a good dad. And I'm like, there's photos\nof Jeffrey Dahmer smiling with people he ate later.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And you think these photos\nproof something like I don't- - [Lex] Yeah.\n- The lack of, I'm in the middle of a very\ncomplex domestic violence trial. And the entire defense\non the other side is, well, we have photos of them on vacation where they look very happy\nand she never called the cops. That's no defense at all. Most victims of intimate partner\nabuse don't call the cops. They don't identify, self-identify as victims of domestic violence. - And they probably have many stretches of time of intense happiness or happiness. - Of course, of course. And by the way, perpetrators\nof domestic violence are charismatic. How else would they get victims? It's not like if they were ogre-ish, no one would sign on\nfor that relationship. - [Lex] Yeah. - It's that when they're\ngood, they're so good, that when they're bad, you go, but wait, no, that's not him the really\ngood person is him or her. We saw that in the\npublic testimony of that, you know, Depp, Heard thing is, there were moments where you\nlook at her and go, oh my God. Like I want one, just like that. And there were moments where\nyou listen to the testimony and go, oh my God, she's awful. Like what? That's just evil.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And the same for him. So I really, this should\nteach us something about how not only are there\ntwo sides to every story, that there's just so much\ncomplexity and nuance to these. But I think it, everyone\nwas asking the question whether you were team\nDepp, team Heard or team, I could care less about\neither of these people. Everybody's looking at it going, why? Eight billion people in the world? Why did you stay together? Just break up. You're miserable. It's obvious. It's obvious you're not this, this can't be worth it. - I've actually become\nfriendly with Camille Vasquez, who's the lawyer on the Depp side. She's an incredible woman-\n- Great lawyer. - And just a great human being, just how passionate she's about her work. I mean, you radiate this\nkind of same passion. Like she's just truly\nhappy doing what she does. - [James] Yeah, yeah. - And but also where the\nstress of a case is like takes, like it is becomes her. You can't sleep all this kind of stuff, which is fascinating.\n- Yeah, I think that's a function\nof our professions. Even after 20 plus years of doing this, like the night before a\ntrial, I can hardly sleep. And I-\n- [Lex] The excitement, fear? - Yes, yes.\n- [Lex] Okay. - All of that. All of that. And and I even have moments\nas I pull up to the courthouse and I listen, I wear certain cuff links that are like my lucky\ncuff links or something, and I pull up to the courthouse. I walk into the courtroom and I have this feeling\nin the pit of my stomach. And then it starts, and the moment it starts,\nsomething in me goes, oh yeah, I know how to do this. - [Lex] Yeah. - And it's instantly, like\nI just, I own it, I love it. And it's, yeah, the\npeople that love this job, being a trial lawyer, being a particularly a\ndivorce trial lawyer, family law, trial lawyer, I love it. I love it. I love it more than I loved\nit when I started doing it. I still, you know, I can't imagine spending five days a week looking forward to two. I love what I do. I don't know that I'll ever love anyone or anything more than I love the work. - So I saw you on talk with\nSteve Harvey a bunch of times, and I always loved it. One thing just sticks in my\nhead from something he said as a device that if you and\nyour partner, your spouse, if there's a fight, there's a difficult thing\nyou have to deal with. Keep that to yourself. Don't talk to anyone else. Like that's a little,\nlike a what does he say? Like a two arm circle or something, whatever the expression is. - [James] Yeah. - But basically resolve it all internally. Don't like when you face the world, you have a front of like rock solid. - Don't take sides against the family. - Yeah. (laughs)\n- [James] Yeah, it is. - Like it all boils down to \"Godfather.\" - Yeah, everything boils down\nto \"Godfather\" references. It really does.\n- And \"True Romance.\" - Yeah, you don't take\nsides against the family. You don't show that weakness to the world. I mean, again, I don't know that, I don't know that Steve\nin candor would say you shouldn't discuss it with\nyour own therapist, you know? - [Lex] Sure. - But I think what he's saying is don't project it out to the world. Don't share that, because\nI think, you know, it can change the way people\nview your relationship, which then will change the way\nyou view your relationship, - [Lex] Yeah. - And so I think don't run reckless when it comes to that primary relationship. Don't run your mouth recklessly. - Yeah. It's one of the things I\nmentioned to you offline that, my now close friend Joe Rogan, I've never heard him ever\nspeak negatively of his wife. It's always like super positive, how awesome of a person she is. And that to me has always\nbeen an inspiration to do the same for everybody in my life, to always speak positively about them. That has a probably a\nvirtuous spiral effect. - I'm sure. That's probably because\nhe has a great wife and he has a great wife\nin part because of that. - [Lex] Yeah. - I think it's clear\nthat he's in her corner and cheering for her. It's clear she's cheering for him. It's not like Joe Rogan's not\na man who has opportunity. I mean, he's surrounded by UFC\nring girls for god's sakes. This is a guy who has all\nthe opportunity in the world, and he seems to be\nquite a fan of his wife. And that is that's a superpower. Like that's a real thing. Now the question is, is, you know, he doesn't\nseem to talk about it. Like, oh, I gotta really work at that. - [Lex] Yeah. - And that's not a man who's afraid to talk about what he works at. He's pretty honest about, man, yeah, I gotta work really hard to stay in show. I gotta work really hard\nto be able to do this. Like Yeah, I'm not good\nat memorizing that. It takes time.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - But I've never heard him say like, oh, marriage is a lot of work. And I think that's to his credit, because it seems like\nthey're enjoying that. - [Lex] Yeah. - And it's also not incredibly public. It's not something, most people couldn't\npick her out of a lineup. - He kept it private for many years. And just because it's a private joy, it's a private deep, meaningful,\nintimate partnership. That's interesting. That's also an inspiration. Not everything about\nyour life has to be this. Look at me, I'm happy. I'm in a happy relationship. Everything is wonderful. - Especially that, I think there is something about the womb like cocoon like joy, you know, of like love. When you're just tucked in, snuggled in, like just pressed against\neach other with that. Like that, that's such a, you know, it's just the two of you.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And that's lovely.\n- [Lex] Yeah, that's peace. And that's such a good thing. We were just dying for connection. And that connection is so big. It's so everything. One of my earliest\npsychedelic experiences, probably when I was a teenager, but a theme that's been persistent in every psychedelic\nexperience I've ever had, is this idea of like,\neverything is connection. Everything is being pressed\nto someone and with them, like the warmth of human connection. One of the reasons I enjoy\nlistening to your work and your perspective has always been that I think at the core you\nsee connection and love. And I think for me, from my earliest experiences\nwith psychedelics at 16, 17, I was very attuned to that. I was very much, that was put\non my radar by psychedelics and just stayed part of\nmy consciousness forever. And I think I had a 30\nsomething year break from psychedelics, but it was like, when I came back to it, I went, oh yeah, it's still there. That's still the core of everything, is connection. - I mean, it's fascinating how\ndeeply you value connection, how empathic you are that you would be doing what you're doing which is, or is it not? - [James] I think it the opposite. - Counterintuitive. - No, I think it's actually why I'm well-suited for what I do. I think what I do is I have to\nlearn the story of my client and know it and feel it very deeply. And I have to feel it in a very human way that's very compassionate to this person. And then I have to feel it\nand understand it in a way that's incredible antagonistic to it, so I can shore up defenses. So I have to feel this\nperson's story and feelings from every possible angle, because every one of\nthem is a vulnerability and every one of them\nis a potential strength and a potential defense. And so I actually think\nit's my number one, other than extemporaneous\nspeaking ability, it is my number one\njob tool is the ability to radically empathize and to put myself in the\nemotional state of someone, in its best possible light\nand its worst possible light, so that I can see again the defense and I can see the vulnerability. - But I mean, so that's beautifully put. But also just to bear witness\nto this connection broken in the-\n- [James] Yeah. - In those dramatic way over\nand over and over and over. - That part is hard. But I was a hospice volunteer\nfor many, many years when I first got out of college. And it really showed me a lot about what is sadness, what is tragic, and what is just inevitable decay? What is pain and decay? We all die. We play a game you\ncan't win to the utmost. And so if we know the\nanswer to all of this is you're going to die, then what do we do with\nthe rest of that time? If all your stuff is just stuff, it's just gonna go to the, you know, the money's gonna go, everything is, your looks is gonna go, your everything's gonna go, love's gonna end one way another, then what are we doing? And again, I think it's\nlove and connection, but what I'm doing for\na living is helping. And I don't look at it\nas what I'm doing is helping people beat the\ncrap out of each other. I look at it as I'm\ntrying to help a client build their post-divorce life to sort of rise from the ashes of that which has fallen apart and move on to the next\nchapter and refocus and have the things they need\nfinancially, emotionally, whatever it might be interpersonally in terms of with their kids. And so for me, it's actually a job that is very consistent with my\ndesire to build connection and to be empathetic. - And witnessing the asterisks\ndoesn't make you cynical about the whole thing of love. - No, because again, 56% of\nmarriages end in divorce, but 84% are remarried within five years. We keep doing it over and over again. - [Lex] And that's a good thing. That's a-\n- I think it is a good thing. - The mess of it, the absurdity of it, the hypocrisy of it. That's something beautiful about that. - Well, it's just the return\nis so great on the investment. Listen, man, I've had more than one dog. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like when my dog died,\nthe first dog I had died, I remember when I'm\nnever gonna love again. I'm done, I'm done with this. I will never expose myself\nto this kind of pain again. I'll never have to take the dog bed and put it in the closet and like, ugh. And then some friend called me and said, \"We have an adoption event. Can you just watch this dog for 24 hours and then we'll take him.\" We just need you know, and I went, \"Yeah, right. I'll watch\na dog for the night,\" you know, da, da, da,\nand this dog come in. He said, oh, he has mane. He's not going. Fuck, I got another dog. He walked in and my heart went, yeah, I got a dog. And now that dog is 13 years\nold and his eyes are cloudy and he doesn't go up the stairs real well. And he is gonna break my heart. And I wouldn't change that for the world. - I'm still there. I'm still struggling for the second one. I lost a dog and it broke my heart. And yeah, but- - And you'll never lose that pain. But I promise you, your heart has an infinite capacity for the kind of love\nyou felt with that dog. And you'll never feel a\nlove that replaces the hole. There will never be another Buster for me. But there was Kaba\n(Lex laughs) and like-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - You know what? And when he's gone, there will\nnever be another one of him. But you know what? Like when that stupid puppy that was five months old stumbled in, I went, I guess I'm gonna do this again. And you know what? I'm so glad, I'm so glad, and I know by the way, I know now because, and that's where I've said like, you know, it's that Joseph Brodsky poem, a song like, \"I wish I knew No\nAstronomy when stars appear.\" I wish I didn't know the pain. But you know what? I don't care. I don't care. And I believe we don't care. Again, I think there's something to that. It's something hurts so badly and you go, I'm gonna do it again. I'm gonna do it, then it must be of value. It must be of real value. - There's also a different\nperspective on it, that pain. So there's that from \"Louie\"\nthe show of this interaction with an old man with Louie CK. And he says that, 'cause Louis is mourning the loss of, got split up, he got dumped or whatever. And he's mourning the loss\nof that partner of love. And the old man says that\nthat is the best part. Like missing the love is still love. The real bad part is when you forget it, when the pain fades.\n- [James] Yeah. - And it's all gone. But the pain is actually\na kind of celebration of the love you have.\n- Of course. Well, the opposite of love isn't hate, the opposite of love is indifference. - [Lex] Yeah. - There's no question about that. I mean, hate is a passionate emotion. Love is a passionate emotion. And there is a school of thought that says that only unfulfilled love\ncan be truly romantic. But I believe that, it's what I think I learned\nfrom hospice is that I think for me, knowing the\nimpermanence is the thing, it's the key. - Yeah, it's finite and\neventually it's gonna be over. And so like that intensifies\nthe feeling that, that's when you can have\npure love without the drama. - Dogs are, for me, a great example. And again, I don't know\nwhat it all means, right? Existentially, but I just\nfeel like they have that, that kind of love has to be\nhere to teach us something. And I feel like the fact\nthat they're so amazing and just so loving and so wonderful, and the bond we feel\nis so amazing and deep and doesn't require a lot of maintenance. And yet it's so finite. Like it's just this short little lifespan. And I feel like there's\njust such a lesson there, there's so much there to unpack about the nature of connection and loss and that your heart has\nthis infinite capacity. Like when you're, I'm telling you, when my dog died, when Buster died, I remember thinking with certainty, I will never do this again because I'll never love that way again. I'll never love a dog\nthe way I love this dog. And it's just not true. That's just not true. You have this infinite capacity, and that makes it scary actually, because like right now, there's so many people you could love. There's so many dogs you could love. Like there's so much out there, and it's requires a certain bravery and tremendous amount of risk to do it. - And a commitment, because I think to really experience\nlove is you just dive in, 'cause there is a huge number of people. But to really like, I\nmean, you have to like really dive into the full complexity, the full range of another human being. - Yeah, which is hard\nbecause we don't even, I don't know that we even feel comfortable diving into the full range of ourselves. There's pieces of ourselves\nwe try to push away or not think about or."

      "text": "- Okay. So speaking of the whole\nsociopath slash empath that is all embodied in one\nhuman being, that is you. Let's go back to some cases\nperhaps that you've worked on. Just something that stands out to you. What's maybe the craziest, most complicated thing you've worked on? Is there something that pops to mind? - Craziest would be different\nthan most complicated. - [Lex] Let's go craziest. - Yeah, so craziest, ah, gosh, that's a great question. So from a chaos standpoint, I mean, I see so many\nbizarre fact patterns and so many variations of\npeople cheating with people, people sleeping with the nanny,\npeople sleeping with the, someone, a relative of their spouse, people having same sex or\npolyamorous relationships, and the other person doesn't even know they're not monogamous. Like so much craziness that\nyou could fill 15 books. In terms of complexity, I mean, emotionally\ncomplex is any custody case is emotionally complex because you're dealing\nwith parenting issues. And what makes a good parent, I think is a very tricky\nquestion because, you know, I'm trying to convince a\njudge who's a better parent, and that is so loaded with\nsubjective value judgements. - Is there just to linger\non the maternal presumption, is that a thing you come face-to-face with often in the court? - Well, there was, I mean,\nit was real, it was the law. There was something in the law called the maternal presumption. It was also known as the\ntender years doctrine, which meant that a child\nunder the age of seven was presumed to be in\nthe custody of the mother unless you could show\nshe was an unfit mother. So that's where the idea of\nlike someone has to be proven an unfit mother came from\nnow in the '80s, 1980s, that was changed. But under my skin is under my sovereignty. I mean, you can't suggest that there isn't in the world a suggestion that\na mother who births a child and feeds a child with her body doesn't have a particular\nbond with a child that's different than a\nfather's bond with a child. So where do we put that? How much importance do we put on it. Now that there's better and more research in the mental health field about attachment theory and infants. There's also a lot of, you know, a lot of research\non how is attachment formed, how should parenting\nschedules be put together based on attachment theory. But, you know, there's\nconflicting perspectives on that. - And so as judge to judge you see like, is there a lot of variation? - Yeah, there is because\nthere's lots of kinds of judges. Like there's judges that\nare thoughtful, enlightened, interested in the mental health research. And there's judges that just want, were unsuccessful lawyers\nthat were good politically and got elected and they\njust wanna, you know, they just want a job where like they show up at nine o'clock, they have a lunch break\nfrom 12 until two o'clock and that they leave at 4:30 and they get a certain\nnumber of weeks vacation and a pension after 20 years. - So what is in general the process of these custody battles? Like what's the landscape here? - Well, most, the overwhelming\nmajority of custody cases don't end up in my office. They are a negotiation between two people that love their children more than they dislike\ntheir soon to be ex. So the overwhelming majority of cases are just two people going, okay, how are we gonna\nmake decisions together? 'Cause there are decisions that\nhave to be made about kids. Will they go to public or private school, can they go on medication\nif they need it or not, should we change pediatricians, all those kinds of things. How do we make decisions and when will we each\nspend time with the kids? And so most custody cases are just that. Most custody cases are just a discussion, a negotiation between\ncounsel about those issues. And they're not ugly and\nthey're not anything. They're just people. Again, sometimes people\nhave differing perspectives, you know, but sometimes\npeople haven't thought through their perspective. So as a divorce lawyer, a lot of what I'm doing\nis counseling a person because they come in and say, well, I've been the person who handles, all of the homework and\nall of the everything. So he should only see\nthe kids on weekends. And there's a logic to that. I've always done the\nhomework with the kids. So I'm the parent who's\nin charge of the homework and he's obviously not done that before. But there's also a logic\nthat you can then say, right? But then you're doing all the\nheavy lifting of parenting and he's doing none of that. And you were a married\ncouple and living together. So he was trusting you to do that 'cause you're good at it\nand you seem to like it. So maybe now we want him to have to do some of the heavy lifting of parenting because we don't want the\nchild when they're 13 to say, I love dad, we have nothing\nbut a good time together. Whereas you make me do my\nhomework and eat my broccoli. Dad's the grass on the other side of the fence that's greener. So sometimes it's about\neducating a client to like change their frame, you know,\nto look at this differently. Yeah, okay, we always go to\nmy mother's for Thanksgiving, so I need every Thanksgiving. Okay, well you were\nmarried so you went to, now you're gonna have new traditions, things are changing for your children, things are changing for your family. You're both gonna have new traditions. So a lot of times it's\njust educating people on looking at things in a different way, looking at their parenting\nin a different way. We're not gonna live in\nthe same house anymore, but we're still gonna parent these child, this child or these children together. What's much more interesting\n'cause like, you know, I don't get invited to a lot of parties, but when I get invited to\nparties, if somebody says, what do you do for a living?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And I say, I'm a divorce lawyer. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And they go, oh my God, you must have stories. That's the way everybody said, oh my God, you must have so many stories. And if I said, yeah, there was this couple and they, you know, slowly grew apart and then they decided that it would be good for them to end their\nrelationship as a married couple, but they wanted to continue to have an amicable co-parenting relationship. So they divided their assets, and they figured out a good\nparenting access schedule that made sure that they both had, both leisure time and\nresponsibilities with the children. People would be like, that's\nthe worst fucking story. Yeah, that's so boring.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - So what they really want is the like, and then he was sleeping with the nanny and then she caught him. So, you know, the truth is like, people want to hear\nabout those flame outs. And by the way, those are super\ninteresting as the lawyer. Like it's super interesting. - It's usually gonna be what?"

I try to explain it in the book, but yeah, I mean I've had\nsome great nanny stories. I mean, people run off with the nanny. People end up getting\nmarried to the nanny. I had one he convinced her that they should have a\nthreesome with the nanny. They got the nanny drunk. They had a bunch of\nthreesomes with the nanny and then the nanny and the\nwife paired up and left him. - [Lex] Oh, nice. - And they're still quite happy. - [Lex] That seems like a\nhappy ending the whole family. - For everyone but him,\nbut it was his idea, - Well, he's really gonna\nhave a nanny fascination now. - Now he's, yeah, well, now he's gotta see the nanny who's now the like stepparent to the kids. And it was his bright idea of let's have a threesome with the nanny. Yeah, I mean the nanny thing\nI think is a function of, in many circumstances\nis the characteristics of the wife that he remembers fondly and that have been extinguished\nby the presence of children. So my words of wisdom is\nnot don't get a nanny, or make sure you get an ugly nanny. My thought on it is that\na woman should remember even when she's a mother, that\nshe's also a woman who a man, you know, they fell in\nlove with each other and she should take time to be in touch with the part of herself\nthat is an independent woman, that's interesting and interested. And, you know, there's a lot to be learned from divorced couples\nbecause divorced couples, if you do it right, it's awesome. I had a wonderful experience\nparenting and being divorced, 'cause I divorced when\nmy kids were quite young. My co-parent, you know,\nmy ex-wife is awesome. She's a great mom, nice person. We're good friends. And it was great. I had half the time I had my\nkids and I could focus on them. And the other half of the time they were with the other\nperson who loves them as much as I do. And I didn't have any of the\nresponsibilities of kids. And I could just have\nall of the wonderful fun that you can have when\nyou don't have, you know, the responsibilities that\ncome with full-time caring for children so."

      "text": "- What would you say now\non the flip positive side, we've been talking about\nthe collapse of things, what about success? What's the secret to a\nsuccessful romantic relationship? - My mom used to say that it's\nhard to define intelligence, but you could spot stupid a mile away. (Lex laughs)\n- Yeah. - So I'm much better at pointing out where people fall apart, 'cause I spend a lot of time with people who have fallen apart\nin their relationship. So it's easy to then say, well,\njust don't do what they do. But I don't know that that's\nnot an oversimplification. So again, I think the\nanswer is connection. I think the answer is affection, presence, you know, mindfulness and presence. I do think in my personal\nand professional experience, that most people want you fully more than they just want\nyou in a disconnected way. So if you were to say to\nyour romantic partner, you can have me for two hours where I'm giving you\nmy undivided attention and I'm really joyful to be with you. Or you can have me for eight hours where I'm sort of half paying attention and I kind of want to be someplace else for part of the time. There's just no choice there. It's so obvious. So I think presence is a big piece. And I think that, the you, the me, and the\nwe, I think is important, because I think in relationships, there's you and there's me and we meet and something magical happens, you know. And we become, we. And now there's you and\nthere's me and there's we, and then the we gets bigger\nand bigger and bigger. And isn't it great? 'Cause it's such a nice warm place. It gets so big, but it gets so big that you\nget small and me gets small, 'cause we, and if any of us dares to ask, well what about you, what about me? No, no, the we, what? You don't like the we? You don't wanna be with\nthe we like, whoa, whoa. No, it's not that. But we only exists 'cause\nthere was you and there was me, and I really liked you\nand you really liked me. And so we picked each other\nout of lots of choices. And now this we is so fucking big. Like it threatens to\njust consume all of it. And I really think that there's something there we\nhave to look at more, honestly. - So we should not consume everything, but it at the same time, not be small. - Well, the we is the you and the me, and if you mix it so much\nthat you and me loses, you know, it's components\nthat all that's left is we. I don't think that\nthat's the way to do it. I just think there's a, the world pulls us in that direction. Like we get told culturally that, well, why aren't you going\nwith this person to that? Why would you do that by yourself? And why? Like anyone knows that\nthere's joy in being away from each other and there's\njoy being reunited together. So why don't we, you know,\nspeak very honestly about that. And I think some of that's\nour own insecurity, you know, well, why don't you wanna\nbe with me 24 hours a day? Aren't I wonderful? Aren't I delightful? It's like, well wait, what? - Well, but also probably\npeople are either afraid or lazy in developing\ntheir individual selves. I mean, it's still, it's lonely going out there\nin the world by yourself, and it's comforting in\nthat little cocoon of we. - I mean it can also be\nincredibly adventurous. - [Lex] Right. - Going out into the world by yourself and then coming back to\nthe we with a full report. - [Lex] Yeah. - Coming back and saying like- - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Oh my God, guess what I saw, guess what I did? I'm like, we have to\ngo there together now. Because all I could think about was you. - [Lex] Yeah. - While I was there I was like, oh my god, she would love this.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - You know, like, that's magical. That's amazing. Look what I brought you back, I went in for this and then I got you this\npresent from there. - [Lex] Yeah. - There's something, you\nknow, and we know this, I always thought it was, you know, like when you watch the old westerns, or like the hero is leaving, and he's walking away from the cabin 'cause he's gonna go fight the gunfight and she runs up and she goes, please don't go, don't go, stay here with me.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And he like kisses her and then he goes. - [Lex] Yeah. - You know, if he goes\nlike, yeah, you're right, I'll just stay here, it's cool. You know, like, this is, I didn't wanna deal with that anyway. He's not the hero anymore then. - Yeah. (laughs) Yeah, deep truth to that. And then probably like you mentioned, sex. - [James] Sex is. - Probably a big part of it. Friendship. That seems to me like\na really important one. - Depends on how you define friend. If being a friend means\nwe have some connection to each other and we have each\nother's cell phone numbers, okay, then we're friends. But if it's a bigger definition than that, if it's like you've picked\nme up at the airport, or like you're someone I could call- - [Lex] Right. - That it's like, dude,\nI gotta hide a body. Like you get shovel in a lime, you know. - I like how you escalated\nfrom airport pickup- - [James] Yeah.\n- To murder. - [James] Yeah, I try\nto go to two direction. - [Lex] You're a true New Yorker. - I tell you, I define\nthe Ben Affleck movie, \"The Town,\" that scene,\nthat's friendship to me. I mean, to me, the ideal\nmale friendship is the scene where he says, \"I need\nyou to come with me. We're gonna hurt some people and you never have to\nask me about it again.\" - [Lex] Oh yeah. - And he says, \"Whose car are we taking?\" - [Lex] Yeah. - And that's sort of like,\nto me, that's friendship. So it's a high bar, you\nknow, to be like a friend. So when you say like, friendship, I think that's the kind of friendship you should ideally have\nwith your romantic partner. If you're getting married. It should be the like\nwhose car are we taking? Like it should be that, it's you and me. - To be fair, that bar is reached with me with a lot of people. - [James] Yeah. - Like if you call me\ntomorrow, there's a body. - But you're a big open,\nyou're a big open heart. - But it's true. I wonder how many people out there are like that in terms of hiding the body. - I mean, my theory on this, 'cause I think I'm like you in that way. I think I'm very sensitive. I feel things really deeply, and I think that's a teriff, the world is terrifying when\nyou feel things very deeply, because there's so much pain,\nthere's so much betrayal, there's so many opportunities to be hurt. And I think when you\nare that kind of person, you go through like stages. And one of them is that I don't care. I don't feel anything. It doesn't matter, I don't feel anything. I don't feel anything,\nI don't feel anything. You try to convince yourself,\nI don't feel anything. It's fine, I don't feel anything. And then at some point like, you know, you do feel all of it. And then it's like, oh my God, the weight of this is crap. I mean I think it's the whole\narc of Pink Floyd, \"The wall.\" (Lex laughs) It's literally-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - The entire arc of Pink Floyd \"The Wall.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And the song \"Stop.\" I wanna go home, take off this\nuniform and leave the show. Like you just, when you feel all of it, the army of hammers coming at you, the slings and arrows\nof outrageous fortune. A thousand natural shocks,\nthe flesh is heir to. When you feel all of that deeply. It's very hard. But, but it can also be a superpower. Because I think when you can\nbring that to a relationship, when you can bring that to a profession like you've done and I've done, then there's something\nvery magical about that. The ability to bring it out in someone, to feel it in yourself, to understand it, is a gift. It's a wonderful, wonderful gift. I'm humbled by what it\nbrought me professionally. And I'd like to think that\nyou and I have both found professions that enable us\nto use that sensitivity, that empathy in a productive and good way. And in a fulfilling, a\npersonally fulfilling way. And ideally in a way that\ndoes good for other people."

      "text": "- You yourself are incredibly\nsuccessful and high performer. You've dealt with a lot of CEOs and just high performers\nin all walks of life. What can you say about\nsuccessful relationships with those kinds of folks? - [James] That's a good question. I think- - Is it all the same stuff or there's something\nspecial when they're busier? - Well, you know, I\nthink when you represent high net worth individuals,\nbut also high performing, I would make a distinction\nbetween high net worth and high performing. I've done high net worth\ndivorces where the person's like a trust fund kid-\n- [Lex] Ah. - Even though they're an adult,\nyou know, but they're like, what they did to achieve\ntheir high net worth status is their great-grandfather died. - [Lex] Sure. - So that is different than\nsomeone who is self-made, who through discipline,\nfocus, entrepreneurship, whatever it might be. That they have found success. And there's also difference\nbetween financial success and fame 'cause I've\nrepresented famous people that actually did not have that much money in the scheme of things or much liquidity. And I've represented people that, that were not in any way famous and were very high\nperforming in their field. Like in New York, we have\na lot of finance people so. And what I find is their\ndivorces are challenging. One, on a technical level because figuring out what they have and how to divide it is tricky. - [Lex] Sure, yeah. - Because when something's\nmoving that quickly, like when your portfolio's movement affects a market, that's challenging. Jeff Bezos divorce for a time when it was in its early stages\ncould affect Amazon stock. It did, you know, so that's a real thing. There are businesses that\nare affected by a divorce. But in terms of being in a\nrelationship with someone who is a high performing person. You know, most of the high\nperforming people I know are creatures of discipline and routine. From a Joe Rogan, we've talked\nabout any of these people, like they have a routine,\nthey have a discipline, they have a focus. They have a way they like to do things. They have a type of\ncoffee they like to drink. They have a way that they like to do. And divorce is a tremendous disruption. I mean, divorce is fundamental\nthings in your life are shifted out of your control. Like your spouse may be\nthe one who has decided you are no longer going\nto live in that house. You will no longer see your\nchildren on these days. So to take that control away from someone is very, very hard. I mean, when someone is a high performing, high net worth person, they are used to being told, yes, they're used to being able to buy their way out of a problem. But just like illness.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - You can hire the best doctor, but you can't cure cancer\nbecause you have a lot of money. Like you can hire the best lawyer, but you can't cure a custody case. I mean, Angelina Jolie\nand Brad Pitt's seemingly endless custody disputes that have been going on for years now with the best lawyers in\nCalifornia working on them is proof of the fact that you can't just buy a resolution to those things. That you have to go through\nit just like everyone else. - So that, lets me ask the question of how much does it divorce usually cost? - That's a great question. Average divorce, I mean\nit's sort of like a, what I always tell clients\nin the first consultation is I tell them the most\nreasonable question a person could ask me\nsitting in that chair across from me is two. How long is this gonna take\nand how much is it gonna cost? And those are the two\nquestions I can't answer. And then the next thing they\nsay is, give me a range. (Lex chuckles) Which is a bit like calling\nyour doctor and saying, \"I have a headache. What is it?\" Well, I can't tell you,\nI'd have to do tests. Give me a range. Okay. It's a reaction to the barometric pressure and it'll be gone in 15 minutes, or it's a brain aneurysm and\nyou'll be dead in five minutes. There's your range. And so it didn't really help, right? - [Lex] Yeah. - I have the least expensive\ndivorce I've ever seen is two people, one of whom comes into my office and says, we've written down on a yellow pad what we figured out at the kitchen table. She's gonna keep the house, I'm gonna keep the 401k, we have a bank account at this bank, we're gonna split that 50-50. I'm gonna pay her this much\nin child support each month. And we're gonna agree from time to time on what we're gonna do in terms of the schedule with the kids. But they're primarily gonna live with her. Can you write this up and\nmake it legally binding? Yes, 3,500 bucks. - Just as a side note, I have a friend who went through a divorce and handled it just masterfully by giving more than he's supposed to and having nothing but love in his heart and happiness with the kids. And just like, I don't know, that to me\nis just an inspiration. His whole view was like,\nwho cares about money? - [James] Well, yeah.\n- And also like, he refused with every ounce of his being to have anything but complete\nlove for the other person. - Yeah, I've had clients\nwho with a straight face will say to me like, well, I'm not gonna quibble\nover a few million dollars. And they mean it, because to\nthem it's numbers on a page. So I'll personalize this a bit. So I have a friendly\nrelationship with my ex-wife, who's the mother of my\nsons who are adults. And we have maintained a\nvery good relationship. And so now it's many years divorced later, 17, 18 years later. And we were able to sort of\npost-game that relationship, even our co-parenting relationship. We kind of post-game it when\nwe chat with each other. And I remember once saying to her, yeah, you never, you know, you never like screwed around with me when it came to the kids. You were always so like, cool, you know. Like if I called you, if I was having a really bad day at work or like see in just an ugly custody case, and like I just felt like I\nwould call her and say like, \"Hey, can I just pick the boys up and like take 'em out for ice\ncream or something tonight? I know it's not my night, but would you mind if I\njust like took 'em out for a couple hours?\" She'd be like, \"Yeah, sure, come on by.\" She was always flexible like that. And I said to her like,\n\"What was that just goodwill? You're just a good person,\nor what was that about?\" And she was like, \"Yeah,\nit was partly that,\" but she was like, it was partly that like, you never screwed around with\nme when it came to money. If the kids needed something\nor if I needed something as the mother of the kids, like, you were always like,\nyeah, sure, of course. Her air conditioning kicked out and she needed it to replace it and she didn't have like\nliquidity at the time. And I didn't have a lot\nof money at the time 'cause it was a long time ago. And I was like, all right, no, no, no, 'cause I don't want you hot and upset and I don't want the boys,\nto be in like, of course. And so I think, yeah, when you approach a conflict with like, it's very hard to argue with someone who won't argue with you. If the person approaches the argument from the point of view of like, I'm not gonna argue with you. I'm gonna absorb your aggression. I'm gonna just not meet it with that. I'm gonna meet it with love. I'm gonna meet it with positivity. It doesn't always work, 'cause sometimes people are\nso angry that they just are, they're relentless.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - But I have to tell you, the louder you get, the quieter I get, the more you seem irrational. And that's what I always try to bring\nthat to court proceedings. I always try to bring to court. Like if I know my\nadversary's coming in hard, I'll come in quiet and slow and deliberate because I want the volume to be turned up way too high over there. And then it looks like what\nit, what's the, your honor, what's their problem over there? And I think that, I say this to clients. They got a four year old, they're getting divorced, let's say. There's gonna be a wedding\nin like 20 something years. There's gonna be a wedding and it's either gonna be the wedding where they gotta put these people on opposite sides of the room, 'cause if they pass each\nother by the shrimp boat, they're gonna kill each other. Or it's the wedding where\nlike you stand there, you take some pictures,\nyou kind of go like, yeah, we fucked up this\nwhole marriage thing, but maybe we did a good job\nwith this kid, didn't we? And the decisions you make right now, there's a straight line to that wedding. And so even if you don't like this person, even if you're mad at them, even if you're mad at\nyourself for the choices you made in choosing them as a co-parent. Every single Mother's Day for 27 years, I have told my now longtime\nex-wife \"Happy Mother's Day.\" I'm so glad that we had kids together. I'm so glad you're the mother of my kids, 'cause they wouldn't be who they are if it wasn't that they\nwere part me and part you. And I'm so grateful for you, and, you know, I'm\nalways cheering for you. How hard is that? How hard is that? - [Lex] Well, it's really\nhard for some people. - I don't understand why\nit's so hard for some people. I'll tell you, I do find that hard. There's not a lot of things\nthat I kinda don't understand, but that's one that I\nkinda don't understand. Like I put in, one of the weird things I\ndid did as a divorce lawyer that caused like a little\nstir among my colleagues for a few years. With some years ago, we all steal from each\nother's work, divorce lawyers. We're like the matrimonial mafia. We all know each other, we all deal with each\nother over and over again, but we all have the same job. And so we are the only\npeople that really know the unique stresses of that job. So even though we try to\nkill each other all day, it's like boxer, like\nprofessional fighters like, yeah, your job's to take\neach other's head off, but like nobody knows what\nthe two of you went through, like the two of you.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - That's why like, I always get like, I go like all kinds of rubbery\nwhen I see after the fight. Like the two people hug each other. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Because I'm always like-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - 'Cause you know what? They relate to each other\nbetter than anybody. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- They suffered, they bled. the competitors, they bled. So I really think divorce lawyers, we have that same kind of relationship. We went through this\nstress on opposite sides, trying to take each other apart. And I find that, we all steal from each other's material when it comes to separation agreements, provisions that we use for agreements. Like all the agreements are\nlike these Frankenstein monsters of, oh, I like his estate\nplanning provisions. So I like her provisions related to maintaining a life insurance policy to secure the alimony award. And I wrote this\nparagraph or this section, because what occurred to me is that when you have a child with someone, and let's say they're\nthree or four or five, they're old enough to\nknow what Christmas is, but they're not old enough to\ngo buy a Christmas present, but they're old enough to know that you get presents on Christmas and you give presents on Christmas, but they're not old enough\nto buy one for the parent. So someone has to do that for them. So I thought, I'm gonna put\nin a provision that says that as long as the children are so young that they can't independently\npurchase a mother's day or a birthday present for the co-parent, that you'll take the children\neither to buy a small gift or to make a card, something like that. This struck me as a no-brainer, who could disagree with this? It's not for the person, it's for the kid. It's so the kid, \"Happy Birthday, Mom.\" I don't have a present for you. I don't have a card for you,\n'cause I'm fucking five. - [Lex] (laughs) Yeah.\n- Like I'm five. You can't go do that. So wouldn't you want your child, not your co-parent, who cares? Maybe you want them to have\nthe worst birthday ever, fine. But you don't want your\nchild to be embarrassed. And I even put in the provision, the parties acknowledged that it is the intention of this provision to ensure that the\nchild is not embarrassed and feels that they were able to say, I cannot tell you how many\npeople refuse to sign that. How many lawyers said to\nme, we're taking that out. And I went, \"Wait, why?\" Well, why does my client have to buy a present for your client? I said, \"They're not buying\na present for my client. They're buying a present for\nthe child to give to my client. It can be one of those\nlittle $3 boxes of chocolates they sell at the drugstore.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - Like it's a kid, they don't know. They don't know what anything is. - [Lex] Oh.\n- And people, Nope. And I have to tell you of\nthe conundrums of the puzzles that I can't figure out in existence. That's when I can't figure, I do not understand why that's so hard. - That's basically just an illustration of their complete inability\nto do anything nice for the other person. - The level, right the level of hatred, the level of vitriol that they- - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Maybe this is me, if you apologize, there's not a lot I won't forgive. I'm not saying I'll forget it. I'm not saying, \"Oh, we're totally good\nlike it never happened.\" I understand that. But if someone says what I call a non bullshit apology, right? A bullshit apology is, oh, I'm sorry, you got\nso upset when I did that. That's a bullshit apology. I'm sorry that you were offended. That's a bullshit apology. Or I'm sorry for what I did because what are we talking about? We might not be talking\nabout the same thing. Or you might be saying, I'm sorry that you found out about that, not that you did it. So a real apology is, I lied to you and I\nrealized that that hurt you, and I'm really sorry, I\nshouldn't have done that. I regret that I did that\nand I know that it hurt you and I'm really sorry. That's a real apology, okay. So someone's willing to give you that and you still wanna walk around with like, the level of vitriol that\nyou will harm your child rather than do something nice for them. I don't have a solution. And I say I see that all the time. Like parental alienation is a thing. It is a thing. Like children can be weaponized. I always tell people,\nyou wanna get married. Get married, get a prenup ideally. But if you don't have a prenup, okay, you're just risking money, don't worry. You're just risking money. Money and hassle, of paperwork and of time and of going through an\nugly financial divorce. But you have a kid with somebody, that is a missile. Like that person has a power over you for a long time, if not forever. - So the child could be used\nas part of a manipulation. - Oh, routinely.\n- [Lex] That's heartbreaking. - People weaponize children all the time, and they do it with the\npermission of their own conscience because they genuinely believe I'm gonna protect this person, this child from this person\nwho by the way is a bad spouse. But that doesn't mean they were\na bad father or bad mother. You can be bad at being a spouse, but the skillset of a\nspouse and of a parent, it's not necessarily the same. And I've seen people, people alienate children from\na parent in such subtle ways, but they're so powerful. And as a lawyer, it\ndoesn't matter what I know. It matters what I can prove. And it's very hard to prove alienation because it's usually\na very subtle process. And the example I always give to people is it's a rare kind of crazy\nperson that will say to a seven year old, \"Your\ndad is a bad person,\" but this, \"Hello. Here, it's your dad.\" You just said your dad is a bad person. You just did it with your eyes. You did it with your, the expression on your face\nwhen you handed the phone to the kid, you told that\nkid your dad is a bad person. You didn't have to say it out loud. And that is something people\nare guilty of all the time. When the kid comes home and says, these are a divorced couple. Kid comes home and says, \"Oh,\nI met mom's new boyfriend.\" And you go, \"Oh yeah, that's nice. Remember he is not your dad.\" You know, like what, whoa. Like you just told that kid\na whole bunch of information about how he's supposed\nto feel about this person. - [Lex] Yeah. - Whereas if you go, that's nice. Is he nice, oh, that's great. I heard nice things. Yeah, I heard he is\nreally, he likes bicycles. That's cool. That's really neat. Like you just told this kid, okay, it's okay, you could like this person. It's okay to like this person. It's okay that your mom\nis with this person. And again, whatever\nyou feel about your ex, your co-parent, usually you love your kid more than you hate your ex ideally. - Also, I wish people would, even without an apology,\nforgive each other. 'Cause it goes back to the\nearlier discussion we had. I usually forgive people if\nthere's something in them, especially if we shared something. But even just if there's something about them that's beautiful. It's great that they exist in the world. So I'm just grateful for that. And I use that as the fuel of forgiveness. - I dunno, to me, like forgiveness is\nvery often, it's for me. When I let go of anger, I feel lighter. I think my heart enjoys peace. I mean partly, it's 'cause\nI fight for a living. I work in the world of conflict. I jokingly used to say to my\nsons when they were teenagers, I can only argue if you've paid, (Lex chuckles) it's not fair to the paying customers. If I argue with you for free- - [Lex] That's a good line. - That's not fair.\n- Yeah. (laughs) But I think we're talking about the incredibly wide range\nthat a divorce can cost. - [James] Yeah. - And you were saying the\ncheapest one was the yellow paper? - Yeah, yellow pad. Two people came to an\nagreement, write it up, make it legally binding\nfive grand, maybe tops. But usually 3,500, five\ngrand, that kind of vibe. Most expensive, millions,\nmillions of in council fees. - [Lex] And that's because of\nthe duration, the complexity? - Yeah, the duration,\nthe complexity of issues. Like I have clients who paid two, three million\nin counsel fees to me. - So it's like, has to do custody or like what's the complexity? - It can be complex custody\nthat requires a hearing, that requires expert testimony, dueling mental health professionals opining on the parenting. It can be a situation where\nemergency circumstances occur, like where an individual tries\nto abscond to another country with the children and you\nhave to bring them back under the Hague Convention.\n- [Lex] Oh, wow. - On international child abduction. - [Lex] Oh, wow. - Yeah, we've done some Hague cases. There are cases where people have very different facts. Like before I came here today, a client of mine's soon to be ex-husband who she's in the middle of a door. He tested positive for cocaine\non a hair follicle test where it was said he was definitely not going to test positive\nand he tested positive. So it was like we were\nscurrying now with, okay, we gotta get a motion filed. We gotta suspend access. We gotta protect the kids. We gotta get in front of a judge. We gotta think about what\nare the implications of this, 'cause he was about to transition to an unsupervised parenting. Like this is the kind\nof stuff that can amp up the amount of work the lawyer has to do, which then translates to money. I mean, I get paid for my time, and the time of my team, I have attorneys and\nparalegals who work for me. When you have a team of\nlawyers working on a case, you can burn tens of\nthousands of dollars a day if it's a big enough case. There are also very\ncomplex financial cases. People move and hide money, high net, the high net worth space\nis a different world. If an average person owns a home, they own a home in their name or their name with their spouse. A high net worth person owns\nan LLC that owns that home. That LLC is owned by a trust. They are a beneficial,\ninterested party in that trust. Like this is how some of my clients who make tens if not hundreds\nof millions of dollars a year, pay less in taxes than\na cop or a firefighter, because they have structures and the structures that were designed for tax planning purposes\nthen in a divorce become very tricky to\nunwind and to figure out, wait, no, what is mine and what is not?"

      "section": "Prenups",
      "text": "- Well, then that takes us\nto the question of prenups. What's your view on prenups,\nprenuptial agreements? - It's not popular to\nquote Kanye West but, \"If you ain't no chump,\nholla we want prenup. We want prenup.\" I mean, that's what he had to say. - Meaning so that's, prenup is a good idea. - Prenup is an excellent idea. A prenup is a contract between two people that binds their respective rights and obligations in the event of a divorce when it comes to financial issues. That's all it is. There's a lot of reasons to have them and there really aren't any\nreasons not to have them, other than the fact it requires an uncomfortable conversation. - So I mean, there's a few questions here. First, do they work legally in general? - Yes, yes. If they are crafted correctly, which is not that hard\nto do for a lawyer to do. I'm saying for a lawyer to\ndo 'cause with the internet, everybody thinks why would\nI spend a thousand dollars, I can just Google prenuptial\nagreement and I can get one, and then it'll be, that is a bad idea. It is like a will, like if you're gonna have a\ndocument that binds your rights at that level, it's worth, the most expensive prenup I've ever done was like three grand. That's ridiculous. That's not a lot of money. So there's no reason you wouldn't do it. But people still, people will still, I've had clients that have\nhundreds of thousands of dollars and they did their prenup\ndownloading something from the internet and\nbecause of some imperfection. It doesn't have the right\nwhat's called acknowledgement, which is the section\nwhere the notary signs, and it has to say that it was duly sworn before this person on this date. And if it doesn't have that, it's invalid. It's not binding. So there are weird technicalities, but yeah, prenups are binding as long as there's been some\nminimal asset disclosure, which is easily done in a prenup. And as long as there's\nnot a language deficiency, meaning that the person who\nis reading it understands English to the level that they understand what they're signing. And if they don't, that at\nleast they've acknowledged in their native language that\nthere is some opportunity for this to be translated for them. Yeah, they're binding. They're presumptively binding. We live thankfully in a culture where people are allowed to enter into contracts about money. - What are some prenups that you've seen that can be effective or what that people converge towards in terms of what does\nthat agreement look like? Because the popular conception\nis when there's no prenup, both sides get half. - And that's generally true, that both sides get half, equitable distribution, which\nis what the law is called. It's the law of equitable distribution. It's not called the law of\nequal distribution for a reason, because it's equitable, not equal. Now equal, like equitable\nis presumed to be equal, but there are exceptions\nto that presumption. And that's where lawyers can get into fun and or trouble depending\non how you view it. It's where we make our money. We make our money arguing\nthat the fair result will not be just a 50/50 split. And so there's the very\ngeneric standard prenup, which is easy. I call that yours, mine, and ours. If it's in your name, it's yours, whether it's an asset or liability, my name, it's mine, joint names, we split at 50/50. Simple, clean. And you go in to the marriage now knowing what the rules are. So if you get a bonus at work and you put it in your sole name, then it's your separate property\nin the event you divorce. You go out and buy a boat and she doesn't support\nyou buying the boat, but the boat, you got a\nbig loan on this boat, you're responsible for that loan. So I like that because I like\npeople having some control. And I also like people\nhaving to have discussions. Well, why are we putting that bonus just in your bank account? Why wouldn't we put it in\nthe joint bank account? We should have that discussion\nwhile we're married, not when we're in a divorce\nlawyer's office 10 years later, because we should be able to talk about those kinds of things. So what's interesting\nabout prenups is that, that somehow people think\nthere's something like, it takes away from the\nromance of a marriage. But I've said it before\nand I'll say it again, all marriages end. They end in death or divorce. So having life insurance or having a will, it doesn't mean you can't wait to die. It doesn't mean you're\nlooking forward to death. It doesn't mean that you're predicting, your demise sometime imminently. It just means that, you're\nbeing realistic and honest. So when you marry, and I don't\nmean spiritually marrying, having a marriage ceremony. I mean, legally marrying. You're making changes to your rights and obligations under law. That's what you're doing. Like marriage, from a legal standpoint, what we mean when we say I got married is a state agency. It's been created by the state. Like this is a legal status that most people who are\nin it know nothing about. They just did the most\nlegally significant thing they're ever going to do other than dying. And they have no idea what rights and obligations it created in them. And the first time they're\ngonna get an education about it is in my office. That's crazy. - When they get divorced. - That's crazy. And so prenup is an opportunity to learn something about it at the start. - So first of all, whenever someone\napproaches me about prenups and that's like four or\nfive times a week probably, depending on the season. Right before wedding season, we get a lot. - When is wedding season? - Well, it used to just be the summer, they say when you marry in June, you're a bride all your life. That's from some Rodgers\nand Hammerstein's music. Now the fall is very big too. People love fall content, fall weddings, pretty, you know, pictures and things. - Content.\n- [James] Yeah, fall content. - It's good on gram. - [James] Hashtag full content. - All right. - [James] It's all for the gram. - The hashtag.\n- Weddings is for the gram. I have to tell you, weddings\nis performative, man. See, the problem is though, it's curated. So you'd say, here's us picking the cake. It's not, here's us doing the prenup. You know how many people\nI've done prenups for that I've watched on their social media or them being interviewed\nby Andy Cohen on Bravo and saying, \"Well, no,\nwe don't have a prenup.\" Yeah, you do, yeah, you do. You do, it's in my office. It's in a folder.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - They have prenup. - They don't even know, that's beautiful. - But prenups are not published any place. They're not filed with a court. They're maintained by the\ntwo people that signed it, and they're lawyers, that's it. So nobody has to admit\nthat they have a prenup. - Beautiful. - But there's a, yes, but there's a certain\nproblem with that insofar as, a lot of people have prenups and we need to normalize prenups. Like there's no reason\nnot to normalize prenups. There's no reason not for, until some famous people\nsay, \"Yeah, we have a prenup. We're crazy about each other. That's why we're getting married.\" But yeah, look, we're getting, you know, I don't wanna get a car\naccident, but I got a seatbelt. You know, like you have it just in case. - And I mean, what do you do\nif you're running a company? What does that have to do with a prenup? You're running a hundred billion dollar or trillion dollar company, Jeff Bezos, I suppose his marriage was before Amazon. - [James] Yeah, his was\nbefore it was anything. - But like, how does\nthat work in a prenup? - Well, no, actually, it's the same. I mean, what you're doing with a prenup is you're identifying how\nthings will be classified in advance. So you're creating a set of rules and then you both can function under those rules during the marriage. So for a brief time, I taught a family law drafting\nclass at a law school. And when we would do separation agreements and we would do pleadings,\nit was lots of fun. When we would do prenups, I\nwould say to the students, \"What's the main thing you need\nwhen you're doing a prenup?\" And they would say, \"Well,\nyou need asset disclosure.\" And I'd say, \"Well, that's\nnot the main thing.\" And they'd say, \"Well, you\nneed, technical language.\" They say, \"Nope.\" Main thing you need is a crystal ball. The main thing you need\nis the ability to see what's gonna happen in the future. Who's gonna have money, who's not, who's gonna be successful who isn't, what people will inherit? Problem is we don't have that. We don't have that. So what can we do? We can create tranches, we can create structures, we can create systems, and then people can\nlive with those in mind. You enter the game\nknowing the rules, right? So you know if this is gonna\nbe a submission only event, you know if this is\ngonna be no time limit, you know if we're after a\ncertain number of minutes, we're going into points now, okay? So I can work with that rule set and I'm gonna amend my game\nbased on that rule set. Same thing. Same thing. You're just gonna say,\nlook, what's the rule set? Let's agree on the rule set, and then let's conduct ourselves\nwith the rule set in mind. Let's plan with the rule set in mind. And I think that, and by the way, and if you're gonna cheat, you cheat with the rule set in mind, you know you're cheating, right? You know you're trying to\nget around the rule set. So prenups are, when I do\na consult for a prenup, the first thing I do is, here's what's gonna happen legally if you marry without a prenup. Here's what happens to your\nrights and obligations, then what we can change with that. There's almost no limit. You can amend anything you want to. The example I always give is, there was a case that went\nup to the appellate court where a high net worth guy\nmarried a very beautiful woman. And there was a provision\nin the prenuptial agreement that said, for every 10 pounds she gained during the marriage, she would lose $10,000 a month\nin alimony if they divorced. Here's her baseline weight as of the time of execution\nof this agreement. And I wondered if she was, like did like what a wrestler does? Like did she like, you know- - [Lex] Yeah. - Did she like bulk up up right before and then cut when she\neventually got divorced? Like is she in there\nsauna, with the suit on. And the appellate essentially said, I don't know why you married this person, having had them make you\nsign this, but it's binding. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- But it's binding. - I wish somebody would\ndo a contract like that, like the rent for this place\nwould be more expensive if I was fatter, and\ncheaper if I was skinnier. And that way I would have to weigh in- - [James] And be weigh in on it. - Like a motivation. - [James] Like some motivation on you. - Yeah, exactly. That kind of prenup is motivating for me. - What his name? I think Tim Ferris says\nthat about how he does like, he said, \"You should\nmake bets with people.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - Like it's like, if you gain this much, I gotta give you this amount of money. I think he says that in\none of his early books. - [Lex] And trying to\nmake a binding somehow, which is tough.\n- Yeah, yeah. I think when we create\nincentives of that kind, that's why like there was\nlike the no nut November or no shave November,\nsober, like all those- - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It was a competition. When people make a\ncompetition of something, they gamify something. It makes it something that people are more likely to stick with. I mean I guess a prenup\nwould be interesting. The problem is there, there's also people put in prenups what's called fidelity clauses. - [Lex] Uh-oh.\n- Yeah, yeah. - [Lex] Yeah. - Fidelity clauses, people still do these. I discourage people from doing them there. The two things that people put in prenups that I discourage people\nfrom putting in prenups, but very often people\nstill put in prenups, even with my caveat is fidelity\nclauses and sunset clauses. So fidelity clauses is,\nI'm waiving alimony, I'm waiving this, I'm waiving that, but if you cheat, I get a million bucks or I get this much alimony,\nor I get this amount. And I know the intention is to disincentivize the\nperson from cheating. It's a deterrent to have them cheat. But all it really does is just creates like an interesting\nlegal battle for lawyers. Like how did you prove\nthat they cheated or not? - Oh, right, 'cause what, yeah, what constitutes cheating also. - Right, right, is an emotional affair, and affair is oral sex, cheating\nis, you know, like what, what is, and by the way,\nhow do you prove it? - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, I was in a hotel with her, but how do you prove\nthat I had sex with her? And it's very, very, you're opening a can of worms\nwith that kind of a thing. But people sometimes still put them in. And sunset clauses. Sunset clauses is if we're\nmarried X period of time, this goes away as if it never existed. - And why is that a bad idea? - The same reason the\ncommunity property law in California is a bad idea. So the community property law is after a certain number of\nyears, I think it's seven. Everything including\nyour premarital property all becomes marital property. And the idea of that was supposed to be that if you've been married\nthat number of years, like you're in enough of\na serious relationship now that everything is one\nunit, you're one person. What it actually does is\ncreates a very uncomfortable thought experiment that\npeople have to have at the six year mark. Because now the honeymoon's kind of over, you might have a kid or two and\nyou go, okay, wait a minute. Am I so happy in this\nrelationship that I'm willing to take all of my premarital assets and throw them in the pot right now? 'Cause if not, I got six\nmonths to get divorced. - [Lex] Yeah. - And that's not, so like\nif you say to someone, if you got married tomorrow\nand then you found a company that's worth a $100 dollars\nand under your prenup, that's your separate property. But there's a sunset clause that says that your prenup goes\nout the window in 15 years. Man, at year 14 and six months. You gotta ask yourself\nsome serious questions about where's this relationship\ngonna be in five, 10 years. - That's brilliant. And that's why kids, you pay for a lawyer. - That's it. We get paid to see around corners. I get paid to be paranoid. I tell people that all the time."

      "text": "- Okay, so you mentioned infidelity. You write in the book,\nwhich everybody should get. It's a great book. It's a great read. It's a window into your soul. You in this book, right? That there's five kinds of infidelity. Do you remember, can you explain? - Yeah, I mean, what I wanted to say is that\nall infidelity is not the same. That there's different kinds. And some of them are\nmore obvious than others. There's the soulmate. That's the one I think I see most often, which is a person meets another person or rekindles on social media or elsewhere. A reconnection with another\nperson in their life. And they go, oh my God, this is the person I'm\nsupposed to be with. I'm in love. The heart wants what the heart wants. I'm leaving you for this person, 'cause I have found my true love. That's one type. And it's an incredibly common type. And there's a, you know, there are plenty of cautionary\ntales associated with that where people thought that\nthey found their someone and then it turns out it was, you know, no, it was just unfair. A man who leaves his wife for his mistress just leaves a new job opportunity open. - And we should also mention that you, you know, talk about\nFacebook and Instagram. - Oh, yes. If we were going to invent a\ninfidelity generating machine, it would be called Facebook. Which by the way is a function of the fact the book was written in 2019. I would now change it to Instagram. - Oh, 'cause you said just Facebook. - Yes. But now if I had to\nrewrite it, it would be, if we were gonna invent an\ninfidelity generating machine, it would be called meta, that would be what would happen there. - Yeah, there you go.\n- [James] Yeah, yeah. - Very tech forward. - It's was a function of what Facebook and I think Instagram also are, which is, it is a communication tool that has people looking into windows that I think are antagonistic to marriage. You're looking into the\nlives of other people. You're looking into the social lives of people\nthat you meet casually. So there was a time where you would be at your son's soccer practice and see the attractive mom across the way. And you wouldn't really talk\nto her, interact with her, if you did, it would just be at practice. But now we add on social\nmedia, those people, because for legitimate reasons, we need to maybe communicate\nabout one practices or we wanna message the person. But now it's sort of an\ninvitation to a connection. And then it, you know, there's a picture of her\non vacation in a bikini, that's very intriguing. And then you have a benign, oh, I saw you guys on a vacation. Where did you stay? You know, oh, was it good? Did you like that? Oh, that's nice. And now we're talking and now\nwe're having an interaction. And now this is how the\nspark of affairs begins. It's usually people don't\nusually meet and go, would you like to potentially\nwreck your marriage? Yes, would you? Oh my God, let's do this.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - It's much more, you\nknow, it's slowly happens. So when I talk about types of infidelity, the soulmate, the unexpected soulmate. This connection that you didn't expect. I didn't expect to fall in love\nwith this person, but I did. And the heart wants what the heart wants. And I'm sorry. That one's tough. That one's tough because it's an interesting distinction between men and women to some degree, that when a man finds out\nhis wife was cheating, the question is, did you fuck him? And when a woman finds\nout that a man cheated, the question is, do you love her? And those are different things. - I feel like there could be many and have been many books written on that. - Yeah, there have-\n- Distinction. - By much smarter people than me. - [Lex] Yeah. - I think that the soulmate thing is very, very painful for\na lot of my female clients when a man says, \"Listen, I found the one, I found the one and it's not you.\" That is really, really hard to get past. Even when it turned out to be true. I mean, I've seen some\npeople that, you know, it was an affair that turned\ninto 20 plus year marriages. So an unhappy marriage\nand then a happy affair that turned into a very happy marriage. I've not seen, there's\nnot a formula, you know, like I've been doing it long enough now that I've seen permutations\nI never would've expected. So that's one type of infidelity. The other is what I call\nthe push outta the closet, which is, and that I think happened more\noften earlier in my career, there have been tremendous strides, I think in the lesbian\nand gay community where, including marriage equality, obviously, where there's a lot of change as to people accepting people\nas being gay or lesbian. And I think that there was a time where people were having, being in the closet was\nmuch more important. You were subject to professional scorn and all kinds of things if\nyou were gay or lesbian. So people were sneaking around and having affairs with\ntheir same-sex partners, and then they get caught. And then it really was a function of the fact that they were closeted. And again, that's another\nkind of complicated dynamic because I haven't had that happen to me where a woman left me for a woman, but I'd like to think it\nwould be easier for me. - [Lex] Yeah. - Because if you left me for a man, you're saying I want one like\nyou, but better than you, whereas if you leave me for a woman, well, that's a whole\ndifferent set of equipment. I don't have that.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - So I can't, like, okay. It's not me, it's you. It's something you want\nthat I can't offer. We don't serve that at this restaurant, so it's okay.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I get it. I mean, there's a betrayal,\nthere's a sadness, whatever. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - But, you know, it's a different thing. The saddest type of\ninfidelity in my opinion, is the mistake, which is\nsomeone just makes a mistake. People do dumbest shit\nwhen it comes to sex. - [Lex] Yeah. - People just in a moment, you know, they follow temptation. Their impulse control is poor, and they do something that they, that doesn't reflect their morality or doesn't reflect the\ndepth of their feelings. If you spent enough time\nin a room with people who've cheated in a relationship and are speaking candidly to you about it, 'cause you're their lawyer. They'll say to you very openly, like, no, I really love my wife. Like, I really love my wife. I just, I don't know, I was just an idiot. Like, I just, you know, I saw this bright shiny\nobject and I went for it. I really wanted to sleep with that woman. I wanted to fuck her. I love my wife. I make love to my wife, I love my wife, but I just wanna sleep with this one. And we created a culture where one of those eradicates, the other. That's a whole nother discussion is, or is there ethical non-monogamy? Like should we, is marriage\nabout who I have sex with? Or is marriage a different\nkind of a partnership? Is it a pair bond that's about\nbuilding a life together? And where does monogamy fit into that? And people like Esther\nPerel, those are people who are making very intelligent\ndiscussions about that. - Yeah, that's a complicated one. Just to actually just linger on that."

      "section": "Open marriages and threesomes",
      "text": "How often have people with open marriages have been in your office? - Well, let's see. And this is one of those like\nfrom a research perspective, this would be flawed. Because I see the, they're in my office 'cause\ntheir marriage is falling apart. - [Lex] Yeah. - So there may be lots of\npeople having open relationships that don't end up in a\ndivorce lawyer's office. So I'd never meet them.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - But I meet a lot of people that, that was the Hail Mary pass.\n- [Lex] Sure. - Like I meet a lot of\npeople that they tried that, but in retrospect, it\nwas a Hail Mary pass. It was like, look, we've\njust figured let's try this. Maybe this'll keep the glue\ntogether on this thing. And I've also seen open\nrelationships go wrong, where we agree we're just\ngonna have sexual connections with other people, or we're gonna bring other\npeople into the bedroom, but together, lik we're gonna be\ntogether with other people or with another person. And then that connection\nof those two people like, you think it's a soulmate\nall of a sudden now. And it goes in this other because, and again, is that novelty, is that like it's the reason\nwhy I don't understand why people have the threesomes. It's kind of like when\nsomeone sings to you, I don't know where to look. I don't know where to look. If someone's singing to me.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I don't know where to look. Like it feels weird, right?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - This is a conundrum.\n(Lex laughs) No this, (laughs) I'll say this to you, this will never-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - But it's the reason I\ncan't go to strip clubs. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I dunno where to look. Like if I go to strip club, like you go to strip club\nand there's the part where the woman is on the stage and\nshe walks past each person who does a little thing\nand the next person and then next little thing. So when she's right in front\nof you, I like a woman's face. And I like a woman's body. I like both of them. So I'm looking at the woman's\nface and she's very beautiful, but she's naked and I\nthink, oh, she's naked. I should be looking at her naked body because obviously that's like, it's almost rude not to because\nshe's naked in front of me. Well, of course. So then I'm looking at her naked body, which is lovely to look at. But then I find myself going, oh my God, you're just still like, you should look at her\nface for God's sakes. - Yeah. - And then I look at her face and find myself having\nthis whole thing in my head where I'm going like, oh my God, where am I supposed to look? So I think a threesome with two women, you don't hardly know or you're\nnot an, that's different. But a threesome with a long-term partner who you're in a relationship with and a new person seems to\nme a very dangerous ground because you're gonna wanna enjoy the novelty of this new person, but you're gonna have to spend\ntime with this person after. So how much attention do\nyou spend to the new novel, exciting thing without\ncreating the impression that you don't, you're\nnot interested in this 'cause you're my favorite person, but this is fun so I wanna\njust try this for a few. But then also I don't\nwanna forget about this. It just seems tricky. - That analogy by the way, is brilliant. And also I guess it's tricky because the consequences\nof mistakes are quite high, 'cause you're gonna have to talk about it. - Right, and there's an easy way to\nmisinterpret the data, right? If I really like sleeping with my partner, but I get one chance to\nsleep with this other person, well, of course, I should indulge in that because I can do this\nanytime, what did, you know. But this person, my partner\nmight interpret that as, oh, so you're more\ninterested in her than me. Because that voice in my\npartner, that would be, you know, insecure might hear that. So just why would you even, why would you open yourself\nup to that level of chaos? - You seem to love\nchess in the courtrooms. It's the kind of intimate\nhuman chess of sorts. - Yeah, no, that's too high risk. - How do we get on threesomes? Oh, open open marriages. - Well, how do we get on threesomes? I don't know. I always wonder how\npeople get in threesomes. I figure if they like if one\nis fun, two must be better. If two is better, three must be better. Yeah, I think the way that\nthis becomes an issue is why would you have a\nnon-monogamous relationship? What is it about your\nsex life with this person that's not satisfying? And I think that that is the question that's harder to ask yourself and to try to answer with your partner. - I mean, you've said that\nthis idea of soulmates- - [James] Great business. - Is great for your business, but so like a human being in a partnership can't be everything, is that true? - I think it's unrealistic. - [Lex] \"True Romance,\" right? The document of that we\nkeep referencing here. - I think it's wonderful that we do, 'cause sometimes now people don't get that reference anymore. Like I talk to people in, when I try to teach\nnegotiation to young lawyers who come work for me, I tell them to watch the Gary Oldman scene where he offers them the Chinese food. - Yeah, why is that scene\nthe one that really? - Because it's the best negotiating lesson I've ever heard in my life. Where he comes in he's- - Just for the record.\n- Yeah. Gary Oldman plays a pimp.\n- [Lex] Yes. - And he owns, his girl is\nPatricia Arquette, right? And Christian Slater's character. The protagonist is coming\nin to tell Gary Oldman that he no longer owns this girl. Alabama is her name.\n- [Lex] Alabama. - Alabama is gonna be with him now. And Gary Oldman is amazing performance. And he's sitting in a living room with a shotgun next to him, with armed guys around him, watching television and\neating Chinese food. And he's got Chinese food\nlaid out in front of him. And Christian Slater comes in and he says, \"I need talk to you about Alabama.\" And Gary Oldman says, \"Do\nyou want some Chinese food?\" And Christian Slater sort of\ntaken aback by the question. He says, \"No, I came\nto talk about Alabama, she's with me now.\" And he proceeds to tell him\nwhat his offer essentially is. And Gary Oman says, \" You\nknow, you fucked up, right?\" And some and substance he says, you know, if you'd sat down and started\neating my Chinese food, I would've thought, who's this guy? He didn't have a care in the world just sitting down eating my Egg Foo Young. But instead you tried to be hard. And now I know you're full of shit. And so I think that scene\nsummarizes how in negotiation, the more you enter into it with that, anytime I deal with another\nlawyer and they're like, well, we'll see you in court. Okay, we'll see you in court. Like empty barrels make the most noise. Like you and I as people who've been in the\njiu-jitsu community or been, I know some dangerous people. I know FBI swat people, I know, you know, I know people that are, they know how to do things to people. And they're the calmest guys\nyou ever meet in your life. - [Lex] Yeah. - You scuff their sneaker. Oh yeah, don't worry about man, it's okay. They're quick to apology. They're just chill. - What were we talking about? - We were talking about- - Oh, wait, \"True Romance.\" Oh, the soulmate. - Yeah, soulmate. Yeah, well, you're saying\nthat this idea like with that film underlying, there's this current of like, they were made for each other. - [Lex] Yeah. - I think there's a\ndistinction between the feeling that someone is your missing puzzle piece that you're made for this person. I think what that just means is there's a lot of overlapping,\nbeautiful connections. I love them intellectually. I love them sexually. I love them interpersonally. We have some shared history. We have some shared commonalities. We were raised in the same culture, raised in the same religion. We have politically similar ideas. Like these are all, or we have totally opposite\nones, but they're complimentary. I've always joked that\nlike finding someone with complimentary pathologies, like I'm obsessively disciplined. So having a partner who's like flexible and like spontaneous\nis really good for me. And also me being like, no,\nno, no, come on, come back. We're gonna do this now. No, no, it's time to actually do this now. We're good for each other. It's barefoot in the park. It's this idea of like\nthe yin and the yang. So what I have an issue\nwith is that the definition of soulmate that I think is\nsold to so many people now is this idea that if your partner is disappointing to you in any way, meaning they're not the\nperfect travel companion, they're not the perfect\nvocabulary companion, they're not the perfect roommate, they're not the perfect\nlover, they're not the, like the odds of someone\nbeing all of those seems crazy to me. It's infinitesimally small and they don't have to be everything. If I go to a restaurant and eat 10 courses and one of them is kind of subpar and the other nine are the most amazing culinary\nexperience I've ever had. How dare I say, well, that wasn't the right restaurant. What do you mean? Like, that's a great restaurant. What are you talking about? Of course, there was one little thing. So I think it's impossible to have someone never disappoint you. It's impossible to have\nsomeone who never lets you down or doesn't say and do\nthe exact right thing at the exact right time. And to create the idea\nor expectation in anyone that your partner should\nnever let you down, never disappoint. You never not know what to say. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Is I think crazy. I mean, I find for myself, when someone, for example, loses someone, when someone loses a\nfamily member or a pet. I often say the same thing to the person. I'll either talk to them or\nsend them a text or call 'em. And I'll say, \"If I wish I\nknew the perfect thing to say because I would say it right now.\" But I know there isn't. I know that, you know,\nI don't say that part, but I know there isn't. There isn't a perfect thing to say. But if there was a perfect thing to say, I would say it right now. Love to me is not that you\nnever let this person down. It's that you never wanna\nlet this person down. It's love is a verb. It's this feeling of, I never want to disappoint you. I will disappoint you, but I\nnever want to disappoint you. I will hurt you, but I\nnever want to hurt you. When I hurt you, it will be\nmy insecurity, my stupidity, my humanity that causes me to hurt you. But I will never intentionally hurt you. I will betray your trust. I'll never intentionally\nbetray your trust. I will bite my stupidity\nsay the wrong thing or loose slip say something to someone that you didn't want me to,\nbut it won't be intentional. I'll always try to be on your team. That feels to me like a realistic thing. - Yeah, the intention leads the way, but there's some aspect of like, just the turn course meal, that over time, there's a kind of a\nconvergence towards perfection. And along the way there's\nthe rose-colored glasses where you see the beauty and everything. So it just, it feels, it's probably destructive\njust to really internalize the idea of soulmate. Because then any imperfections\ncan make you doubt, can make you step away, can make you lose the connection. But it just feels like, I don't know. - It's too heavy. It just feels, I feel like when you see a\ncouple that's 90 years old and they've been together\nfor 60 years, 70 years, there is of course a temptation to think about all the beauty that they've seen on\nthat journey together. The children, the grandchildren, maybe the great-grandchildren, all the joy that they've seen, all the pain they've endured\nand struggled together, but they've also disappointed each other a whole bunch of times. Probably let each other down. They probably lied to each other a bunch. - [Lex] Yeah. - And yeah, and to me\nthat is a beautiful thing. Like that's what, that that is not, it's great in spite of that, it's great because of that.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - They still love each other, even though they've been\nso flawed and imperfect, and they're human and they\nstill love each other. They still rode that thing together because the reasons to do so, were greater than the reasons to not."

      "text": "- We've mentioned some of this, but I'd love to get your opinion on having seen things gone wrong, and having mentioned Amber\nHeard and Johnny Depp, how much fighting do you think\nis okay in a relationship and how to resolve the fights such that they don't escalate to that disconnection? Is there some wisdom you have for that? I imagine you've seen some epic fights. - Yeah.\n(Lex laughs) I've seen some crazy fights. I have, even on my phone,\nI have some recordings, 'cause now there's cameras everywhere. It's like nest cams and ring cams. And so a lot of this gets recorded, and people, you know, have\nphones so readily available that they can record and the\nother person didn't know it. And I listen to the way\npeople speak to their, first of all, I listen to the way people\nspeak to each other, and I'm shocked. I listen to the way people\nspeak to their romantic partner, to their spouse. And I'm blown away. I'm blown away. - [Lex] Disrespect or what? - Just disrespect, insults, profanity, just degradation, just\nbrutality, just, just, and then like to then kind\nof go on like the next day you kind of go on like nothing happened. I'm shocked by it. I mean, I listened to it and I think like if someone ever spoke to me that way, I don't know that I could ever really feel deep connection to them, like freely. I would feel so betrayed like that. They just so brutal.\n- [Lex] Right. - I can't imagine speaking\nto someone that way. Like saying just such\nvicious insults to someone. But I understand that's how\nsome people communicate perhaps. I guess the question of how much fighting is too much fighting in the relationship? Is for me, a bit like the question, how much sex is enough\nsex in the relationship? - [Lex] Yeah. - It depends on the two people\nand their individual tastes. But what's problematic is\nwhen there is a disconnect between the two people. - [Lex] Sure. There's a, I think it's Annie Hall, it's one of the Woody Allen films where Diane Keaton and\nWoody Allen are both talking to their respective therapists\nabout the relationship, but it's like a split screen.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And she says, I mean,\nwe have sex all the time. We have sex like once a week.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And he goes, we never have sex. We have sex like once a week. - [Lex] (laughs) Yeah. - And you know, it's\nfunny because it's true. It really is this, they both know the same data, but they're interpreting that data set completely differently. And I think it, you know, the question you have to\nstart asking is like what is, Steve Harvey actually once\nsaid something funny to me. He said that success is not where you are. Success is where you are in\nrelation to where you started. - [Lex] Yeah. - He says, 'cause if\nsuccess is where you are, Oprah's got a all beat.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Or maybe Elon's got us all beat. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I don't know. But if it's where you are\nversus where you started, 'cause there's a lot of\npeople that started on second and started on third act\nlike they hit a double. Like well, I was given 10 million, but then I turned it into a 100 million. Well, the first million's the hardest. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So, you know, come on. But I think the question of like, how much sex were we having at the beginning of the relationship, that might be the wrong gauge, 'cause that's like we couldn't\nkeep our hands off each other and we just, it's novelty. But, you know, like how far, how much sex we're having post children versus before the children,\nthat might be worth looking at. You know, like how do we compare it? Am I overweight compared to what? When I was 20 and running\nmarathons or most 50 year old men? I don't know, I gotta, what do you compare it to? So I think fighting, there are some people that\nI think they enjoy fighting, like they enjoy argument. I know people that enjoy political debate. I don't particularly\nenjoy political debate. Not that I'm not very interested\nin political concepts, economic concepts. I just, I argue for a living. So in my free time, I don't find argument that\nenjoyable when it's intense. I find discussion more interesting. - That's so interesting that you just keep the battle\nto that particular, to your main profession-\n- [James] Sure. - And everywhere else you want peace. - Well, did you ever,\nyou know, Bob Goldthwait Bobcat Goldthwait, the\ncomedian, very, very funny. And he had a whole second chapter as like a director and a writer. But he has this, you know, I saw an interview with\nhim once where he said, yeah, he says like, I'm a comedian. I've been a comedian a long time. People always come up\nto me and they're like, \"Oh, you're a comedian, do\nyou want to hear a joke?\" - [Lex] Yeah. - He's like, and all I can think is, oh yeah, that'd be a real fucking treat. - [Lex] Yeah. (laughs) - Like I haven't heard jokes\nall day, all night for years. That would be a real\nspecial occasion, yes. I get it, you know. - Yeah, and I mean a sadder story of, I've been reading quite a\nbit about Robin Williams and- - [James] Yeah. - His wife would talk about\nhow quiet and introspective and thoughtful and\nintellectual he was and- - [James] Right. - Not really that humorous\nin his private life. - But that may be a function of, that it is enjoyable\nto be the other thing. - Yeah. - One of the things I've\nalways thought was very funny in relationships, my own relationships is, most women I know who have a husband who doesn't wear a suit\nevery day for a living, when their husband gets dressed up, like they're going to\na wedding or something, they get like, oh my God,\nlook at him, you know, and I wear a suit every day, on the weekends I don't\nwanna wear like jeans and a black T-shirt, but the\nrest of the time I wear a suit. And I remember, I think this has been\ntrue in every relationship I've been in since I was a\nlawyer, including my ex-wife. It was always like, if I had on jeans and I wasn't shaven, it was like, look at you.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - It's like, are you kidding me? (Lex laughs) - I'm like really?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Whereas the suit, they\nwouldn't even notice. - [Lex] Yeah. - Wouldn't even notice the suit. - [Lex] Sometimes the other thing. - Well, that's what it is. It's the novelty of the other thing. So I think that if you're Robin Williams and you're like being shot out of a canon in terms of your performative style and your energy and explosive. Yeah, being quiet must be very refreshing. I imagine, you know,\nincredibly intelligent people must love just watching\nstupid humor or having a dumb, it's why some of the\nsmartest people I know, like really dumb shit.\n(Lex laughs) It's why like Rick and\nMorty I think is brilliant. - [Lex] Yeah. - Because it's both smart-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And dumb.\n- [Lex] Yeah. It's the perfect combination. - It really is, yeah. I think it's possibly the perfect show. - Is there advice you can\ngive to somebody like me on how to interview well, how to do conversations well? Do you think there's\nsomething transferable from the courtroom to this\nsetting with complicated people? - Yeah, I think so. I think what can be\nlearned about interviewing is the distillation. What is most important? When I hear a story that I\nhave to present to a judge, the totality of someone's parenting, the good of their parenting,\nthe bad of their parenting, the good of the other parent,\nthe bad of the other parent. I have to sort of boil down\nwhat are the best examples, 'cause I can't lay it all out. And then what greater\nprinciple do they speak to? You know, the best jiu-jitsu teacher that I think I've had as Paul Shriner, and Paul doesn't just\nteach you techniques. He's teaching you ways of thinking about concepts in jiu-jitsu. And then here are some\ntechniques that illustrate that. John Danaher, from what I can see, does a lot of that as well. I think they're like soulmates\nin the jiu-jitsu world. - Yeah. And then there's that\nelement that you spoke to, which is maybe considering\nthe other side, right? - Well, always, always. - Devil's advocate kind of thing. - Yeah, I mean, straw man, steelman stuff. You do a lot of that. And I think all the best interviewers do. But yeah, I think it's\nreally, really important to think about, I have to know the other side's case much better than my own. I have to know what are their defenses, what are their strengths? I have to map out a strategy\nthat keeps those in mind. And that's hard because\nearly in my career, I would attribute to the\nother side an intelligence and strategy that sometimes\nwasn't applicable. I've learned, there's like the simplest\nexplanation is the accurate one. The Occam's razor, I think like sextons would be never attribute to strategy that which could be attributed\nto stupidity for laziness. - Yeah. - Because I have lots of\nadversaries that like, they'll not file a motion I\nthought they were gonna file. And I'll go, wait, why\ndidn't they file that? Like tactically what are\nthey thinking I'm gonna do? And what is that about? And I would go, well, if I didn't file it, why wouldn't I file? And the answer is like, they\njust didn't think to file it. Or like they were too lazy to draft it, or they went on vacation last week so that's why they didn't, and I'm driving myself crazy going, there's some tactical\nreason, there must be. So I think you have to look honestly and don't attribute to the\nother side your constitution, if I said that, I'd be\nsaying it sarcastically. If you said it, maybe you\nweren't saying it sarcastically. Like you have to think about the fact that we're unique human beings who express themselves differently. - And for you, the audience\nis usually the judge. - It's a judge.\n- Do you do jury? - No, we don't do jury trials. That's the interesting thing\nabout family law attorneys. Family law attorneys don't do jury trials. We do bench trials. We just persuade there's\nperson in a black robe. That's the only person I have to convince. - Does the person in the black\nrobe, do they have emotions? Are they human or are they very? - They are human. They are all too human. - Do they impose that humanity on you? Like do you feel it? - Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. Oh no, do you feel it? Like they're human.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - They're working their shit out. - [Lex] Okay. (chuckles) Their parents.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - They're husbands and wives.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And you're talking about\nstuff they deal with. - [Lex] Yeah. - I had a woman on the stand, an expert witness on the stand who was talking about the emotional and physical abuse that was\nperpetrated on a seven year old. And this person had\nwritten a bunch of reports that were in evidence in this trial around like day six or seven in the trial. And there's all of this\ninformation in the record about this verbal abuse and mental abuse and gaslighting and like\nreally intense stuff that this woman's doing\nto this seven year old. And the judge is like\nvaguely paying attention for most of the time. And at some point the person says, well, when a parent is\nabusing a child, da, da, and the judge just interrupts, she goes, well look, you know, do you think like if a\nperson spanks a child that that's abuse? She's like, well, I like\na person in general. And by the way, if my\nadversary asks that question, I could object, but I can't object when the judge asks the question. They get to rule on that objection. So I'm like, where's this going? She's like, well, no, I mean, spanking can be a form of abuse. She's like, right, but like, you know, are you saying like everybody who spanks and I'm sitting here going,\nwhat is going on in your house? - [Lex] Yeah. - What went on with your parents? 'Cause you're bringing\nsome stuff here that's not, this is not what you're supposed to be. This is not your role. But there are good judges and bad judges, and that's a big, big deal. - Well, I've noticed that\nnow I don't have kids, so I have a certain\nperspective on the world. I really wanna have a\nfamily and have kids. But I've noticed when I talk\nto people that have kids and gender matters also, like fathers with daughters and so on. It changes the landscape\nof the conversation. - [James] It sure does. - It's like you're no longer\nthis intellectual that's like, well, there's this and there's this. It's more like go fuck yourself. Anything that with kids.\n- [James] Yeah, yeah. - Can like burn it to the ground. I don't care.\n- [James] Yeah. - I don't care what the nuance is of the little intellectual thing. - Oh, you wanna learn about this, represent someone who's\naccused of child sexual abuse. I've had about a dozen of those cases where I've represented someone who's alleged to have perpetrated\nsexual abuse of a child. You are guilty until proven innocent. And let me tell you, as a lawyer, that is the toughest\ncases because you put sex and kids together and everyone loses their\ngod damn mind, immediately. There is a rush to judgment. There is a disregard for procedure. There is a confirmation bias. There's a desire to be a protector. And again, all motivated and\ninformed by really good things. The desire to protect the innocent. The desire to protect the vulnerable. But gang, no, like we have these, I like living in a world\nthat has due process. I like these rules.\n- [Lex] Right. - I like the rules of evidence. I like innocent until proven guilty. I like that. I'm not saying it's perfect. - It's such a I'm so torn on it because I also like living in a world where people are so emotionally invested in connection to other like- - Those two things aren't\nmutually exclusive. They shouldn't be. - I know, but if you dedicate\nyourself fully to the law, you might lose some of the humanity. - I don't think you have to. I have to tell you, I once\nactually went off on a DA, on a district attorney\nwho was very vehemently prosecuting a child sex abuse\ncase that I was involved in. And I remember, I came in, thankfully I came in\nvery early in the case. So the accusation was made\nand I came in right away, 'cause very often you get this case. There've been 15 interviews. This person's been interviewed by police, by child protective services. And it's like they've already, they're already so far down a hole they didn't even know they\ndug themselves into, you know. So I got in very early on\nand I just kept saying, she's like, \"Well, we're gonna do this. We're gonna do this, we're gonna,\" I was like, \"Wait,\nwait, wait, wait, wait.\" We should both want this\nto be fair, done properly. There's an expert, like a well-respected expert\nwho's a clinical psychologist who they're job is, they're\na validation expert. So their job is to interviewed a child. They record the interviews\nwith a hidden camera so that everyone can see. They didn't have suggestive questioning. There are very stringent\nstandards that they follow, to prevent like suggestive questioning or any of those kinds of things. And I was saying, \"Listen, no, no one should be interviewing this child other than this person who's\na neutral, qualified person.\" And I kept saying to the other side, like, wait, no, no, see, this is the problem. You wanna win, you're a\nlawyer, you wanna win, I wanna win too, right? But we wanna win fair. Like, that's like saying, you know, I'm going into a boxing\nmatch, I wanna win. So if the referee's looking to the side, I'm gonna kick the guy in the nuts. Okay, then you might've won,\nbut you didn't win boxing. You won some other thing. I wanna win a fair fight. I want to go in with\nthe rules set, the law, the rules of evidence. I don't want a judge who\ndoesn't understand evidence. I don't want an adversary\nwho plays it fast and loose with the rules. I wanna go in and win a fair fight. And that's when it comes our passion to protect the\ninnocent, to emotionally connect, to feel deeply about\nchildren and protecting them, I don't think that that's antagonistic to. We always treat dandruff with\ndecapitation in this culture. And I don't understand it. And that's what I like about the law. The law, there's rules, and there's rules about procedure. And so that's our job is\nto bring out the truth using the rules and the procedure. I love that job. - But still there's a human\nbeing and the judge, right? - That's the problem. - It seems like a really hard job. It's a because you have\nto be pay attention to the whole thing. - You have to pay attention\nto the whole thing. And everyone is trying to\npersuade you and lie to you. - [Lex] Yeah. - And everyone can keep\ntheir shit together in a court appearance most of the time. - [Lex] Yeah. - It takes a rare, kind of\ncrazy to blow up in a courtroom. So most of the time everybody\nlooks really put together and like, yeah, you gotta have\nan amazing bullshit detector. I'm not saying they don't\nhave a really hard job. They have a really hard job. They have a way harder job than I have. - What's their source of ground truth? Like how do they sharpen\nthe radar for bullshit? - I think that they're\nassessing credibility, which is what you call it in\nthe law is something that, I think you're supposed\nto develop it on the job. - Do you have the data of who\nwas lying in the end or not? - No, not really. Not really, I mean, you can\ntry to demonstrate a lack. What I always tell clients, and this is the art of advocacy, right? Is I want to use examples\nof misrepresentations to show that this person's a liar. I'm trying to extrapolate\nfrom the small, the large. I'm trying to say, here's\nthree times he lied, therefore he's a liar. When in fact, we know human beings don't\nreally work that way. But I've seen people submarine, just torpedo their entire case because they lied about some dumb shit, some dumb little thing. And I say to 'em, why would you lie? Why did you lie about that? I had a case where a person was accused of child sexual abuse. And on cross-examination they were asked, did you have an affair\nwith this babysitter? And they were like, no, no, no, no, no. And then it was shown through\ntext messages and things. They clearly had an affair\nwith the babysitter. And I said, \"Why did you lie?\" And they said, \"Well, I\ndidn't want that to come out.\" And I said, \"Right,\nbut now you're a liar.\" Did you molest your child? 'Cause if the answer to that is no, and now you destroyed your credibility 'cause you didn't wanna admit that you slept with an adult woman, by the way, it would've\nbeen good for your case. It would've been good for\nyour case for you to say, yeah, I slept with her 'cause I like sleeping with\nadult women, that's how I am. I don't sleep with\nchildren much less my own. You know, so why would you lie? And so that concept is\nincredibly important. And judges, theoretically, they have to make very tough calls. I feel like it's the most\nimpotent place to just sit there and dispassionately sort of\nlisten and rule on objections. I just would be so frustrated, 'cause I'd wanna get up and\nI had to do jury duty once. And it was like a\nhorrific experience for me because I'm sitting there and I'm- - You have no power, you're just- - Yeah, I'm just watching\nthese two lawyers. I'm like, why did you ask\nthat question that way? I would never have asked it that way. Why would you object? Like when you object, you\nbring more attention to it, what are you doing? I'm watching both of them. It's like watching, like a jiu-jitsu probably\nwouldn't feel like for like John Donaher to\nwatch two white belts spar. Why are you doing, wow, my\nGod, what are you doing? Why would you grab that? What are you thinking? And, you know, it's frustrating. It's frustrating to watch. And as a judge it must\njust be unbelievable. - So divorce lawyers\nsometimes get a bad rep. Is there a reason for this? - I mean, no one's ever happy to be spending time with a divorce lawyer. Like if you have a criminal lawyer, they're defending you against\nthe maelstrom of injustice and false allegations. They're protecting your freedom. And maybe you're acquitted\nand then you're like, oh, that person saved me, you know. You buy a house, you know that lawyer\nhelps you get the house, you know you're happy about\nthat, sign the paperwork. You do a will, like you help\nthey make you feel secure. At best, I'm a representative of a chapter in someone's life that\nwas very unpleasant. I have a friend who's a Julliard\ntrained classical pianist, and he was having a\nhumidification system installed in his home because his piano required a certain level of humidity and it was very expensive to install this humidification system. And we went out to dinner and\nthen we came back to his place and he said, \"Man, this is the most depressing\n$15,000 I've ever spent.\" And I said, \"Why?\" And he said, \"'Cause\nthere's nothing different. I spent $15,000 and I feel\nabsolutely nothing different. My piano does, but I don't.\" I don't have anything to show for it. You finish getting divorced, you don't really have\nanything to show for it. - Yeah, at best. - [James] Yeah.\n- At at best, it's the same. - It's one of the things I think that's interesting about divorce is in our increasingly\nperformative society. You can't pretend you\nmeant to get divorced. You can't. Like everything everybody does, well, I wrote that album for me. It didn't matter that it\nwas not gonna be popular. No, you wanted that album to be popular. Come on, you're lying, and that's fine, but you're lying. Oh, I think my haircut came out great. I wanted it to look this fucked up. No, you didn't. You didn't, you're lying. And that's fine because\nwe live in a society now where everybody's just, oh\nyes, I meant to do that. Okay, divorce. Nope, you got married. You break up in a relationship,\nnot a marriage, okay. Well, we were only gonna be\ntogether for a little while. It was never serious. We were just like we were having fun. That's all it was, it wasn't. We were never gonna be\na happily ever after. No, you got married, you got married guys, you got up there and you said forever. And it didn't go forever. So you can't bullshit anybody anymore. No, it didn't go the way\nyou thought it was gonna go, didn't go the way you signed on for. So now that, that's undeniable. Like what can we make it? What can we make it into? Like it can be beautiful, the Barnes burned down,\nnow I can see the moon. Let's make it something. And so for me, I think people look at a divorce lawyer and they just go, yeah. This is this horrible chapter and I associate you with it. Also too, listen, some\nof the things we do, it's difficult to simultaneously prevent and prepare for war.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - The things you do to\nprotect your clients sometimes look like acts of aggression, but really they're just\ntrying to shore up a defense. And so I get paid to be paranoid and I have to say to\nclients sometimes like, \"Well, are you sure that\nthey're not doing this?\" And then they go, \"Well, I don't know.\" And I go, \"Well, let me inquire.\" Did she accuse me of that? No, no, I'm not accusing you.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I'm just trying, we get a reputation divorce\nlawyers as amping up conflict, 'cause we get paid for\nthe conflict, right? It's like if you get paid by the bullet, you're gonna start a\nlot of gunfights, right? It doesn't really work that way with most good divorce lawyers. There are plenty of people\nthat are bad lawyers and they stoke up conflict\nbecause it jacks up fees. They usually don't do well. They don't build a successful career, 'cause you live and\ndie by your reputation. - [Lex] Yes, reputation is everything. - But good lawyers, like good experienced divorce lawyers. We do the whole, you know, Hey, listen, you're gonna\nsay this, I'm gonna say this, you're gonna do this, I'm gonna do this. This is what, let's skip it. We're gonna end up here. We got judge, blah, blah, blah. And you know what he's gonna do? He's gonna go right here. So why don't we just agree\nright now to X, Y, Z. Sounds good, we're done, we're good. - So you wanna minimize\nthe number of bullets. - It's like the two, it's\nlike Miyamoto Musashi. It's like the two swordsmen\nwho see each other and they just stand there at the edge and they see the whole\nfight in their minds and they know who won and\nwho lost and they walk away. (Lex laughs) We do a lot of that. We do a lot of, okay. It's like when you watch high level chess. - [Lex] Yeah. - And someone resigns and\nyou go, wait, what happened? He didn't wait and you go, no, no, the other guy won.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - It's 15 moves from now, but he won and the other guy sees it. So now we're done."

      "section": "Kevin Costner's divorce",
      "text": "- Can you speak to some\nrecent high profile divorces? Like the most recent I\nsaw is Kevin Costner. - Yeah, Kevin Costner is a\ngreat, I mean, I don't know him, I'm not involved in the case. - By the way, \"Yellowstone\"\nis just so great. - Oh, it's so good, right? - And I hope Matthew McConaughey, who I've gotten to know, I hope he's does one of these shows. \"Yellowstone\" or anything else. He's just born for the\nrole, frankly, but anyway. - Yeah. He'd be amazing in that. Yeah, your conversation\nwith him was a great one. The Kevin Costner divorce is interesting because Kevin Costner had\none of the most expensive from a distributive award perspective. He gave a huge payout to his first wife, and then this time, he had a prenup. So it's actually, it's a very public showing of the fact that once bitten, twice shy, like he had a very public\ndivorce that cost him a lot of assets in terms\nof the division of assets. And now it appears by\nall acknowledged reports that he had a prenuptial agreement that was well-crafted and enforceable. The argument now is over\nwhat is child support? What is spousal support? What's covered in the\nprenup and what isn't? - So it seems like the\nprenup worked, actually. - The prenup worked, and Kevin Costner's career, which has always been a steady career. I don't know that in the\nlike Hollywood stock market that people would've bet on \"Yellowstone.\" Like I don't, I think you would've said, Hey, the best years of that\nguy's career are behind him. How do you get better\nthan \"Dances with wolves,\" and \"Robin Hood\" and\nlike all these big, big, \"The Bodyguard.\"\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And then \"Yellowstone\" and it's like, holy cow, did he knock\nthat outta the park? And he's central to it. I mean, he knocked the skin off the ball. So I think that's why\nprenups are important. You don't know what\nyour career is gonna do. You don't know where it's gonna go. And so he saved himself a lot of money. He also has a great lawyer. He has Laura Wasser, Laura Wasser is LA, just a top professional, brilliant lawyer, even tempered, but\nintense in the courtroom and just a smart, smart human being. - The thing I liked just, you know, I haven't been following it, but I saw a few comments he's made and he like refused to comment negatively about his spouse and just- - That's smart. - But like, the way he said\nit, it wasn't lawyer advice. It's good lawyer advice probably, but he said it from the\nheart, which I always like, I like seeing that.\n- [James] Yeah. - Like where he refuses even the drama, even the public nature of it to- - [James] Yeah.\n- Throwing jabs or- - Well, Laura his lawyer is\nactually notorious for like, not speaking to the press\nabout cases in an extended way. And that's smart move. I don't speak about pending\ncases I'm involved in publicly, and I discourage my clients from doing so. I can't always stop them, but I discourage them from doing so. I don't think there's\nany good to come of it. There are lawyers who try things in the court of public opinion. I think there is a, to take it to the broader\nprinciple you just brought up, I think there is a lot of value in talking about your ex in a favorable way. I have to say, when I first\ngot divorced many years ago, I went out on a date with a young woman. It was one of my first\ndates as a divorced man. And she was a divorced woman\nand she's a beautiful woman. And we were having dinner\nand it was going quite well. And it was one of those\nthings where I was like, oh, I definitely wanna\nsee this girl again. And I said something about, \"Oh, there's gonna be\nthis thing at this museum, we should go.\" And she's like, \"Oh yeah,\nthat'd be a lot of fun.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, we should definitely, maybe we'll be next thing we do together.\" And she was like, \"Yeah,\nwe should go next weekend. The kids are with asshole so we can go.\" And I just, it was like, you could hear that record scratch like, I just went, \"Oh yeah,\nno, this isn't good.\" I'm not, you're referring\nto the father of your kids is the asshole. We're already, I'm walking\ninto something here that I don't know that I\nwant to be involved in. - Yeah. - Matthew McConaughey\nbefore he was married. If you look at his history, he dated some of the most\nbeautiful women in Hollywood in their prime. And none of them ever talked\nbad about him in the press. They all were like, \"Oh my\nGod, he is such a great guy. He's such a great guy.\" And I always wondered like how do you, he got outta all of those relationships without a scratch on him. And when you'd watch\nan interview with him, they would say like so, you\nknow, you dated Penelope Cruz, and he'd go, Penelope,\nthat's just a special lady. That's just a what a special lady. She's just a wonderful,\nwhat a wonderful woman. I was just so blessed to\nhave the time with her. What a beautiful, wonderful woman. And I would think to myself,\nI'm like you're a genius. Like he's a genius because like he'd never came off as petty.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Spiteful, bitter, any of that. He just came off as like just dignified, strong, smart, self-assured. And like, it left, you know, it left like, it left the viewer with\nthe impression that like, when he was looking off and basically, he's probably like just thinking about some wonderful time he had with her. And you think to yourself\nlike, God, that guy, like he just became cooler and cooler. - [Lex] Yeah. - Whereas if he got into like the whole, oh yeah, that was ugly\nand then this happened, and nobody wants to hear it. It's awful. - The funny thing about\nhim just having interacted with him a bunch, I\ndon't think he's in the, he's in the Rogan School\nof thought I think, that I don't see him ever having a fight. Now his parents were as he is spoken about a\nbunch, nonstop fighting. - [James] Right. - They got divorced and remarried and- - [James] Yeah.\n- Just insane. - [James] And they were volatile. - Yeah, very. And he seems maybe you kind of, it depend on swinging the other way. He just seems cool as\na cucumber like always. - Just lets it roll off. But, you know, even if it's internally. - [Lex] Yeah. - Not rolling off, there is value in just rising above it in your discourse. - That's true, yes, yes. - Like you lie to your children. People say this to me\nall the time, clients. They're like, you know, why did you tell your child\nthat dad had an affair? Well, I'm not gonna lie to my kids. Fuck you, yes, you are. You lie to your kids all the time. - [Lex] Yeah. - Mommy, are you gonna die someday? Yes, babe, I'm gonna die\nand daddy's gonna die. And then someday the Earth's\ngonna hurl into the sun and we're all gonna die. Sweet dreams. Like that's not, you lie\nto your kids all the time. What's wrong with me? We don't know what's wrong with you. We're gonna take you to the doctor and hopefully, it's nothing\nserious and you won't die. You lie to your kids all the time. You tell 'em that Santa Claus\nexists when he does whatever. So to say, I'm not gonna lie to my kids. You lie to your kids all the time. You don't like your husband, that's okay. You don't like your ex-husband,\nbut it's their father. So just grin, you know. Oh, daddy took me to meet\nhis new girlfriend, Kiki. Oh, that's nice. Did you guys have a good time? Good, oh, that's, yeah, and she helped me do my\nhair and she did my makeup. Listen, I'm sure that's\nburning you inside. - [Lex] Yeah. - But you go, oh, that's\ngreat, because why? You love your kids. - I mean, again, McConaughey\nhas a way bottom with that. He's like, he basically says never lie, but a little bullshit is okay. - [James] Sure, sure.\n(Lex laughs) Yeah. - I mean, I'm very like, Tom Waits has that song \"Lied to Me.\" You gotta lie to me, baby. Honesty is a funny thing. - But Tom Waits also believes\nthat God's way on business. - I think his words man. - And who are the ones\nthat we left in charge? Killers, thieves, and lawyers. That's a Tom Waits quote. - Well, it must be true then. - [James] Yeah. (laughs) - I don't know how many limbs I have, but I will give all of\nthem to talk to Tom. And he's a very private person. - I feel like he's the musical equivalent of Cormac McCarthy.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Even if you get the\ninterview, you're not, I don't think gonna get in there. - No, I don't think you want like, honestly, I don't think you want to. I think I've seen his public\ninterviews over the years with Letterman and I think he just, he is the poetry. - I would put Tom Waits, Cormac McCarthy, Maynard James Keenan, these\nare artists that like, I think they want the\nart to speak for itself. They would like to be lessened. They don't want you to, I remember early, early days of tool, he could not have been less\ninterested in the spotlight. - [Lex] Yeah. - To the point where I think it was almost to the detriment of the band early on. And there's no surprise\nthat those are three artists that I think are unbelievable and in a category of their own. And that you hear their performance. Like you can give me a page\nof a Cormac McCarthy novel and I'll know it's a\nCormac McCarthy novel. You can a few notes of\nMaynard James Keenan or Tom Wait's voice, you\nknow that that's them. - Yeah, as genius. Genius hides from the spotlight. But doesn't stop me from\nfeeling sad about it. But anyway.\n- Yeah, that does. I would like to hear that interview. - She's the girl that got away. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, I'm just standing\noutside of that girl's house with a blue box.\n- With a sign. Yeah, just playing in your\neyes with Peter Gabriel, yeah. - Yeah, anyway, what does it lie to me?"

      "text": "This whole idea of honesty in\nrelationships is interesting. I mean, clerks with the blowjobs. - [James] Yeah. - I don't know how to phrase\nit eloquently, but like, there's stuff you should be honest about and there's stuff maybe you\ndon't need to be honest about. - So in the law, it is\nillegal to commit fraud. Fraud is a material\nmisrepresentation of fact. But the law specifically says you are permitted to engage\nin quote, \"mere puffery.\" - [Lex] Nice. - Puffery.\n- [Lex] puffery. - And that's the term that\nwas used for it, puffery. And puffery is when you\nare inflating something, you're being like hyperbolic. But people wouldn't necessarily think you're telling the truth, like that it's not, you know, like if I say to you, this bottle of water was held by Elvis and that's why you should pay\nme $50 for it, that's fraud. But if I say, this is\nthe water that has been, this water has drank by the finest people, presidents drink this water. Now this is puffery. Advertising marketing is based on puffery. It's not fraud. When it's fraud, it crosses the line. So there's a different between\nhonestly and candor, right? So in relationships, being honest is good, being totally candid is\nprobably not a great idea. It's indelicate to be totally candid, about something things. The woman you're in a\nromantic relationship with says to you, \"Do I look\ngood in this dress?\" And they don't. Do so I look fat in this? That's a better. Any heterosexual man who's\never been in a relationship has had that question asked of him, \"Do I look fat in this? Does this make my butt look big?\" Or does whatever it is\nthis, do I look fat in this? If you go, yes, that's\nindelicate, it's honest, but it's indelicate and\nit's almost mean, right? And if you say no, but it's true, she doesn't look good in that. Like the concern she's sees\nis a legitimate concern. Do you lie and go, no, no,\nyou look great in that. It's great, da, da, da. That's not a good thing either. So what do you say? You know, that blue dress you have really compliments your body, like in a way that one doesn't, you know that, the cut\nof that dress is such that it doesn't flatter you. I see what you're saying.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Now it's the dress, it's\nnot you babe, you know, but I'm telling you the truth. Like I'm addressing your concern. This is the distinction. Don't material misrepresent the facts. Like don't steer people down\nroads that they're, you know, you know that that's not\nhow it's gonna go, right? So it's like if the\nwoman says, I love you, and you don't love her,\ndon't say, I love you back. You do the like, oh, you know, I have very strong\nfeelings for you as well. Or you know, like there has\nto be some middle ground. You don't just pretend\nyou didn't hear them. - Yeah, I mean I guess\nall of it requires skill, just like you described. And I think just being honest\nin quotes is not enough. - Well, it's not a specific\nenough instruction. (Lex laughs) I mean, that's the problem you see, when you write a relationship book, which I never intended to do. People come to you and say, what are the things I should\ndo to help my relationship? Or what is the cause of divorce? And you go, well, disconnection, but like, what do you mean by that? Or like, how do I improve my relationship? Pay more attention. Make small gestures. Okay, what does that even mean? Like what do you mean? Acts of love. You should show your partner\nthat you love them more often. What do you mean? Like what I say, what I do? We should have more sex? Like what are you at, what are you saying? People want measurable, specific things. So that's why I tried\nin my book to be like, very specific about\nlike things you can do, things you shouldn't do. And they're practical suggestions. Like leaving a note. I talk a lot about leaving a note. If you're dating someone\nor you're living with them or you're in a serious relationship, send a text, leave a note,\njust little every day, just some little thing\nthat just tells them how much you like them. Like this is a low cost, high value move doesn't take much and it's a practical thing. But when we speak in these\nsort of like broader axioms, these broader concepts\nthat people just don't have any idea how to practically apply. - I can't wait to listen to the audiobook where you talk about\nmanaging marital finances as like anal sex, which your mastery of the metaphor (James laughs) touches one's heart and soul, your Shakespeare of the\n21st century really. - I don't know that Shakespeare\nwould've brought anal up in that context, but I appreciate it. Yeah, yeah.\n(lex laughs) My thesis there or my\npoint there was, you know, proceed carefully and have\ndiscussion in advance. - [Lex] Yes. - And don't just spring it on someone. - [Lex] Sure. - And realize that if this goes wrong, it will go catastrophically wrong. So good communication is\nimportant and, you know, yeah. I don't think it's\nsomething you should just dive into unless you're prepared for that to have potentially very negative impact. - And finances is one of the sources of a huge amount of stress\nin relationships, which is- - Tremendous. Because it's about value, I think. I mean, aside from having painful conversations about what you tried to do and were able to do, or what your impulse control was in terms of what you spent money on, like there's the conversation and then there's what's\nunderneath the conversation. There's gender stuff about men feeling the need to be a provider. There's gender stuff of men or women thinking material goods will fill the void and buying things and then\ncreating stress on their partner. There's the very human desire\nto make things seem effortless so your spouse doesn't feel any stress, when in fact it's causing\ntremendous financial stress. And then when the dam\nbreaks, it breaks hard. So yeah, there's a lot. Finances is tricky stuff. And you could probably\nbe wonderful romantic and sexual partners and\nhave very different styles of how you handle your finances and how you handle your\nfinances is informed by, not only your individual psychology, but also how you were raised and how your family\ntaught you about finance and how you should\nconduct your finances so. - And there's interesting\npower dynamics in play. - Tremendously, yeah. Those are very tricky because\nthe standard of living of a couple becomes\nimportant in a divorce, but sometimes this\ntoxic standard of living that created toxic levels of stress is one of the causes of the divorce. - [Lex] Yeah. - And they're asking the court to maintain a financial obligation on you. That is the reason why\nthe marriage fell apart. And that feels like a particularly insulting form of indignity."

      "text": "- Well, you're a fascinating\nhuman being on many levels, but you're also exceptionally productive. And you've talked to me\nabout waking up early. For you, we've met today at 11:00 AM. And for you, that's what\nlate afternoon I suppose. - [James] Yeah. - We had to negotiate\nand come to an agreement because I went to bed at 4:00 AM. - And I was up at, I get\nup at four every day. - [Lex] You woke up at four.\n- So now I'm here. Well, I woke it's three\no'clock local time. - [Lex] Yes. - So I woke up at three local time. - [Lex] Nice. - Yeah, I wake up at four naturally, then my body just wakes up.\n- [Lex] Oh wow. - And wakes up-\n- [Lex] That's fascinating. - Full on this speed.\n- [Lex] Wow. - Like my most productive writing and speaking is from 4:00\nAM until noon or one. - So can you take me through a productive, like a perfectly productive day? - I wake up at 4:00 AM very naturally. I wish I didn't, but I do check my phone first thing 'cause I wanna see if\nany emergencies came in from a client overnight. - [Lex] So work emergencies. - Yeah, work related emergencies. And it is a divorce lawyer. Our definition of emergency\ncan be very serious. It's people absconding with a child. It's a police being involved\nin a domestic violence. And so they can be like\ntime sensitive things. And when someone is\nhiring a divorce lawyer, I think they're hiring, they\nwant someone responsive. My clients have my cell phone number and I go to bed early\nbecause I get up early. And so I go to sleep by 8:00 PM latest. I don't think I've seen 9:00\nPM even on New Year's Eve. So I wake up at four, I check\nmy phone, check my email. Usually even if there's something that's, you know, time sensitive, it's usually not so time sensitive that it needs to be\nresponded to at 4:00 AM 'cause most other normal\npeople are asleep. I have espresso, black espresso,\nwhich I enjoy very much. And then I work out, and that's some days gonna be weights, a lot of days it's just gonna be cardio. I've changed my habits now\nthat I'm in my early 50s. It used to be much more\nintensive weight training and deadlifts and stuff like that. And then I herniated my L5S1. So 485 was my max deadlift. And now I don't hardly do deadlifts. - Well, you can still\nrelive the past glory? - I do. I still I have some pictures of videos. - [Lex] You have pictures.\n- I have videos. I have videos of me putting 485 for three. - But you can, in stories,\nwhen you talk about it, you can exaggerate how much\nyou've actually lifted. - That's true. But then you can't back it up. See, I'm very evidence-based. So if I don't have a photo or video of it, it's just puffing, mere puffery at that point. But I work out and then I try to work\nout for like a good hour. And I do that partly because of stress. I think when I don't\nwork out, it's difficult. I had a group of guys\nthat I would do jiu-jitsu with at 5:00 AM, they were\nmostly law enforcement. They were cops who would\neither be starting a shift or coming off of a night shift. And we would train together,\njust do like an open mat. And it was at 5:00 AM till\nsix and that was heaven. I love training jiu-jitsu first thing in the morning if I can. And then I always do either a sauna or steam for 20 minutes, half an hour. And then I do a cold plunge. Or if I don't have access to\na cold plunge, a cold shower. And then I have breakfast, and it's usually a very\nuncontroversial simple breakfast. I like to eat, you know, I eat like slow carb,\nTim Ferriss type style. And then I get right to work. I try to do my drafting early in the day. Prenups, motions, things like that from let's say six or\nseven until nine, 9:30, which is when court begins. - So drafting is like writing\nup different documents. - Right, writing prenups,\nwriting separation agreements, writing settlement proposals,\nwriting motions for the court, pretrial memos, which is like research that I wanna present to a judge\nthat supports my arguments. I do drafting. I review documents that the attorneys who work for me have\ndrafted and refine them. And then court is usually\nfrom nine o'clock until noon. And if we're on trial, then it's a whole different pace, because trials, the lunch break\nisn't really a lunch break. You're preparing the afternoon's witnesses and you're trying to do damage control on what happened in the morning. But if it's just court conferences, like most cases, there's conferences. Conferences as you go in,\nyou make oral argument, but you don't have witnesses on the stand, you're not taking testimony. It's like everybody's just\nshouting allegations back and forth and making\ntemporary arguments pretrial. It's kinda the foreplay\nof the trial, right? - Is that exhausting by the way? - It's exhausting when\nyou're done with it. Like while you're doing\nit, it's exhilarating. I always say that I never sleep as poorly as the night before a trial. And I never sleep as well as\nthe night I finished a trial. - [Lex] Yeah. - Because when I am on trial,\nI am speaking, listening, watching the judge closely to\nsee what they're reacting to and when they're paying attention\nor not paying attention, watching opposing counsel\nand the opposing party. When is the opposing party\nwriting a little note to their lawyer to show it to them? What is the opposing counsel objecting to? My client is trying to\npass me notes half the time while I'm speaking and\nmaking my arguments. I'm trying to like adjust\nwhat I'm doing strategically based on the objections\nthat the judge is ruling on. So I'm so hyperstimulated on trial that when you finish you can't even talk. You're gone. Your brain is jello.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Conferences is harder because at least with a trial there's a singularity of focus. Like with a trial, it's just one case and\nthey have all my attention. The problem is, is then\non the lunch break, all the other cases\nthat I've been ignoring for the last several hours\nwhile I was on trial, they all have stuff going on. So it's like, hey, where's that\nsettlement proposal on this, Hey this, she just did this. We need to file a motion. So now it's like, okay,\nI have an hour to eat and to answer all of this\nin some preliminary way to delegate some responsibilities. And then I gotta go back in and put a 100% on my focus\non this other case again. So you find yourself in a place. That's why I'm very disciplined, is you find yourself in a place where I live my whole life in\nsix minute increments, tenths of an hour, 'cause we\nbill in tenths of an hour. So everything I do,\nit's like 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and I'm logging time throughout the day. - [Lex] That's fascinating. - And you find yourself\nat the end of the day. My son is a lawyer, my older son. He's a district attorney\nand I'm very proud of him. He gets to put bad guys in jail and he's very smart and\nhe's doing a great job. He just about a year ago. And when he graduated from law school, we were very close and we\nwere talking and he said, we were just talking about like the career and the law that he\nwas about to embark on. And I said to him, you know, the feeling at the end of the day when like all your homework\nor all your work is done and you just go, okay, it's all done now and I'm gonna go home. You'll never have that feeling ever again, ever. You're just gonna every day go, alright, it's enough, it's enough. I gotta, I got it, I gotta get outta here. - [Lex] Yeah. - Because you could, with\nevery one of these cases, you could stay up 24\nhours focusing just on it. So you have to have the discipline to go. Yeah, no, that's it. I'm done for now. I've done what I could do today, and now I'm going to sit\nand read for a half an hour. I'm gonna watch this\nshow for a half an hour. I'm gonna have this meal because you, it's never done, you know,\nso that's challenging. That's a hard part of this job. But I think my discipline helps with that. And then I like I said, I finish my day around 5:30, six o'clock, and I have something to eat and I try to wind down a little. And I'm usually in bed by\n7:30 and asleep by eight."

      "text": "- You mentioned jiu-jitsu. You're a brown belt, what role has jiu-jitsu\nplayed in your life? - I love jiu-jitsu. I trained martial arts from\nthe time I was a little kid. I think I was seven or eight. I took up budokan and goju karate, and I did judo and it was\nalways part of my life. And then I got to college and grad school and I didn't have time for it\nand I didn't do it so much. And then I got divorced. I was quite young still\nwhen I got divorced and I had two young kids and I thought, well, I can like, you know, grow a goatee and buy a convertible and do like the thing\nyou're supposed to do when you're dude with\nkids close to middle age, or I can try to do\nsomething more productive. And so I said, well, maybe\nI'll go back to martial arts. So I took up Muay Thai, kickboxing, and they had a jiu-jitsu class at the same school after\nthe Muay Thai class. And I had been around the\norbit of jiu-jitsu having been, my kids took karate and\nthere was jiu-jitsu there, it was a Gracie Academy. And I stayed for a jiu-jitsu class and I had 120 pound girl ragdoll me, 'cause I just knew\nnothing about grappling. And I remember just going, well,\nI gotta learn what this is. And that was it. I just dove into it. My first professor was Louis\nVintaloro in New Jersey's, a Royler Gracie black belt. Great teacher, taught\nme amazing fundamentals. Took me all the way up to purple belt. And then right after I got my purple belt, I moved to the city, I moved to Manhattan. I actually chose my apartment based on its proximity to Marcelo Garcia. (Lex laughs) And I moved to West Chelsea because it was a short\nwalk to Marcelo's Academy. My core jiu-jitsu was up to purple belt. It was Louis Vintaloro. And then it's been Marcelo,\nand Marcelo, Paul Shriner, who's really phenomenal at his academy. And all of people at his academy, I mean, are are all phenomenal. I mean, Bernardo was\nthere for a period of time that I was there, and\nbefore he went to Boston, Marcos Tinoco was like\nhis lasso guard stuff. He was at Marcelo's for a long time. And what a teacher, I mean, my lack of skill at\njiu-jitsu is not based on a lack of quality instruction. (Lex laughs) It's based on an inability\nto retain the information, you know, for very long. - I mean, like for me, that's one of the most reliable place I can go to humble myself. - I love jiu-jitsu. I love the progressive humility that it drives home constantly. I love the impossibility of perfecting it. Although Gordon Ryan's probably come close and Marcello's probably\ncome close to perfecting it. - Let me ask you actually,\nsince you mentioned Gordon Ryan, (James laughs) so apparently some close with Gordon and I'm sure you know, in Austin, just this jiu-jitsu\nscene, this incredible. - It's jitsu mecca, yeah.\n- He is the mecca. - I'm actually seeing\nJohn Danaher this evening. - So he's, I mean, yeah, this is like- - [James] Yeah, this is amazing. - A truly special place. But anyway, apparently long\nago you mentioned Jersey, (James laughs) there's a bit of a conflict\nbetween you and Gordon and you mentioned to me\noffline that you love him and like just how much\nrespect you have for him as an athlete and so on. But can you explain why is this be? - Yeah, I'm actually glad I have the, it's funny that you bring it\nup and of all the, you know, we're talking about all these heavy topics and this is probably the\none that I find most, the most actually emotional. But Gordon's a very, I think\na very young man still, he's like probably in\nhis 20s or early 30s. And it's hard to imagine that 'cause he is accomplished\nso much as an athlete and as a business person. But there was a time, you\nknow, not that long ago, I think it was eight or nine years ago, where he was just a\nyoung guy on his way up. He's only, I think a couple\nyears older than my oldest son. And I, through a series of\ncircumstances, jiu-jitsu wasn't, it's really exploded in the last 10 years, but there were not as many people sponsoring quote unquote super fights. There really weren't like\njiu-jitsu super fights being sponsored Jersey\nand New York particular. And I got involved in sponsoring some jiu-jitsu super fights. And I also got involved in sponsoring some jiu-jitsu athletes. And Gordon was a young part\nof the Danaher Death Squad. I was friends with Eddie Cummings. I'm still friends with Eddie. I was friends with John,\nI'm still friends with John, but I didn't really know Gordon. I actually don't know\nthat I've still ever met. I don't think I've ever met Gordon. I've been in the same room as him. But there was a fight that, I had sponsored some other fights with this particular promoter and they asked me to sponsor one. And it didn't involve\nanyone from Marcelo's, but it involved Gordon. He was one of the people. And I liked John very much and I liked everybody in\nthe Danaher Death Squad. I like watching them compete. And I thought, you know, I\nthink John's just brilliant. I mean everyone at\nMarcelo's has such respect for John and for everyone. And the stuff they were doing, like when they were the early days of that Danaher Death Squad, like the Eddie Cummings,\nlike his leg locks. He just blew the whole game up. It just was a whole\nnother thing, you know, it was like insane what\nthey did such innovation. And Gordon at the time was he was online and I'm much older than that. I'm in my early 50s and that's not, I guess chronologically that much older, but generationally I think\nit's quite a bit different. And Gordon was smack\ntalking with a guy who I, about a guy who I was sponsor of, who I knew and who I knew\nwas a very good athlete and had been through\ndifficult things in his life. And Gordon just said some\nlike nasty things about him. It falls into the category of totally appropriate smack talking, looking at it now and looking\nat what Gordon became, which is he's someone who talks trash. It's like part of his\nbrand is to talk trash. And I see now that that's\nlike a Muhammad Ali thing, but the time I just didn't\nsee it as what it was. And although it doesn't excuse\nit, my mother was dying. I was not at my best, I\nwas having a hard time. And Gordon had spoken ill of this person and I got upset and I reached out to John and to Tom DeBlass, and I said to them, \"Hey, like, could you tell\nthis guy to knock it off? Don't talk about this person who I sponsor if I'm\nsponsoring his fight.\" I don't even know this Gordon Ryan kid and I'm sponsoring his fight\nand he should say thank you. Don't talk bad about a\nperson I financially sponsor, like that's not cool. And I think on Facebook, he like wrote some comments and then I wrote some comments back and I was incredibly obnoxious. And very soon after I felt really gross, 'cause I was an adult and I was talking to a\nyoung person this way, who's on their way up, who's like a little older\nthan one of my kids. And I just said these\nobnoxious things to him. And I felt really like,\nthat's gross, you know. But I'd never really\nthought much about it again. I watched his star rise and I was very, I mean, who's not\nimpressed by Gordon Ryan, and everyone at our\nacademy was always very like thrilled to see him rise. And I've stayed friends with John and every time Gordon\nwould have a big victory, I would always text John and be like, because Gordon's victories\nare John's victories too. They have such a great bond. All the people in his orbit like are all people\nthat I respect and like, and I just would say, \"Hey\nlisten, congratulations, and please pass all my\ncongratulations to Gordon.\" We don't know each other. I don't have his number, I have no way to contact\nhim to apologize to him. But you know, if Gordon hears this, I am profoundly sorry. I don't say that 'cause I'm trying to\nget in your good graces. I don't know that we'll\never meet each other, but that was a unbelievably wrong, stupid thing to say to a young person. - Well, thank you for saying that. This warms my heart in general. - So you talk to a divorce\nlawyer and it warms your heart. Look at that. - Well, speaking of which, you're a romantic actually,."

      "text": "You've seen love, you've seen love break down completely. What role does love play\nin the human condition? - I mean, it's kind of everything, right? Like it's love is, romantic love wars are\nfought for romantic love. Empires fall because of romantic love. Like it takes down kings. It takes down, you know, we're all just struggling for it. We're all just chasing it. Like we're all chasing the dragon. It's like the rush we all are. So it's huge. It's huge. I mean, sex and love, which I like to believe\nare in some way connected and love and romance, which again, I like to believe are\nin some way connected. I think it's huge. Look, I've always thought most\nof what men do, including me, we do to get laid, like on some level. You wanna be successful. Why? So you can have money. Why? So you can have nice things so that you can attract attractive members of the opposite sex. Like a lot of things come down to that. And even for like men, like red pilled, men, who are like, yeah,\nI don't care about women. Well, you talk about 'em an awful lot. Like for someone that's\nnot interested in women, you sure are like in the orbit of women who you're telling how much\nyou don't care about women, which kind of feels like you're doing that to attract a certain kind of woman, which I get, you know,\nlike more power to you. A person who worships an idol and a person who destroys\nan idol or both idolers. - [Lex] Yes. - If all you're talking about\nis how you don't need women, you're talking about women an awful lot. So it's just such a\nsplinter in people's mind, relationships, breakups, and like it's such a great equalizer. I mean, you're spending some time in the rarefied air now of\nlike big celebrity people. And I remember when I\nstarted out as a lawyer just doing like the regular, like the cop and the teacher with a 401k, and they didn't have any assets. I remember thinking like, well, someday if I represent celebrities or wealthy CEOs, like\nthey'll be different. They'll be like smarter. They'll be like different. It's just the same-\n- [Lex] It's the same. - Weird petty shit, the\nsame infidelity, the same. - The same kind of insecurities,\nthe same kind of jealousy, the same kind of fights. - [James] Yeah.\n- It all. - It's all the same.\n(Lex laughs) But it is, it's like it, and it's all this same\ninsecurity, sadness. It's the same like desire to be validated, like mommy issues, daddy\nissues, like intimacy issues, you know, and it's all the same stuff. And just because you're\nreally good at other things. Like I've represented\nprofessional athletes who are phenomenal world class, doctors, business people, and they suck at relationships. No better than like anybody else. There's no connection between the skills that made you a good entrepreneur and the skills that made you\na good spouse or partner. I'm sure there's some\noverlap, like patience is good and thinking strategically\nis probably good. I'm just humbled by how\nwe're called to it still like it's so, and even when we lose and even when like our greatest pains were caused by our desire to love and be loved in a romantic sense, we just keep putting the money\non the table and playing. We won't just quit. We just keep going. - [Lex] And the whole\nmess of it is worth it. - I mean, I guess, I guess so. It's calling us. I don't know if it's worth it or not. That's a value judgment, right? We don't stop. I don't know a lot of people that, that they played the hand\nthey lost and they went, well, no more of that game for me. I'm not a good poker player. I'm not playing poker anymore. I know people who've done that. I know people that are\nlike, listen, I don't drink, like, you know, I'm allergic. I break out in handcuffs\nand hospital bills. I'm not drinking anymore. But I don't know people that are like, man, that relationship, I screwed that up. Or I got screwed on that one,\nI'm not doing that anymore. You can say that. Everybody says that. I'm through with love, you know, I'm done. They're not, they keep going. They'll go up again. - Never gonna fall in love again. And then a few weeks later. - Yeah, I got job security,\nman, I got job security. People are not gonna stop\nwalking down that aisle. They are not gonna stop having kids with people that they probably\nshould have thought through, whether they would have kids\nwith that person or not. - But I'm glad they are. I'm glad they're taking that leap. I'm glad they've taken that risk. It's this whole beautiful\nmess that we're all a part of. It's like taking that risk. - [James] Yeah. - Taking that leap of vulnerabilities of what this whole thing is about. - Yeah, and what a danger\nif we didn't, you know. - [Lex] Yeah. - You hear about people\nlike Alexander Hamilton or you hear about, you\nknow, people who like, they were born of circumstances that like these two people should\nnever have had a kid and then they did. And that kid changes the world. And moves the dial forward and what a like what great mistake. What a great, you can't\never say it's a mistake. Like what an amazing thing that happened. And I think that that's one of the things I like about divorce as a practice and as almost looking at it\nlike a spiritual practice. I think you just don't\nknow what is a blessing, right, in the world. You just don't know. My father, I've spoken\nabout this before publicly, and he does frequently. My father's an alcoholic. My father's been in recovery\nnow for seven years, I think, yeah. But he was a bad alcoholic. Vietnam veteran my whole life, and only got sober, you\nknow, when I was in my 40s. And a lot of the personality\ncharacteristics I have are consistent with those of\nadult children, of alcoholics, desire for control and control issues, lot of those things. And I love my life. I'm having a great time. If I died tomorrow, man,\nI did more, learn more, earned more, loved more\nthan I ever dreamed. And so I'm so glad my\ndad was an alcoholic. And if you said to me,\nhow do you raise kids? I wouldn't say like, well, you definitely\nwanna be an alcoholic, 'cause like your kid's gonna\nget a lot of really good discipline lessons from that experience. No, like I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't want that for, but it's born, like all\nthese wonderful things were born of this awful situation. So I think divorce is the same thing. We make these mistakes, right? But they're not really, like often have to say to my clients when they're like, oh, I wish\nI'd never married this person. I'm like, you love your kids, right? Your kids are half that person. They would not be the organism they are without that person's DNA. So you can't regret being with that person if you love your kids. Like if you love your kids, those kids don't exist\nwithout that person. And I don't know how we refocus on that. I don't know, maybe we give, anyone going through a divorce, I've actually had a theory,\nwhich I've not said out loud, but I'll say it to you\n'cause it's just us talking. I think if we could figure out a way to take a divorcing couple that is interested in\npotentially mediating and put them in a setting where we could give them both psilocybin like a good dose, like 2\nand a 1/2, three grams, and have them do individual sessions with controlled setting with a guide, right? And have them sort of do that inner work and then have them do some\nkind of a session together after they've had that experience, that psychedelic experience. I actually think you could do\ntransformative divorce work because I have found myself, and certainly, the many\npeople that I've talked to who've had psilocybin\nexperiences in particular, but any psychedelic experience, many of the empathogens, right? Or even like MDMA, you know, like MDMA, which is an empathogen. If we brought that space and the divorce and conflict resolution space together, that sort of psychopharmacological\nintervention on empathy, one's empathy receptors\nor one's connectivity, I think that could be\nradically transforming. It would be logistically\nan absolute nightmare. It would never get done\nfrom a legal standpoint. But man, like I think\nsometimes like that if, because I think the more\nthat you can bring people to the awareness of connection that comes from many people's\npsychedelic experiences, I think they could then\nextrapolate that into their understanding of the conflict and disconnect they're\nhaving with their partner. - So really lean into the, like use this brink of\ndivorce as a kind of catalyst. - [James] Yeah. - For doing a lot of soul searching, a lot of growth together. - Well, that was what\nappealed to me about it. I mean, before I started doing it. Is it was this idea that\nthis is a opportunity for radical reinvention.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - It was an opportunity for people to say, okay, now what? I didn't expect that, now what? And it was to be part of\nthe architecture of that. I didn't look at it like I'm\nhelping demolish the building. It was like, I'm tearing down the building so we can build the new one, which I hope is filled with\njoy and abundance and peace and love and real love, real satisfaction. My ex-wife is married\nfor over a decade now to a phenomenal guy\nwho is perfect for her. And he is nothing like me, by the way. If you met him and you've met both of us, you'd go, well, no one could\nlove both of these guys. He's like, if you like this flavor, you wouldn't like this flavor. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like, I'm impatient, fast\ntalking, skip to the end, we gotta land this plane, come on. And he's like, he's therapist, he's chill, he's certainly patient and\nthey're perfect together. And I can say that as someone\nwho loves her and loved her, and knows her or knew her, and I think if we can, you know, if we can radically view honestly, like without jealousy, without the sense of like, look at it and just go, yeah, yeah, okay. Like this is the love this person needed. That doesn't mean my love sucks. Just means it wasn't the\nright one for this person. You know, like there's someone in, there's a lid for every pot. Like she found her lid. I want her to find her lid. That's good. - And there's billions of pots out there and we just need to match\n'em with the proper lid. - Yeah, and not hit\neach other over the head with 'em all day long. - Yeah, man, this is\nsuch a romantic few hours we've got to spend together, and there's even a candle\nburning over there. - Is there? Oh, that's lovely. - All right, brother,\nthanks so much, James. - Thank you. Thanks for having me. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with James Sexton. To support this podcast, Please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you\nwith some words from Rumi. \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and\nfind all the barriers within yourself that you\nhave built against it.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."

  "full_text": "- We have been encouraged\nculturally to criticize people we're in long-term\nrelationships with, not new relationships. New relationships, you put\nthe person on a pedestal, you're allowed to just,\noh, they're wonderful. But every trope out there in\nevery form of popular media is like the wife rolling\nher eyes at the husband and the husband being like, oh, there's loathsome\nheartbeat that castrated me. As if like, people are just\npassive players in their lives. And I think that is an\nincredibly toxic message to send to people.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - That this is how we should\nbe relating to our partner. Like we should not, you don't take the piss outta your partner in front of people.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Like the successful\nrelationships I've seen are where people are just\ncheering for their partner where they're thick as thieves, where there is just this feeling of like, man, they like each other. They got each other's back\nlike you wouldn't believe. Man, you could take sides against anybody, but take sides against their partner. You're going down, and that when you see\na couple that has that, that's so hard to break. But I think that comes from\nhaving like a steadfast. Yeah, no, I don't do that.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I don't talk my partner.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And you don't shit\ntalk my partner to me. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And that to me is when, because I think we're just\nso criticized by the world. The world is so full of criticism. We criticize ourselves so harshly, that having a partner who\nno matter what is like, you've got this, I'm with you. Okay, yeah, you screwed up, I see it. Look, I'm not gonna lie to\nyou about your blind spots. You screwed up, but you know what? People screw up sometimes. You got a right to screw up. A lot of people screw up. Come on, get up. Let's go. I know you have it in you. If you have that person like that. I feel like that's a superpower. - The following is a\nconversation with James Sexton, divorce attorney and author\nof \"How to Stay in Love A Divorce Lawyer's Guide\nto Staying Together\" As a trial lawyer, James, for over two decades has negotiated and litigated a huge number\nof high conflict divorces. This has given him a deep understanding of how relationships fail\nand how they can succeed. And bigger than that, the role of love and pain in this whole messy\nrollercoaster ride we call life. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's James Sexton. What is the most common\nreason that marriages fail? - That's a great question, but it's a question that everybody wants there\nto be a simple answer. Like they want me to say cheating\nor money or the internet. But the reality is, I think it's a lot of little things. It's disconnection. That would be my answer. The reason marriages\nfail is disconnection. What causes disconnection? That's the bigger, and I think more important question because like Tom Wolf\nsaid about bankruptcy, \"It happens very slowly\nand then all at once.\" Disconnection happens very\nslowly and then all at once. So most of the time, what I think people want\nis an answer like cheating. But cheating is the big all at once thing. How did we get to the place where cheating was even something you\nwere thinking about doing, or that you would think about and then cross the line\nfrom thought into action? And that's I think the big question. So disconnection would be my answer. - Do you think it's possible to introspect like looking backwards\nfor every individual case where the disconnection\nbegan and how it evolved? - [James] Sure, yeah, this is\nsuch a multi-variate equation. It's a dance. It's a chemistry. It's what did you do and\nwhat did the other person do? And see, the interesting thing about\nbeing a divorce lawyer is I'm weaponizing intimacy in a courtroom. I'm telling it's full context storytelling what I do for a living. So what I do is I take my client's story and I have to present it to a judge and make my client the hero in\nevery way and the other side, the villain in every way. Now I have to be careful not to do that in a manner that loses credibility. Because even a judge would know, even a judge is smart enough to know that no one's all good or all bad, but only if you were reverse\nengineering a relationship and saying, how did this break? You really have to look at both people, the good and the bad. What each of them did that moved the dial in\nthese different directions. And I think that that's very hard for anyone\ngoing through a divorce to do about their own relationship. We don't know who discovered\nwater, but it wasn't a fish. Like if you're in it, I don't\nthink you see it clearly. I think as a divorce\nlawyer whose job is to really drill down on the facts and figure out what's\ngoing on in this story, I have to look at both sides. So I have to think a lot\nabout my own arguments, but I also have to think about what's the other lawyer's\nargument going to be, especially in custody cases. So I really have been\nforced to look at both sides for so many years, so\ndeeply in relationships. That once you do that, you realize that the\ngood guy, bad guy thing just doesn't apply. - I wonder if it's the little things or a few big things that\ncause this connection, whether it's, I mean, you've talked about granola and blowjobs, but those seem to be stories that you can tell to yourself like, maybe that story should be explained. Or maybe not. - You don't think granola and\nblowjobs is self-explanatory. - Almost. I think people can construct a good, like if you ask GPT what do they mean? I think the story that would\ncome up is a pretty good one. But that's a story you tell\nabout when you first knew it's the disconnection has begun, is when you stop buying\nmy favorite granola, or when she stopped giving blowjobs. - I would say when it's\nreached like a critical mass. - Yeah, face shift of some sort. - 'Cause I think it started before that. When she said, yeah, I\nused to give him blowjobs and when we were in\nour early relationship, and then one day like, I just was like, oh, well, we don't have as much time. Well, I'll wait until\nlater and we'll have sex and then we both enjoy it. - Blowjobs are inefficient. - Yeah, exactly correct. - So you batch it all together. - Yeah, so she said, well, exactly. And they had kids at that point, so I think she really was like, hey, we've got a certain window. - Yeah. - So let's have something we both enjoy. So I don't think she had any\nnegative intentions there. I think that she was working in good faith towards the betterment\nof the relationship, but it was having this\nsecond order effect. And so I really do think that, yeah, the blowjobs, the granola, I mean, there anyone who's been\nin a long-term relationship, I guess it's just worth\nasking the question, what does this person do\nthat makes me feel loved? Because I think it's very interesting in my own experience in life. Remember, I had a difficult\nchapter with one of my sons, my younger son when he\nwas in his early 20s, and we were having a\nheartfelt conversation. And I said to him, \"Do\nyou know I love you?\" And he said, \"Well, yeah, of course I do.\" I said, \"But do you feel my love? Like, do you feel it?\" You know, not just do you\nknow it intellectually? Do you feel it? And I remember thinking to myself, when do we feel someone's love, right? Like what is it that they do? And sometimes it's the weirdest, silliest things that\nthey would never know. They, the person who's\nshowing us that they love us and that we're feeling their love. They would never show us, if you said, \"Why does\nthis person love you?\" They wouldn't say, Oh, 'cause I always make sure\nthat when the paper comes, I bring it from the bottom\nof the driveway to the door so they don't have to go out and get it. Or I always hold the door for them. Or I, you know, oh, I always like, again, I buy the granola that I\nknow this person likes. Or I remembered that they don't like it when I put on this particular\nrecord, so I don't put it on. And those are these, yes,\nthey're small things, but they're not small. They're kind of everything. - Do you think it's good\nto communicate that stuff? - Well, a 100%. - It takes away some of\nthe power of it, right? - When you point it out,\nthen the person realizes, oh, okay, he likes this or dislikes this. So yes, there becomes a\ndeliberateness to it, a conscious. So I understand not pointing that out when it's a good thing. I think when it's a negative thing. Like I think in the granola situation, if she had said to him, \"Hey, you used to do\nthis and you've stopped. That feels like something to me.\" Like she said, she didn't\nsay anything about that, just like he probably didn't say anything about the blowjobs. I think if there had been a\nmoment of this is starting, let's talk about it while it's starting. But people wait from what I can see. - [Lex] Yeah. - People wait until the big thing happens. The financial impropriety,\nthe substance use disorder, the cheating. They wait for that to happen and then they go, where did we go wrong? And the answer is quite a while ago, with the granola. - Yeah. Yeah, so when you notice something like you notice that little something, talk about it, 'cause that little something is probably a colonel of a deeper truth. Of course, there is also moods, we're all like a rollercoaster of emotion. So you can not bring a\ngranola one day just to, just because you're in this place where just nothing is-\n- [James] Yeah, yeah. - Just cynicism everywhere,\njust anger and so on. But it's a temporary feeling. But maybe that temporary\nfeeling is grounded in some other deeper current\nthat's actually building up. - Yeah. And I think a good partner\nwants to understand the currents - [Lex] Yeah. - Of their partner, that\nthey wanna understand. \"Hey, are you going through something?\" And look, if I'm the one\nyou need to take it out on, that's okay. I'm a big boy, I can take it. If you're hormonal, if\nyou're frustrated at work, if you're whatever. We should be able to have a little bit of that\ninteraction in a relationship. But I do think it's so\neasy to just say to people, well, communication is the key. But it really is about fearless\nkinds of communication. It's about really, honestly\nsaying to somebody, this feels like something to me. Am I wrong? This just feels like something to me. And also how that's presented. I mean, one of the things\nI'm very caught up on, or feel very strongly about is that we have been encouraged\nculturally to criticize people we're in long-term relationships with. Not new relationships. New relationships, you put\nthe person on a pedestal, you're allowed to just,\noh, they're wonderful. But every trope out there in\nevery form of popular media is like the wife rolling\nher eyes at the husband and the husband being like, oh, there's loathsome heartbeat\nthat castrated me. As if like, people are just\npassive players in their lives. And I think that is an\nincredibly toxic message to send to people. That this is how we should\nbe relating to our partner. You don't take the outta your\npartner in front of people. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like the successful\nrelationships I've seen are where people are just\ncheering for their partner where they are thick as thieves, where there is just this feeling of like, man, they like each other. They got each other's back\nlike you wouldn't believe. Man, you could take sides against anybody, but take sides against their partner. You're going down. And that when you see\na couple that has that, that's so hard to break. But I think that comes from\nhaving like a steadfast. Yeah, no, I don't do that.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I don't shit talk my partner. - [Lex] Yeah. - And you don't talk my partner to me. - [Lex] Yeah. - And that to me is when, because I think we're just\nso criticized by the world. The world is so full of criticism. We criticize ourselves so\nharshly that having a partner who no matter what is like\nyou've got this, I'm with you. Okay, yeah, you screwed up. I see it. Look, I'm not gonna lie to\nyou about your blind spots. You screwed up, but you know what? People screw up sometimes. You got a right to screw up. A lot of people screw up. Come on, get up. Let's go. I know you have it in you. If you have that person like that. I feel like that's a superpower to have that effect on another person. - Yeah, one of the things I love seeing, you look at a couple and one is talking like in an interview. - [James] Yeah. - Answering a question, especially like intellectual questions. What do you think about the\nwar in Ukraine or something? And then the partner is talking and the other person is looking at them as if they're hearing the wisest thing- - [James] Yeah.\n- Ever. - [Lex] Yeah. - They're still looking at them, not waiting for their turn to speak, not thinking about how's the\naudience going to take that? - [James] Yeah. - But they're looking at\nthem like, God, I'm so lucky. - [James] Yeah. - To be with this smart motherfucker. - Is it not? But there's this scene- - And they could be seen\nthe dumbest shit out there. (laughs) - There's a scene in the\nmovie \"True Romance.\" - [Lex] Yes, I love \"True Romance.\" - I love a great movie.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I mean, Gary Oldman scene is like the greatest scene ever done\nin film with Christian Slater. But there's a scene in it\nwhere she holds up a sign to Christian Slater and\nit says, \"You're so cool.\" - [Lex] You're so cool. - And like, man, that's it.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - That's it.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I've always, I think I say\nit somewhere in the book that, you go to weddings and\nwhen the bride walks in, everybody's looking at the bride. It's her show. Everybody turns around\nas the first glimpse everybody gets at the bride. And I never look at the bride, I always look at the groom\nlooking at the bride, because there's this\nlike, to me, that's every, like he has this look like this 'cause this is the first time he's seeing her in the\ndress most of the time. And also he's seeing her like, \"Holy shit, she's coming down the aisle. We're getting married.\" But this is it. And everyone's looking at\nher and I always look at him, 'cause I always think to myself like, the look on his face is like, that's like this feeling of\nlike, holy, yeah, wow, okay. Everyone's looking at her and she's mine and she's coming up here\nand we're getting married. And I feel like yeah, like that kind of adoration, I think that's the look we're\ndescribing is adoration, like that the words\ncoming outta their mouth that they're like, yeah, that's mine. That one's mine, you know. That's such a great thing. It's such a great feeling. - I've seen the good stuff\nlike with \"True Romance.\" I mean, you could make fun of the guys totally cringe wearing Elvis. - [James] Yeah. - Essentially being a\nfake Elvis with shades and like what is he doing? It's watching these kung fu movies. But from her perspective\nand from any perspective you could take on him is this\nis the baddest motherfucker who's ever lived. - [James] Yeah. - Like, he's willing to\ndo those things for me, but not like, it's almost\nlike an epic heroic figure. - [James] Yeah. - And we're living in\nthis epic hero story. - What does that do to him though? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- See, that's the point. If there's a point to this, to this whole thing-\n- [Lex] Yeah. this whole couple thing.\n- [Lex] Yeah. (laughs) - Isn't that it? - [Lex] Yeah. - I don't understand this idea of, we had a successful marriage. We were married for 50 something years. We were miserable for 47 of\nthem, but we hung in there. This is an endurance event. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like the primary\nrelationship of your life, you've decided you're gonna turn into the like a 50 mile trail race. Why? Why would you do that? Congratulations, you took\nthe concept of monogamy and made it something that two people are absolutely not gonna enjoy. But you hung in there. Congratulations. And I understand. There's religious perspectives that say, well, it's a sacred covenant, but I have a real chicken or\nthe egg problem with that. - [Lex] Yeah. - Because I think it was like, well, how do we sell this\nincredibly stupid concept that isn't working to people? I know, we'll tell 'em,\nGod says, you have to, and we'll sign on for that. I don't buy it. I don't buy it anymore. I really, 'cause when you see a successful marriage where you see two, even\nwithout a marriage, you see a pair bond. You see a couple that\nreally love each other and cheer for each other in that way. And hang on each other's words that way and like are just in each\nother's corner that way. You see the fake shit instantly. - [Lex] Yeah. - You see the difference right away. It's like, if you, you know, the first time I've, this is the first time\nI've come to Austin. I've thought I'd eaten a\nlot of barbecue in my life. I've never had Texas barbecue. - [Lex] Yeah. - I landed, I went and had barbecue. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - I was like, okay, I've\nnever had barbecue before. Apparently this is a\nwhole different thing. - [Lex] Yeah. - I think it's the same thing. I think it's like once you see real love, real love and I mean romantic love, like real love like that, real bond, real, you go, oh yeah, this other thing's not gonna do it. - Do you think that's a\ndaily deliberate choice that a couple like that makes? Because it feels like a very\neasy to do deliberate step. Choose to see the brilliant\nin it, the beautiful in it, and almost immediately everything shifts and it becomes this momentum where all you see is the beautiful, and all you see is the brilliant. - That is a conscious choice. I think approaching life that\nway is a conscious choice. Approaching any relationship\nthat way is a conscious choice. I mean, looking at someone who hurts you or does something hurtful to you, and thinking about what's\ngoing on in their life, that they're doing that or\nwhat's happening with them. Yeah, that's a very conscious choice. And I think a a better one. - [Lex] Yeah. - A better one than seething in animosity and letting that eat you alive. But I don't know that it's, I don't think it should be so difficult, like with our children, with our pets, we don't have this problem. You never have someone look at their dog who they've had for eight years and go, I gotta get a new dog. I've had this one for eight years. I gotta get, like puppies are so cute. What am I doing with this old dog? It's the total opposite. They're like, oh my God, this is like my dog. This is my dog. The smell of the dog is\nlike this is my dog smell. The bad habits of the dog. You're like, that's my stupid dog- - [Lex] Yeah. - That does stupid things. And it's not like that\nhas to be a conscious, they wake up every day and go, I should be grateful for the dog. Like it's just visceral. It's in them.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And your children\nlike people's children, it's why people are like not aware of how annoying their children are, because they're not annoying to them. I get it. To you, the sound of your\nkids shrieking is like, oh, my kid's having a good time. And you don't get, and see, when I try to, when I hear that, I try to\nhear it with those ears. Like, oh, that, I'm a parent, I get it. My kids are adults now. But like I get it. So when I hear a kid\nshrieking, I just am like, ah, to that parent, that's the sound of that kid\nhaving a great time and good. It's so nice that that's in the world. So for me, it has to be conscious. For that parent, I don't\nthink it has to be conscious. So I think it would be great\nif it didn't have to be a conscious practice,\nbut I wonder if like, anything in meditation or mindfulness, it's a matter of exercising\nthat way of seeing. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then once you've come to that- - [Lex] It becomes easier.\n- It does itself, right? It really does. I think initially has to\nbe a conscious practice. And by the way, it's easier to\nmake it a conscious practice before it started to fade, right? I mean, that's what's so\namazing about marriage is there's like almost eight\nbillion people in the world, and you're picking this one. So when you marry in theory, like the stock's at its highest, you're as crazy about each\nother as you could possibly be. So that's the time to get\ninto this mindfulness, to get into this practice. Not once it's like the wheels\nare starting to come off. It's much harder. It's like gaining a bunch\nof weight and then saying, \"Okay, how am I gonna\nlose the weight now?\" - Well, I think that even before\nmarriage, like right away, you just see everything is beautiful. Let me quote BoJack Horseman on this. \"When you look at someone\nthrough rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags.\" - [James] That's great. - And there's a certain sense where if you from the very beginning, of course, you could end up in toxic\nrelationships that way. - [James] Sure. - But life is short. You're gonna die eventually, might as well really go\nall in on relationships. - There's a line in \"Drugstore Cowboy,\" which is a great film. Where he says, \"We played a game you\ncouldn't win to the utmost.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - And I think everything, I think life is a game you can't win. And so you play it to the utmost. To love anything is insane because you are accepting\nthat you're going to lose it. I'm a dog person. You get a dog and you've just resigned\nyourself to unbelievable pain because this thing's gonna\ndie in like 10 years, maybe 15 if you're lucky. And why would you open your heart to that? Why would you let, because the joy is just\nso wonderful of it, of the ride up until it. Same thing with us. I mean, every marriage,\nevery relationship, every love is gonna end. It's gonna end in death or divorce. So why not like, just go in, like go in, like go\nin, and just get weird. Don't define it the way that's, I mean, look at, you know, again, we keep going back to \"True\nRomance,\" but just get weird. Like, yeah, I love this Elvis\npretending to be weirdo. I love this former sex\nworker who's like whatever. Just go in. Love this person, have 'em love you. Don't worry about what\neverybody else is doing in their relationship. We're in such, I mean, it's not to me surprising that, that as the performative aspects of life on social media increases. People's satisfaction\nwith their relationships and the divorce rate is\nfollowing the same trend. Because I think everyone's going, well, what's everybody else doing? Well, how much sex is\neveryone else having? The only two people\nthat should worry about how much sex you're having? The two people. If the two people are\nhappy in the relationship. Great, then what does it matter? What does it matter what\neverybody else is doing? - Yeah, there should be an\nelement to great relationships and great friendships\nof like fuck the world. - [James] Yeah.\n- It's us versus the world. - Us, it's us.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And that's what I mean when\nI say that thickest thieves. When they're like a unit like that, 'cause it's, look, it's just us. It's just what we want. It's what we like. And that's why I said like, even when it comes to\nsex or things like that, if you can't be candid with your partner about whatever weird shit you're into or what fantasy you had in any particular. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well then who the hell\ncan you be candid with? I mean, because you're\ngonna either go without or go elsewhere, and neither of those is a\nparticularly healthy option or helpful option. It's the start of that decline. So why? Why open yourself to that decline, which invariably is just the path to the chair in front of me in my office? - Yeah, you have a full section in\nyour book on foot fetishes. - I do.\n(Lex laughs) I do, yeah. Which is funny because I\ndon't know anything about foot fetishes.\n- Me neither. Me neither.\n- Yeah. I'm not king shaming anybody, but there's nothing sexual\nabout feet to me at all. I just don't get it, I don't, but I mean, listen, people\nlike things, it's good. But yeah, I have had clients\nthat have odd fetishes or sexual proclivities\nor things they wanna do, and they don't share it\nwith their partner at all. And then they find an outlet for it because they try to go without\nit and that doesn't work. So they try to find some\nother outlet for it. And then that's interpreted as a betrayal and it creates distance\nand people split up. And of course, everybody\nlikes to have like, you know, a bad guy to blame it on. So when you say, well,\nwhy'd you guys get divorced? Oh, 'cause he secretly had a foot fetish and he was on these message boards- - [Lex] Right.\n- Meet people but. Well, it gives you an easy answer as to why the two of you split up. But I don't think, you know, most divorces have such simple answers as it was a foot thing. But I also think too, like, listen, if you got a partner, I mean, we all do stuff\nthat we're not super into because we're in a relationship. And that's what part of it is. Do you really wanna go\nsee that chick flick? Do you really wanna\neat at this restaurant? Do you really wanna go\nto her cousin's wedding? No, but you know, part of\nbeing in a relationship is, okay, if you're into this, I'm gonna pretend this song's a good song. Even though it's not my favorite song. And I think I just don't know, we've turned sex, I mean, sex has been so\npoliticized in recent years, maybe it always was. But I think we've made it into something where we can't just, I don't know. I'm not in defeat, but if the woman I love was like, I'm really in defeat, I really wanna do stuff with your feet, I'd be like, all right, I can\npretend that I'm into that. It's not gonna kill me.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I'm not gonna be able to make it a centerpiece of our coupling. But like, yeah, I can pretend\nI'm in the feet, if you want. - I don't personally have any fetishes that are outside of the normal discourse. - As a divorce lawyer, I get to experience the whole spectrum. - But if I, like if I was\ninto furries, for example, - [James] Yeah. - I don't know how I would\ninitiate the conversation with my partner about that. - But frame the question\nthe other direction. - [Lex] Yeah. - If you were into furries. - [Lex] Yeah. - How do you prevent your partner from knowing anything about that? That feels like a real, you'd have to make a conscious choice to not let your partner know. - [Lex] Sure, sure. - I don't think either of those\nis a particularly palatable or easy proposition. - But a lot of people live life hiding some part of themselves. - Yeah, quite unsuccessfully. The second order effects of\nthat are very rarely positive. - [Lex] Sure. - I don't think I've ever\nmet someone and went, yeah, I really hid this huge part of myself for an extended period of time. - And it worked out great. - And that's the best thing that happened. It's I'm really glad, I'm really glad I stayed in\nthe closet as long as I did. It really worked out. Like it rarely does. It's a question of how\nlong can you hold it off? - [Lex] Yeah. - I know gay men who stayed\nin the closet for 40 years, 50 years of their lives, and then they had a successful\nsecond chapter as a gay man. I've had clients like that. Do they regret that\nthey were in the closet? No, because they were married. They had kids, like they had experiences\nthey're glad they had. But would their advice to\na young person in their 20s and 30s who's gay, stay in the closet, 'cause then you can have\na wife and some kids, and then you can come\nout when you're 50 or 60 and have a second chapter, no. - [Lex] Yeah. - They would say, \"Be who you are. Don't be afraid.\" - As you were talking,\nI'm trying to think of, 'cause I'm publicly and privately\nI'm the exact same person or try to be the exact same person. So I usually try to make\nsure there's nothing to hide. But I was trying to come up\nwith a counter example fee for if there's good things to, well, I mean, there could\nbe like past relationships. - [James] Oh yeah. - If I slept with thousands of women or something like this, maybe you wanna put that to the\nside when you have the guts. - Well, you don't wanna be in, there's a difference between\nbeing honest about something and being indelicate about it. - [Lex] Right. - I think we all do this with lovers. Like any of us who've been in\nmore than one relationship, you would not at the end of sex be like, that was the third best sex\nI've ever had, you know. It's just indelicate, it's rude. So I don't think it's a matter\nof total candor at all times, but I think if you were\nusing the furry example, and I'm not picking on furries. I just think if that is a proclivity that is anything other\nthan a passing thought, like it's something that you\njust keep coming back to, then you're making a conscious decision to withhold it from your partner. And what is that out of? I mean, I would say it's\nprobably out of fear. I'm not a psychologist,\nbut probably out of fear. Fear that they would reject you. That they, okay, well now\nsee, I genuinely believe that, I'm very conflicted in my religious faith, but I don't know that\nI believe in the devil, but if there was a devil, I think his principle function\nwould be to convince us that we are so Beast Jill,\nthat God couldn't love us. It would be to convince\nus that we're awful and that we should just\nlean into the awfulness. And I know the greatest low points of my life came whenever I just went, you know what? I'm just awful, I might as well just behave awfully. And I really believe that when you push down parts of yourself like your sexuality, like your insecurities, your true feelings from\nyour romantic partner, the person who's supposed\nto be you're number one, you are making sure you\nwill never feel their love because they don't love you. They love the you you've\npresented to them, which you know in your\nheart is not the authentic, honest, real you. And so if you know\nyou're super into furries and you don't tell your\npartner about that, and your partner says, I love you so much, and you know what I love, one of the things I love about us is we have such great sexual chemistry. You'll never feel that\nlove because you know, yeah, that's not true though. She doesn't know. She doesn't know that actually\nI'm not really satisfied and there is this thing that I want, that I know I can't even tell\nher 'cause I'm so ashamed of, like that doesn't feel\nlike a good option to me. - Yeah. Yeah. So that kind of vulnerability\nis essential to intimacy. - I'm prone to jiu-jitsu metaphors, and this is one of the first conversations where I can actually use them because the person I'm talking\nto is a jiu-jitsu person. But- - And people should know that you are a quote unquote \"jiu-jitsu person.\" You have been afflicted with the disease. - I am a brown belt under Marcelo Garcia, and I am like a seven\nyear brown belt now so. - Which is the right\nway to be a brown belt. - Well, and also I am, you know, late middle aged, middleweight,\nand moderately talented. And training at that academy with so many incredibly talented people and training in New York City where there's so many\nunbelievably talented people. You're constantly humble and\nfeeling like you should just be wearing a blue belt all the time. But a lot of, I think as you know, and as most people who\npractice jiu-jitsu know, you start to sort of see\njiu-jitsu in everything. I genuinely believe that in love, you have to give something\nto get something. Everything you do creates a vulnerability. Every move you make in\njiu-jitsu creates opportunity and creates vulnerability. And so you have to be willing\nto create vulnerabilities in order to get any leverage, in order to get any progress and any way to move the position. You don't want a marriage\nthat's just two people both in 50-50, like you just sitting in\nthat guard doing nothing. You want it to actually move along. - Yeah, I mean, that's the way I see love in relationships is you should take that\nleap of vulnerability, give the other person the\noption to destroy you. - Well, you have to expose, and that's the part that I\nthink is hard for everyone is to expose yourself in that way. But that's what I mean, even when I said about getting\na dog or having a child, like loving anything is\ntremendously courageous because it's terrifying. And it's only brave if you're scared. If you're not scared, it's not brave, it's just stupidity. It's bravery when you're afraid\nand you do the thing anyway. And so love is like, yeah, it's scary. I don't care who you are. In the jiu-jitsu community like I'm around as you are all like\nincredibly tough people, physically tough people,\nmentally tough people. But I've seen some of\nthose people taken down. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- By 120 pound woman. (Lex laughs) Not from a grappling perspective, but they are taken apart.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - By a woman in their life. And vice versa, I've seen\nmen, you know, who like, it really is shocking how much leverage we give to our romantic partners and how little discussion we really, genuine discussion we\nreally have about it. How much we really are ever\ntrained to think about it. There's nothing in school\nthat teaches us about it. So much of literature and art\nis an idealized version of it. So little of it is real. - And no matter how it evolves, when it ends in tragedy or drama, I feel like what people don't do enough is appreciate the good times. Appreciate how beautiful it\nis to having taken the risk and to having experienced\nthat kind of love. I think when you look at people that are divorcing each other, there's a Edgar Allan Poe quote, \"The years of love have been forgot, in the hatred of a minute.\" I always kinda am saddened, like deeply saddened how\npeople seem to forget how many beautiful\nmoments have been shared when some reason, some drama, some breakup leads them to part ways. - Yeah, yeah. It's interesting that you came to that not being a divorce lawyer, because I've felt that\nway for a long time. And I really try to say to my clients, like in the courtroom at\nthe negotiating table, I have a role to play where I have to be sort of like a pit bull or some kind of a like\na courtroom sociopath, but behind closed doors,\nI'm very candid with people. I'm try to be much more\nemotionally attuned with them. - So you're an empath in the sheets and sociopath in the streets. - Exactly correct. That's well said. I've been, boy, I got a new tattoo idea. That's good. I like that. I do believe when I'm behind\nclosed doors with people, I say to them, \"How you\nend things is gonna be how you're gonna remember\nthe whole thing.\" And that's unfortunate because you watch like a two hour movie and if the last 15 minutes of it sucked, you go, well that movie sucked. Well, the first hour in 45 was great, but you walk out with this\nbad taste in your mouth. I'm genuinely in awe of\nhow easily people forget that they loved each other. And I'm amazed because\nby the time I meet them and by the time they\nhire me to be a weapon against the person they were in love with, there's nothing but animosity there. And so I have to try to imagine what these two people looked like when they were in love with each other, and how that even existed. But I have to tell you, I don't function that way. Every woman I ever had\na relationship with, when I think of them, I don't think of the ending necessarily. I think of, I try to think\nabout the greatest hits. I try to think about the\nmoments that were wonderful, where I loved them and they loved me. And like there was joy\nand there was connection. And I don't know why you choose not to. There's that old axiom,\nI don't know who said it, that if you don't learn\nto find joy in the snow, you'll have less joy in your life and precisely the same amount of snow. - Yeah. - And I genuinely believe like, okay, the relationship ends. This is where it ends, we're done now. I am making a choice as to\nhow I will remember you. And we do it in relationships. I always tell people, if you ever wanna see a couple light up, if they're ever like the\ncouple at the table that's, you know, it seems like they\ngot in a fight or something, ask 'em how they met. And most people when they\ntalk about how they met, like their face softens, they both, and the other person looking\nat them telling the story gets that look you were\ntalking about before. And 'cause they remember that thing and how they felt at that moment. And when this person was a choice, not a default, not their\nautomatic plus one, but the person they asked to the wedding, not the, of course, you're\nbringing her, it's your wife, you bring your wife places. Like it was still, hey, there's like, 3 and a 1/2 billion women and\nI'm picking you, you know. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like that feeling. And I don't know why\nwhen a relationship ends, you can't do that. A lesson I learned when\nmy mother passed away, she had a two year\nterrible battle with cancer and was on hospice and\nwas very, very sick. And it was a very slow and awful end. And I remember one of\nmy worst fears was that this is how I would remember my mother for the rest of my life. That I would never be\nable to think of her. That I didn't think of what she had become in the last months where she was withered away\nto nothing in this bed. And I learned over time that\nmemory is very kind that like, that faded somehow. And that now when I remember her, I remember her healthy and vibrant. I remember her laughter. I remember positive things. Some of that is, I like to\nlook at photos of that or, but some of it is just\nhow I think memory works. And I don't know why we don't\napply that to relationships. And I think part of it is\nbecause we have this binary view of relationships that it's either success, which means you live happily ever after for the rest of your\nlives and die together. Or in short succession. Or it was wrong, it was awful. And I don't understand why that would have to be how we do it. I think we could look at\nrelationships like what they are, which is chapters in a book. And that book is our life. And those chapters all have significance. And none of them would,\nthe later chapters, none of them would happen\nwithout the prior ones. So there's this beauty to me of that. And I don't know if that it's a choice or if that is how it is and\nthe rest is just narrative that we've put on top of it\nculturally for some reason. - Well, I think to push back a little bit, I think memory can also, I\nthink it is a deliberate choice, 'cause I think memory can, basically, that's how trauma works. It can surface the negative stuff and the negative stuff\ncompletely drowns out all the positives. I think it's a deliberate choice to make your memory\nprobably work that way. In relationships, betrayal\ncan do that, right? Sort of cheating, infidelity, like one event can almost erase the entirety of your\nunderstanding of the past. And all the memories are sort of shrouded in this darkness of, okay, what I believed was\ntrue, is totally untrue. And sort of to overcome that and still appreciate\nthe beautiful moments. - I'm continually astounded\nby how long the hurt and anger of betrayal can reverberate. I have clients who were four years, five years past when the divorce ended, the cheating was discovered and they're as angry as they\nwere the day they found out. And I don't know what that's about. - [Lex] Yeah. - Because I also have clients\nthat they like look back on it and they go, we screwed up. We didn't do the best, but we did the best we\ncould do at the time. There should be stars for wars like ours. (Lex laughs) There should be champagne\nfor the survivors. - [Lex] Yeah, that's beautiful. - We made it through. We survived it and we were fools. And we were fools for love. And there are worse things\nin the world to be fools for. But I also do think\nthat most relationships where there was infidelity and it's not a popular thing to say, and I'll get pilloried for it, but- - [Lex] Great. - I just don't know, and I don't wanna blame\nthe victim of infidelity, but was the relationship\nreally where it needed to be? Were you truly the most\njust dutiful spouse who was seeing this person's needs be met? Again, we've established\nin the granola story that people can sometimes\nwith good intentions not be meeting their partner's needs or perceiving their partner's needs. Or their partner isn't\ncommunicating them the right way or all of the above. But I've rarely seen very\nhappy content couples that cheat on each other. And so I understand\nthere's a shame in saying, this person cheated on me, or I cheated on this person, 'cause I represent the cheater\nand I represent the cheated, I represent the victim\nof domestic violence and I represent the perpetrator\nof domestic violence. I represent the person with\na substance use disorder, the person married to the person. So I don't get to choose\nthe white or the black hat. Like I have my client\nand that's my client. And it's forces me to put\nmyself into their story, from their point of view. And I think that kind of radical empathy that you need to engage\nin on a daily basis to represent people in\nthose kinds of proceedings, it just I don't know, it just doesn't seem like\nthere's good guys and bad guys. It just seems like it's\ncomplicated and people's intentions and where they actually\nend up are different. - Yeah, I think there's some sense in still remembering the betrayal as it being symptom of taking\nlife a little too seriously. Too seriously where you don't, life shouldn't be taken that seriously. You should be able to laugh at it all. I like the story you say of being able to appreciate the battle that should give stars for those\nkind of wars that we fought and just kind of be\nable to laugh at it all. - Especially with love.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Like, that's just so absurd. - [Lex] Yeah. Like, it's so-\n- It's just crazy. - It's so crazy. I mean, like, I don't, you know what? I think it's funny I\nthink this is real candor, but as a man, there's nothing funnier than\nwhen you finish masturbating. There's no more humbling moment. And I like to think about the\nfact that like the richest, famous, most powerful person\nin the world, they jerkoff. The most powerful man in the\nworld jerksoff, I'm sure. All of them do. I mean, you probably probably\nknow them so you could ask, and that moment where you\njust, you come and you go, what am I doing? Like what the, now I gotta\nwipe the like, oh, good Lord. And there's this feeling of, but a second ago this\nseemed like a great idea and it was by the way,\nit was a great idea. There's this moment, this satori, where you just go, oh, like what? This is so silly. Well, that's love, that's sex. When you read other people's infidelity, the text messages, the emails, 'cause I have to do that all the time. And I'll tell you how we make the sausage. In a divorce lawyer's office, some of the most entertaining moments is dramatic readings aloud\nof people's infidelity exchanges with their lovers. - [Lex] The sexts. - Yeah, the sext and like, you know, it's just so ridiculous, 'cause people have to go through like all kinds of gymnastics to be able to meet and have sex in weird places.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And you're reading this and\nyou're reading these texts and you kind of go like,\noh my God, these people. And by the way, I've represented\nsome very powerful people and you read their texts with their lover or even their spouse,\nlike even their spouse, and they're just pathetic. I mean, they're just like so not powerful. They're so like, \"Hey babe.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - I have a name totally nameless- - [Lex] Yeah. - I have a very powerful,\nwealthy, famous former client where there's a whole\nseries of texts about, is my dick weird? Which by the way, I think the answer is, is if you have to ask if\nyou have a weird dick, the answer's probably yes, 'cause I've owned one and I've\nnever thought is this weird? The fact that you're\nhaving this discussion. It's absurd. It's hilarious. Love is hilarious. It's bizarre. It's such a weird vulnerability. It's such a basic visceral human need. It really is something that we just, it's mysterious. It doesn't have to be that complicated. I don't think that even\nbetrayal, like I said, it doesn't have to be that complicated. I think we can frame it differently. - Yeah, you can laugh at the whole thing. I mean, I think what we\ndon't often do with ourselves is look back at text\nor look back at emails or look back at Google\nsearch, I did that recently. Just looking at what I searched\nfor like 10 years ago, 15, it's like, forget last week. Just look at your Google\nsearches last week. And you're like, wait a minute, what? - [James] Right? - Why did you just search for this? - [James] Right, right. - 50 Times.\n- Right. Why did the karate kid\nthree pop into head? - [Lex] Yeah, exactly. - Why? - [Lex] And like your like- - Where's Ralph Macchio now? Where did the-\n- Who is he dating? - [James ] Yeah, yeah. - Vice and then mother\nand then you were like. - Oh, and then a restaurant nearby. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like how did I go from this to that? But it made sense at the time. - [Lex] Yeah. - So when you ask someone how did our relationship fall apart? It's like looking at the\nGoogle search history- - [Lex] Yeah. - Of yourself from tenure. You don't even know why you were thinking about those things.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And now you wanna understand\nwhy you did what you did. Felt what you felt,\nshe felt what she felt, she did what she did. And why the two of you,\nhow you impacted each other and interacted with each other. Really? You think that's doable? - In the courtroom, does that come up like text messages? - [James] Oh, yeah. - That resulted in with\nwhoever you're cheating with. You have to- - Yeah, I mean cheating\ndoesn't come up as much 'cause most states are\nno fault states now. So why someone's getting divorced, whether it's infidelity\nor it doesn't matter. There's no good spouse\nbonus or bad spouse penalty. - Well, there isn't. I mean, can you elaborate on that? Like that's-\n- Well you can have, we've had times where we\nhave to prove infidelity because we wanna prove what's called wasteful dissipation of marital assets. Which means that you were spending money that was marital money on a paramour. That's what the legal name for a ex, for a boyfriend or\ngirlfriend in the marriage. And usually the person calls\nit, you know that whore. - [Lex] Yeah. - Or that piece of shit.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - But we call them paramour. Yeah, the paramour.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Sometimes we have to prove\ninclination and opportunity. We have to prove that this\nperson had the inclination to cheat and that they had\nthe opportunity to cheat. And then we wanna show that,\nokay, so when they went away, that should be considered\ndissipation of marital assets. So if you go out to\ndinner with your brother, you didn't dissipate the marital estate, but if you bought your\nparamour a Tiffany bracelet, that would be a dissipation\nof marital assets and the person's entitled\nto a credit back for that from what was taken\noutta the marital estate. So we do sometimes have to\nauthenticate text messages on the witness stand or in depositions. And what's interesting about that is the way people approach it. Like people sometimes try to pretend, oh no, this is just my good friend, and which is just like,\nyou kill your credibility. Oh no, she's just my very good friend. She's not, she's not, that\nmakes no sense whatsoever, or no, we were just friends at that point. And then several months later is when we, once this marriage was over, that's when we got together as partner. - [Lex] Right.\n- That's ridiculous. But sometimes people just own it. Just own it. I did a deposition of an executive once and opposing counsel like thought they were gonna really hit 'em. They were like, and looking\nat this credit card receipt, what was this charge for for this hotel? He was like, oh, that was for a hotel room that I got with my girlfriend. And you were married? - Yes, yes. Where did you stay at the hotel? We didn't even stay. We actually just did\nlike an afternoon delight rolled around in bed for the day. - [Lex] (chuckles) Yeah. - And it was like, well now, you know, took all the thunder out of that. - What's the downside of doing that? It seems like a really- - There wasn't, it actually I\nthink helped his credibility. It was my client. So I thought it was the right move. We hadn't really discussed it in advance, but he was naturally\nintelligent enough to go, yeah. My credibility, I'm not\ngonna lie under oath, I'll admit what it was, but I'll do it in such an,\nwe did it like at the end, like Eminem at the end of \"Eight Mile.\" It was very like, yeah, I\ncheated on her with this person. Now tell these people something\nthey don't know about me. And that's kind of how I try to, as a trial lawyer, we actually in my firm refer to it as the \"Eight Mile\" strategy, which is like, we will, if I know there was a text message sent, you piece of, I hope you die. My client sent that text\nmessage to his co-parent. On my examination of\nmy client, I will say, I'd like to have this\nmarked for identification shown to the witness. What is that? It's a text message. Who's it to? Plaintiff. You sent it? Yeah. Read it out loud for the court. Do I have to? I think you should. You're a piece of S, does it say S? No.\n(Lex laughs) What does it say?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Well, it's a profanity. So you say it say, you piece of shit, I hope that she die. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You sent that to her? Yes. Why? I was really mad. Do you think that was good? No, do you think it was helpful for your co-parenting\nrelationship with her? No, why did you send it then? She sent me like 50\ntexts exactly like that. And I never responded. And I pushed it down every time, and then finally, I just blew up at her. If you had it to do over, again, would you do it differently? You know, I wish I could say I would, but the truth is I'm human\nand I was at my limits and I'm watching opposing counsel cross out entire sheets\nof their cross-examination 'cause it's gone now. They thought that they had\ntheir like Perry Mason moment, they had their like, did you\norder the code red moment? And it's gone now because if you just own and accept your fault or your\nissues in the relationship, you can take a lot of\nthe power outta that. - And I wish we wouldn't\ntake texts seriously. - I think we should have\nsubstantive discussions via text. I think text was designed\nfor, are you here? Yes. 15 minutes away, or I got\nhere safely, love you. Like that substantive discussions are people love having arguments via text. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And I have to say, when you read other\npeople's text messages, as I am often forced to do.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - It is amazing because just like that Google history you were talking about, I don't know how the hell you\ngot from one thing to another. Like I was just reading,\nactually on the way here, in the car, I was reading\nthrough a text exchange between two co-parents in\nthe middle of a custody thing that I'm involved in. And it's like, you piece of shit, you never cared about\nanything and I'm gonna take, you have no right to take\nthe kids from me, da, da, da. And then the next day, nothing in between. The next day, Maddie got a good\ngrade on her science thing. Oh, that's great, she's doing so well. It makes me so happy. Yeah, her teacher said\nshe's doing really well. Yeah, that's really great to see. I'll be there about 15 minutes late. No problem, see you then. Wait, like it was a day ago. I wanna know was there\na phone conversation in between where one of you went, \"Hey man, listen, I'm\nreally sorry about that. Oh no, look, we were both, whatever. Or is it just like you did that,\" and then we're supposed to\npretend that didn't happen and now we're just gonna talk about what Maddie got on her test. - Yeah, well, sometimes a good\nnap or a good night's sleep can solve a lot of emotional issues stuff. - I totally get it. But is there some, if you're looking just at the\ntexts, it begs the question, wouldn't she take the nap and then go, \"Hey, listen, I just woke up from the nap. It turns out I was really tired.\" Is that not happen by text? - No that's 'cause sometimes it's\nhard to probably apologize for being asshole, right? So I think we use just text. We humans use all kinds\nof forms of communication to kinda vent. I think it's the wrong thing to do, but people do do that. - Text has a permanence though. It's writing. I mean, it's writing. - You think like a lawyer.\n- [Lex] I like it. - Do think like a lawyer. But lawyers think like detail. And why would you write that down? Writing it down, would you write it down and would you put it on a\nbillboard in Times Square? 'Cause like that's, everything you say on\nFacebook or Instagram, can and will be used against\nyou in a court of law. Like every photo you post. I mean, that's going on\nwith a what's his name? Jake Paul or whatever Paul\nand Dillon Danis right now, that guy's girlfriend, every picture's ever\nbeen put on the internet of her by her is being\nweaponized right now. - To reference an earlier\npart of our discussion. That's love. You take a big risks. Big risk putting it out there. - [James] Yeah. - Putting it out there on text, putting it out there on social media. You take risks. - But is the reward of doing\nit via text worthwhile? Listen, the reward of love, I think is worth the risks of love. But the benefit of communicating by text, does it merit that risk\nof that being in writing, that the person can reflect on and review and scroll back and get\nheated up again about. - I don't know, we just take risks, and we're vulnerable with each other. - There may be something about text that for whatever reasons\ninspires a kind of candor because I think it is a new\nway to communicate, right? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- In the scheme of things. And so sometimes, we don't know the thing until it's really come into existence. So I don't know. I think it started as something\nthat we just communicated in a very extemporaneous, unplanned way. Like texts were meant to be, I'm here, I'm outside,\nwhatever it might be. And so what happens when you start to talk about more emotional,\ndeeper, bigger things, or visceral things or more\nemphatic passionate things using a technology that was originally just being used for the other purpose? I don't know the answer to that. What I do know is, yeah, as a lawyer, A, from an evidentiary perspective, and B, I just know what it\nlooks like on the outside. I know when I read it, what it looks like. And that's not always accurate. Like to just see the, it's like when you\nwatch a video of someone at just their worst moment, and the person that tries to say, but wait, that's not me. Like, that was just me in that moment. That was me at this incredible low point. And I think as a lawyer, my job is to weaponize that\nand to try to say, okay, this low point is indicative\nof who they actually are. - [Lex] Yeah. - And when I'm defending someone, I'm supposed to say, well,\nthis is their low point and we've all been to a low point and this is just a moment in this person and to judge them by that moment, would you wanna be judged\nby your worst moment? So I have to be able to look\nat that both directions. - Yeah, I mean, I don't think\nanyone looks great on text. - I mean, there's so\nmuch of our communication that is missing. Your expression. Like my sense of humor\ndoes not do well via text. 'Cause I have like sometimes\na sarcastic sense of humor- - [Lex] Yeah. - Or I have a dry sense of humor and it does not always\ntranslate well to text. The nuance of things is lost sometimes. - Yeah, but that's what makes\nthe risk of it hilarious. I mean, the emojis, the memes, all that, taking a risk. There's a risk with a text if you do some like dark dry statement, right? That's a joke. And then the pause, and then there's no\nresponse for a couple hours. I mean, that's beautiful, I don't know. That's- - It's the gap between the two trapezes, (Lex and James laughs) like once you've hit send and you're like, well, let's see where this goes? Like there's it coming back now, you know, and you're waiting and waiting. It's like that moment of just hang is, yeah, that's a rush. I mean, that's a rush. That's a beautiful thing. - Well, I have my friend\nMichael Malice living close by. And if the courtroom were ever\nto see the text between us, we would be both in jail. - [James] Okay.\n- For many- - [James] Who would have subpoena. - Many years, subpoena. Yeah, when this finally comes out, when I have my-\n- [James] Yeah. - We're gonna have Johnny\nDepp, Amber Heard moment. - [James] The subpoena's ready. - We'll get my (laughs) - Well, but that was one of, the Johnny Depp, Amber Heard\nthing was a great example of, in a gunfight between those two. Everyone was cheering for the bullets. I mean, no one was, I don't think anybody looked like a hero. They both looked like what\nthey are, which is humans. - [Lex] Yeah. - Really flawed humans who had, it really is like that that\nPeople magazine thing stars. They're just like us, you know. We watched that and went like, oh yeah, they're just like us. Like they cannot keep it together. They cannot have, like they\njust have these ridiculous toxic moments where both of\nthem looked awful in that trial. - Well, what do you take\naway from that trial? Just given all the work you've done. I mean, for me, I don't know\nif you can speak to that. It's probably the first\ntime I've seen that kind of a complicated relationship. Even just to say a relationship\nlaid out in this raw form. Yeah, like the fights of a relationship. - Yeah. My feeling about that trial\nis there is no amount of money that would be worth laying that\nkind of stuff bare publicly. - For you if you were dying down. - For me, yeah. There's no amount of money. - But for Amber Heard, I don't know which. - Because they both look awful. They both look awful. And I don't think I'm qualified to say if one of or both of them are awful. But they both had\nmoments in that courtroom where their behavior\nand words looked awful. And I just don't know that, that exposing that to the\nworld, I just don't know. I mean, I understand the point of view that by bringing that suit,\nJohnny Depp was saying, look, yeah, I have to show these awful\nthings to the world about myself, but it's not as bad as what\nshe's claimed I've done, so I get it, I'm not\nsaying that's incorrect. And for Amber Heard, I\nthink her response is, well, for him to say I'm lying. I have to prove my, but my God, like what\nan awful thing to watch. All it really is is just another, it's just another couple. You know how banal that is? You know, how many of the- - [Lex] So this kind\nof stuff happens a lot. - A lot? It's the norm. It's not the exception. They just happen to\nhave like a grand scale 'cause they have lots\nof people around them- - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And lots of money. But yeah, it's all this, that kind of dysfunction,\nthat kind of chaos, that kind of, he said, she said, two people with completely\ndiffering histories of what happened in the marriage. False allegations of domestic violence or true allegations of domestic violence that are completely denied by the person. And you have witnesses\nthat'll say, oh my God, they never engaged in any kind. 'Cause again, no one\nengages in domestic violence with company over, you\ndon't like invite friends. People always say like, oh no, I saw them. They seem so happy. People always do this to\nme as a divorce lawyer. They come in and they go, well, here's photos of\nthe kids smiling with me. So that's proof that like, I'm a good dad. And I'm like, there's photos\nof Jeffrey Dahmer smiling with people he ate later.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And you think these photos\nproof something like I don't- - [Lex] Yeah.\n- The lack of, I'm in the middle of a very\ncomplex domestic violence trial. And the entire defense\non the other side is, well, we have photos of them on vacation where they look very happy\nand she never called the cops. That's no defense at all. Most victims of intimate partner\nabuse don't call the cops. They don't identify, self-identify as victims of domestic violence. - And they probably have many stretches of time of intense happiness or happiness. - Of course, of course. And by the way, perpetrators\nof domestic violence are charismatic. How else would they get victims? It's not like if they were ogre-ish, no one would sign on\nfor that relationship. - [Lex] Yeah. - It's that when they're\ngood, they're so good, that when they're bad, you go, but wait, no, that's not him the really\ngood person is him or her. We saw that in the\npublic testimony of that, you know, Depp, Heard thing is, there were moments where you\nlook at her and go, oh my God. Like I want one, just like that. And there were moments where\nyou listen to the testimony and go, oh my God, she's awful. Like what? That's just evil.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And the same for him. So I really, this should\nteach us something about how not only are there\ntwo sides to every story, that there's just so much\ncomplexity and nuance to these. But I think it, everyone\nwas asking the question whether you were team\nDepp, team Heard or team, I could care less about\neither of these people. Everybody's looking at it going, why? Eight billion people in the world? Why did you stay together? Just break up. You're miserable. It's obvious. It's obvious you're not this, this can't be worth it. - I've actually become\nfriendly with Camille Vasquez, who's the lawyer on the Depp side. She's an incredible woman-\n- Great lawyer. - And just a great human being, just how passionate she's about her work. I mean, you radiate this\nkind of same passion. Like she's just truly\nhappy doing what she does. - [James] Yeah, yeah. - And but also where the\nstress of a case is like takes, like it is becomes her. You can't sleep all this kind of stuff, which is fascinating.\n- Yeah, I think that's a function\nof our professions. Even after 20 plus years of doing this, like the night before a\ntrial, I can hardly sleep. And I-\n- [Lex] The excitement, fear? - Yes, yes.\n- [Lex] Okay. - All of that. All of that. And and I even have moments\nas I pull up to the courthouse and I listen, I wear certain cuff links that are like my lucky\ncuff links or something, and I pull up to the courthouse. I walk into the courtroom and I have this feeling\nin the pit of my stomach. And then it starts, and the moment it starts,\nsomething in me goes, oh yeah, I know how to do this. - [Lex] Yeah. - And it's instantly, like\nI just, I own it, I love it. And it's, yeah, the\npeople that love this job, being a trial lawyer, being a particularly a\ndivorce trial lawyer, family law, trial lawyer, I love it. I love it. I love it more than I loved\nit when I started doing it. I still, you know, I can't imagine spending five days a week looking forward to two. I love what I do. I don't know that I'll ever love anyone or anything more than I love the work. - So I saw you on talk with\nSteve Harvey a bunch of times, and I always loved it. One thing just sticks in my\nhead from something he said as a device that if you and\nyour partner, your spouse, if there's a fight, there's a difficult thing\nyou have to deal with. Keep that to yourself. Don't talk to anyone else. Like that's a little,\nlike a what does he say? Like a two arm circle or something, whatever the expression is. - [James] Yeah. - But basically resolve it all internally. Don't like when you face the world, you have a front of like rock solid. - Don't take sides against the family. - Yeah. (laughs)\n- [James] Yeah, it is. - Like it all boils down to \"Godfather.\" - Yeah, everything boils down\nto \"Godfather\" references. It really does.\n- And \"True Romance.\" - Yeah, you don't take\nsides against the family. You don't show that weakness to the world. I mean, again, I don't know that, I don't know that Steve\nin candor would say you shouldn't discuss it with\nyour own therapist, you know? - [Lex] Sure. - But I think what he's saying is don't project it out to the world. Don't share that, because\nI think, you know, it can change the way people\nview your relationship, which then will change the way\nyou view your relationship, - [Lex] Yeah. - And so I think don't run reckless when it comes to that primary relationship. Don't run your mouth recklessly. - Yeah. It's one of the things I\nmentioned to you offline that, my now close friend Joe Rogan, I've never heard him ever\nspeak negatively of his wife. It's always like super positive, how awesome of a person she is. And that to me has always\nbeen an inspiration to do the same for everybody in my life, to always speak positively about them. That has a probably a\nvirtuous spiral effect. - I'm sure. That's probably because\nhe has a great wife and he has a great wife\nin part because of that. - [Lex] Yeah. - I think it's clear\nthat he's in her corner and cheering for her. It's clear she's cheering for him. It's not like Joe Rogan's not\na man who has opportunity. I mean, he's surrounded by UFC\nring girls for god's sakes. This is a guy who has all\nthe opportunity in the world, and he seems to be\nquite a fan of his wife. And that is that's a superpower. Like that's a real thing. Now the question is, is, you know, he doesn't\nseem to talk about it. Like, oh, I gotta really work at that. - [Lex] Yeah. - And that's not a man who's afraid to talk about what he works at. He's pretty honest about, man, yeah, I gotta work really hard to stay in show. I gotta work really hard\nto be able to do this. Like Yeah, I'm not good\nat memorizing that. It takes time.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - But I've never heard him say like, oh, marriage is a lot of work. And I think that's to his credit, because it seems like\nthey're enjoying that. - [Lex] Yeah. - And it's also not incredibly public. It's not something, most people couldn't\npick her out of a lineup. - He kept it private for many years. And just because it's a private joy, it's a private deep, meaningful,\nintimate partnership. That's interesting. That's also an inspiration. Not everything about\nyour life has to be this. Look at me, I'm happy. I'm in a happy relationship. Everything is wonderful. - Especially that, I think there is something about the womb like cocoon like joy, you know, of like love. When you're just tucked in, snuggled in, like just pressed against\neach other with that. Like that, that's such a, you know, it's just the two of you.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And that's lovely.\n- [Lex] Yeah, that's peace. And that's such a good thing. We were just dying for connection. And that connection is so big. It's so everything. One of my earliest\npsychedelic experiences, probably when I was a teenager, but a theme that's been persistent in every psychedelic\nexperience I've ever had, is this idea of like,\neverything is connection. Everything is being pressed\nto someone and with them, like the warmth of human connection. One of the reasons I enjoy\nlistening to your work and your perspective has always been that I think at the core you\nsee connection and love. And I think for me, from my earliest experiences\nwith psychedelics at 16, 17, I was very attuned to that. I was very much, that was put\non my radar by psychedelics and just stayed part of\nmy consciousness forever. And I think I had a 30\nsomething year break from psychedelics, but it was like, when I came back to it, I went, oh yeah, it's still there. That's still the core of everything, is connection. - I mean, it's fascinating how\ndeeply you value connection, how empathic you are that you would be doing what you're doing which is, or is it not? - [James] I think it the opposite. - Counterintuitive. - No, I think it's actually why I'm well-suited for what I do. I think what I do is I have to\nlearn the story of my client and know it and feel it very deeply. And I have to feel it in a very human way that's very compassionate to this person. And then I have to feel it\nand understand it in a way that's incredible antagonistic to it, so I can shore up defenses. So I have to feel this\nperson's story and feelings from every possible angle, because every one of\nthem is a vulnerability and every one of them\nis a potential strength and a potential defense. And so I actually think\nit's my number one, other than extemporaneous\nspeaking ability, it is my number one\njob tool is the ability to radically empathize and to put myself in the\nemotional state of someone, in its best possible light\nand its worst possible light, so that I can see again the defense and I can see the vulnerability. - But I mean, so that's beautifully put. But also just to bear witness\nto this connection broken in the-\n- [James] Yeah. - In those dramatic way over\nand over and over and over. - That part is hard. But I was a hospice volunteer\nfor many, many years when I first got out of college. And it really showed me a lot about what is sadness, what is tragic, and what is just inevitable decay? What is pain and decay? We all die. We play a game you\ncan't win to the utmost. And so if we know the\nanswer to all of this is you're going to die, then what do we do with\nthe rest of that time? If all your stuff is just stuff, it's just gonna go to the, you know, the money's gonna go, everything is, your looks is gonna go, your everything's gonna go, love's gonna end one way another, then what are we doing? And again, I think it's\nlove and connection, but what I'm doing for\na living is helping. And I don't look at it\nas what I'm doing is helping people beat the\ncrap out of each other. I look at it as I'm\ntrying to help a client build their post-divorce life to sort of rise from the ashes of that which has fallen apart and move on to the next\nchapter and refocus and have the things they need\nfinancially, emotionally, whatever it might be interpersonally in terms of with their kids. And so for me, it's actually a job that is very consistent with my\ndesire to build connection and to be empathetic. - And witnessing the asterisks\ndoesn't make you cynical about the whole thing of love. - No, because again, 56% of\nmarriages end in divorce, but 84% are remarried within five years. We keep doing it over and over again. - [Lex] And that's a good thing. That's a-\n- I think it is a good thing. - The mess of it, the absurdity of it, the hypocrisy of it. That's something beautiful about that. - Well, it's just the return\nis so great on the investment. Listen, man, I've had more than one dog. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like when my dog died,\nthe first dog I had died, I remember when I'm\nnever gonna love again. I'm done, I'm done with this. I will never expose myself\nto this kind of pain again. I'll never have to take the dog bed and put it in the closet and like, ugh. And then some friend called me and said, \"We have an adoption event. Can you just watch this dog for 24 hours and then we'll take him.\" We just need you know, and I went, \"Yeah, right. I'll watch\na dog for the night,\" you know, da, da, da,\nand this dog come in. He said, oh, he has mane. He's not going. Fuck, I got another dog. He walked in and my heart went, yeah, I got a dog. And now that dog is 13 years\nold and his eyes are cloudy and he doesn't go up the stairs real well. And he is gonna break my heart. And I wouldn't change that for the world. - I'm still there. I'm still struggling for the second one. I lost a dog and it broke my heart. And yeah, but- - And you'll never lose that pain. But I promise you, your heart has an infinite capacity for the kind of love\nyou felt with that dog. And you'll never feel a\nlove that replaces the hole. There will never be another Buster for me. But there was Kaba\n(Lex laughs) and like-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - You know what? And when he's gone, there will\nnever be another one of him. But you know what? Like when that stupid puppy that was five months old stumbled in, I went, I guess I'm gonna do this again. And you know what? I'm so glad, I'm so glad, and I know by the way, I know now because, and that's where I've said like, you know, it's that Joseph Brodsky poem, a song like, \"I wish I knew No\nAstronomy when stars appear.\" I wish I didn't know the pain. But you know what? I don't care. I don't care. And I believe we don't care. Again, I think there's something to that. It's something hurts so badly and you go, I'm gonna do it again. I'm gonna do it, then it must be of value. It must be of real value. - There's also a different\nperspective on it, that pain. So there's that from \"Louie\"\nthe show of this interaction with an old man with Louie CK. And he says that, 'cause Louis is mourning the loss of, got split up, he got dumped or whatever. And he's mourning the loss\nof that partner of love. And the old man says that\nthat is the best part. Like missing the love is still love. The real bad part is when you forget it, when the pain fades.\n- [James] Yeah. - And it's all gone. But the pain is actually\na kind of celebration of the love you have.\n- Of course. Well, the opposite of love isn't hate, the opposite of love is indifference. - [Lex] Yeah. - There's no question about that. I mean, hate is a passionate emotion. Love is a passionate emotion. And there is a school of thought that says that only unfulfilled love\ncan be truly romantic. But I believe that, it's what I think I learned\nfrom hospice is that I think for me, knowing the\nimpermanence is the thing, it's the key. - Yeah, it's finite and\neventually it's gonna be over. And so like that intensifies\nthe feeling that, that's when you can have\npure love without the drama. - Dogs are, for me, a great example. And again, I don't know\nwhat it all means, right? Existentially, but I just\nfeel like they have that, that kind of love has to be\nhere to teach us something. And I feel like the fact\nthat they're so amazing and just so loving and so wonderful, and the bond we feel\nis so amazing and deep and doesn't require a lot of maintenance. And yet it's so finite. Like it's just this short little lifespan. And I feel like there's\njust such a lesson there, there's so much there to unpack about the nature of connection and loss and that your heart has\nthis infinite capacity. Like when you're, I'm telling you, when my dog died, when Buster died, I remember thinking with certainty, I will never do this again because I'll never love that way again. I'll never love a dog\nthe way I love this dog. And it's just not true. That's just not true. You have this infinite capacity, and that makes it scary actually, because like right now, there's so many people you could love. There's so many dogs you could love. Like there's so much out there, and it's requires a certain bravery and tremendous amount of risk to do it. - And a commitment, because I think to really experience\nlove is you just dive in, 'cause there is a huge number of people. But to really like, I\nmean, you have to like really dive into the full complexity, the full range of another human being. - Yeah, which is hard\nbecause we don't even, I don't know that we even feel comfortable diving into the full range of ourselves. There's pieces of ourselves\nwe try to push away or not think about or. - Okay. So speaking of the whole\nsociopath slash empath that is all embodied in one\nhuman being, that is you. Let's go back to some cases\nperhaps that you've worked on. Just something that stands out to you. What's maybe the craziest, most complicated thing you've worked on? Is there something that pops to mind? - Craziest would be different\nthan most complicated. - [Lex] Let's go craziest. - Yeah, so craziest, ah, gosh, that's a great question. So from a chaos standpoint, I mean, I see so many\nbizarre fact patterns and so many variations of\npeople cheating with people, people sleeping with the nanny,\npeople sleeping with the, someone, a relative of their spouse, people having same sex or\npolyamorous relationships, and the other person doesn't even know they're not monogamous. Like so much craziness that\nyou could fill 15 books. In terms of complexity, I mean, emotionally\ncomplex is any custody case is emotionally complex because you're dealing\nwith parenting issues. And what makes a good parent, I think is a very tricky\nquestion because, you know, I'm trying to convince a\njudge who's a better parent, and that is so loaded with\nsubjective value judgements. - Is there just to linger\non the maternal presumption, is that a thing you come face-to-face with often in the court? - Well, there was, I mean,\nit was real, it was the law. There was something in the law called the maternal presumption. It was also known as the\ntender years doctrine, which meant that a child\nunder the age of seven was presumed to be in\nthe custody of the mother unless you could show\nshe was an unfit mother. So that's where the idea of\nlike someone has to be proven an unfit mother came from\nnow in the '80s, 1980s, that was changed. But under my skin is under my sovereignty. I mean, you can't suggest that there isn't in the world a suggestion that\na mother who births a child and feeds a child with her body doesn't have a particular\nbond with a child that's different than a\nfather's bond with a child. So where do we put that? How much importance do we put on it. Now that there's better and more research in the mental health field about attachment theory and infants. There's also a lot of, you know, a lot of research\non how is attachment formed, how should parenting\nschedules be put together based on attachment theory. But, you know, there's\nconflicting perspectives on that. - And so as judge to judge you see like, is there a lot of variation? - Yeah, there is because\nthere's lots of kinds of judges. Like there's judges that\nare thoughtful, enlightened, interested in the mental health research. And there's judges that just want, were unsuccessful lawyers\nthat were good politically and got elected and they\njust wanna, you know, they just want a job where like they show up at nine o'clock, they have a lunch break\nfrom 12 until two o'clock and that they leave at 4:30 and they get a certain\nnumber of weeks vacation and a pension after 20 years. - So what is in general the process of these custody battles? Like what's the landscape here? - Well, most, the overwhelming\nmajority of custody cases don't end up in my office. They are a negotiation between two people that love their children more than they dislike\ntheir soon to be ex. So the overwhelming majority of cases are just two people going, okay, how are we gonna\nmake decisions together? 'Cause there are decisions that\nhave to be made about kids. Will they go to public or private school, can they go on medication\nif they need it or not, should we change pediatricians, all those kinds of things. How do we make decisions and when will we each\nspend time with the kids? And so most custody cases are just that. Most custody cases are just a discussion, a negotiation between\ncounsel about those issues. And they're not ugly and\nthey're not anything. They're just people. Again, sometimes people\nhave differing perspectives, you know, but sometimes\npeople haven't thought through their perspective. So as a divorce lawyer, a lot of what I'm doing\nis counseling a person because they come in and say, well, I've been the person who handles, all of the homework and\nall of the everything. So he should only see\nthe kids on weekends. And there's a logic to that. I've always done the\nhomework with the kids. So I'm the parent who's\nin charge of the homework and he's obviously not done that before. But there's also a logic\nthat you can then say, right? But then you're doing all the\nheavy lifting of parenting and he's doing none of that. And you were a married\ncouple and living together. So he was trusting you to do that 'cause you're good at it\nand you seem to like it. So maybe now we want him to have to do some of the heavy lifting of parenting because we don't want the\nchild when they're 13 to say, I love dad, we have nothing\nbut a good time together. Whereas you make me do my\nhomework and eat my broccoli. Dad's the grass on the other side of the fence that's greener. So sometimes it's about\neducating a client to like change their frame, you know,\nto look at this differently. Yeah, okay, we always go to\nmy mother's for Thanksgiving, so I need every Thanksgiving. Okay, well you were\nmarried so you went to, now you're gonna have new traditions, things are changing for your children, things are changing for your family. You're both gonna have new traditions. So a lot of times it's\njust educating people on looking at things in a different way, looking at their parenting\nin a different way. We're not gonna live in\nthe same house anymore, but we're still gonna parent these child, this child or these children together. What's much more interesting\n'cause like, you know, I don't get invited to a lot of parties, but when I get invited to\nparties, if somebody says, what do you do for a living?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And I say, I'm a divorce lawyer. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And they go, oh my God, you must have stories. That's the way everybody said, oh my God, you must have so many stories. And if I said, yeah, there was this couple and they, you know, slowly grew apart and then they decided that it would be good for them to end their\nrelationship as a married couple, but they wanted to continue to have an amicable co-parenting relationship. So they divided their assets, and they figured out a good\nparenting access schedule that made sure that they both had, both leisure time and\nresponsibilities with the children. People would be like, that's\nthe worst fucking story. Yeah, that's so boring.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - So what they really want is the like, and then he was sleeping with the nanny and then she caught him. So, you know, the truth is like, people want to hear\nabout those flame outs. And by the way, those are super\ninteresting as the lawyer. Like it's super interesting. - It's usually gonna be what? Infidelity. You do have a chapter called\nEverybody fucks the Nanny. - Everybody is fucking the nanny. - Everybody is fucking. - Yeah, there's a nanny\nfascination out there. I try to explain it in the book, but yeah, I mean I've had\nsome great nanny stories. I mean, people run off with the nanny. People end up getting\nmarried to the nanny. I had one he convinced her that they should have a\nthreesome with the nanny. They got the nanny drunk. They had a bunch of\nthreesomes with the nanny and then the nanny and the\nwife paired up and left him. - [Lex] Oh, nice. - And they're still quite happy. - [Lex] That seems like a\nhappy ending the whole family. - For everyone but him,\nbut it was his idea, - Well, he's really gonna\nhave a nanny fascination now. - Now he's, yeah, well, now he's gotta see the nanny who's now the like stepparent to the kids. And it was his bright idea of let's have a threesome with the nanny. Yeah, I mean the nanny thing\nI think is a function of, in many circumstances\nis the characteristics of the wife that he remembers fondly and that have been extinguished\nby the presence of children. So my words of wisdom is\nnot don't get a nanny, or make sure you get an ugly nanny. My thought on it is that\na woman should remember even when she's a mother, that\nshe's also a woman who a man, you know, they fell in\nlove with each other and she should take time to be in touch with the part of herself\nthat is an independent woman, that's interesting and interested. And, you know, there's a lot to be learned from divorced couples\nbecause divorced couples, if you do it right, it's awesome. I had a wonderful experience\nparenting and being divorced, 'cause I divorced when\nmy kids were quite young. My co-parent, you know,\nmy ex-wife is awesome. She's a great mom, nice person. We're good friends. And it was great. I had half the time I had my\nkids and I could focus on them. And the other half of the time they were with the other\nperson who loves them as much as I do. And I didn't have any of the\nresponsibilities of kids. And I could just have\nall of the wonderful fun that you can have when\nyou don't have, you know, the responsibilities that\ncome with full-time caring for children so. - What would you say now\non the flip positive side, we've been talking about\nthe collapse of things, what about success? What's the secret to a\nsuccessful romantic relationship? - My mom used to say that it's\nhard to define intelligence, but you could spot stupid a mile away. (Lex laughs)\n- Yeah. - So I'm much better at pointing out where people fall apart, 'cause I spend a lot of time with people who have fallen apart\nin their relationship. So it's easy to then say, well,\njust don't do what they do. But I don't know that that's\nnot an oversimplification. So again, I think the\nanswer is connection. I think the answer is affection, presence, you know, mindfulness and presence. I do think in my personal\nand professional experience, that most people want you fully more than they just want\nyou in a disconnected way. So if you were to say to\nyour romantic partner, you can have me for two hours where I'm giving you\nmy undivided attention and I'm really joyful to be with you. Or you can have me for eight hours where I'm sort of half paying attention and I kind of want to be someplace else for part of the time. There's just no choice there. It's so obvious. So I think presence is a big piece. And I think that, the you, the me, and the\nwe, I think is important, because I think in relationships, there's you and there's me and we meet and something magical happens, you know. And we become, we. And now there's you and\nthere's me and there's we, and then the we gets bigger\nand bigger and bigger. And isn't it great? 'Cause it's such a nice warm place. It gets so big, but it gets so big that you\nget small and me gets small, 'cause we, and if any of us dares to ask, well what about you, what about me? No, no, the we, what? You don't like the we? You don't wanna be with\nthe we like, whoa, whoa. No, it's not that. But we only exists 'cause\nthere was you and there was me, and I really liked you\nand you really liked me. And so we picked each other\nout of lots of choices. And now this we is so fucking big. Like it threatens to\njust consume all of it. And I really think that there's something there we\nhave to look at more, honestly. - So we should not consume everything, but it at the same time, not be small. - Well, the we is the you and the me, and if you mix it so much\nthat you and me loses, you know, it's components\nthat all that's left is we. I don't think that\nthat's the way to do it. I just think there's a, the world pulls us in that direction. Like we get told culturally that, well, why aren't you going\nwith this person to that? Why would you do that by yourself? And why? Like anyone knows that\nthere's joy in being away from each other and there's\njoy being reunited together. So why don't we, you know,\nspeak very honestly about that. And I think some of that's\nour own insecurity, you know, well, why don't you wanna\nbe with me 24 hours a day? Aren't I wonderful? Aren't I delightful? It's like, well wait, what? - Well, but also probably\npeople are either afraid or lazy in developing\ntheir individual selves. I mean, it's still, it's lonely going out there\nin the world by yourself, and it's comforting in\nthat little cocoon of we. - I mean it can also be\nincredibly adventurous. - [Lex] Right. - Going out into the world by yourself and then coming back to\nthe we with a full report. - [Lex] Yeah. - Coming back and saying like- - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Oh my God, guess what I saw, guess what I did? I'm like, we have to\ngo there together now. Because all I could think about was you. - [Lex] Yeah. - While I was there I was like, oh my god, she would love this.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - You know, like, that's magical. That's amazing. Look what I brought you back, I went in for this and then I got you this\npresent from there. - [Lex] Yeah. - There's something, you\nknow, and we know this, I always thought it was, you know, like when you watch the old westerns, or like the hero is leaving, and he's walking away from the cabin 'cause he's gonna go fight the gunfight and she runs up and she goes, please don't go, don't go, stay here with me.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And he like kisses her and then he goes. - [Lex] Yeah. - You know, if he goes\nlike, yeah, you're right, I'll just stay here, it's cool. You know, like, this is, I didn't wanna deal with that anyway. He's not the hero anymore then. - Yeah. (laughs) Yeah, deep truth to that. And then probably like you mentioned, sex. - [James] Sex is. - Probably a big part of it. Friendship. That seems to me like\na really important one. - Depends on how you define friend. If being a friend means\nwe have some connection to each other and we have each\nother's cell phone numbers, okay, then we're friends. But if it's a bigger definition than that, if it's like you've picked\nme up at the airport, or like you're someone I could call- - [Lex] Right. - That it's like, dude,\nI gotta hide a body. Like you get shovel in a lime, you know. - I like how you escalated\nfrom airport pickup- - [James] Yeah.\n- To murder. - [James] Yeah, I try\nto go to two direction. - [Lex] You're a true New Yorker. - I tell you, I define\nthe Ben Affleck movie, \"The Town,\" that scene,\nthat's friendship to me. I mean, to me, the ideal\nmale friendship is the scene where he says, \"I need\nyou to come with me. We're gonna hurt some people and you never have to\nask me about it again.\" - [Lex] Oh yeah. - And he says, \"Whose car are we taking?\" - [Lex] Yeah. - And that's sort of like,\nto me, that's friendship. So it's a high bar, you\nknow, to be like a friend. So when you say like, friendship, I think that's the kind of friendship you should ideally have\nwith your romantic partner. If you're getting married. It should be the like\nwhose car are we taking? Like it should be that, it's you and me. - To be fair, that bar is reached with me with a lot of people. - [James] Yeah. - Like if you call me\ntomorrow, there's a body. - But you're a big open,\nyou're a big open heart. - But it's true. I wonder how many people out there are like that in terms of hiding the body. - I mean, my theory on this, 'cause I think I'm like you in that way. I think I'm very sensitive. I feel things really deeply, and I think that's a teriff, the world is terrifying when\nyou feel things very deeply, because there's so much pain,\nthere's so much betrayal, there's so many opportunities to be hurt. And I think when you\nare that kind of person, you go through like stages. And one of them is that I don't care. I don't feel anything. It doesn't matter, I don't feel anything. I don't feel anything,\nI don't feel anything. You try to convince yourself,\nI don't feel anything. It's fine, I don't feel anything. And then at some point like, you know, you do feel all of it. And then it's like, oh my God, the weight of this is crap. I mean I think it's the whole\narc of Pink Floyd, \"The wall.\" (Lex laughs) It's literally-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - The entire arc of Pink Floyd \"The Wall.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And the song \"Stop.\" I wanna go home, take off this\nuniform and leave the show. Like you just, when you feel all of it, the army of hammers coming at you, the slings and arrows\nof outrageous fortune. A thousand natural shocks,\nthe flesh is heir to. When you feel all of that deeply. It's very hard. But, but it can also be a superpower. Because I think when you can\nbring that to a relationship, when you can bring that to a profession like you've done and I've done, then there's something\nvery magical about that. The ability to bring it out in someone, to feel it in yourself, to understand it, is a gift. It's a wonderful, wonderful gift. I'm humbled by what it\nbrought me professionally. And I'd like to think that\nyou and I have both found professions that enable us\nto use that sensitivity, that empathy in a productive and good way. And in a fulfilling, a\npersonally fulfilling way. And ideally in a way that\ndoes good for other people. - You yourself are incredibly\nsuccessful and high performer. You've dealt with a lot of CEOs and just high performers\nin all walks of life. What can you say about\nsuccessful relationships with those kinds of folks? - [James] That's a good question. I think- - Is it all the same stuff or there's something\nspecial when they're busier? - Well, you know, I\nthink when you represent high net worth individuals,\nbut also high performing, I would make a distinction\nbetween high net worth and high performing. I've done high net worth\ndivorces where the person's like a trust fund kid-\n- [Lex] Ah. - Even though they're an adult,\nyou know, but they're like, what they did to achieve\ntheir high net worth status is their great-grandfather died. - [Lex] Sure. - So that is different than\nsomeone who is self-made, who through discipline,\nfocus, entrepreneurship, whatever it might be. That they have found success. And there's also difference\nbetween financial success and fame 'cause I've\nrepresented famous people that actually did not have that much money in the scheme of things or much liquidity. And I've represented people that, that were not in any way famous and were very high\nperforming in their field. Like in New York, we have\na lot of finance people so. And what I find is their\ndivorces are challenging. One, on a technical level because figuring out what they have and how to divide it is tricky. - [Lex] Sure, yeah. - Because when something's\nmoving that quickly, like when your portfolio's movement affects a market, that's challenging. Jeff Bezos divorce for a time when it was in its early stages\ncould affect Amazon stock. It did, you know, so that's a real thing. There are businesses that\nare affected by a divorce. But in terms of being in a\nrelationship with someone who is a high performing person. You know, most of the high\nperforming people I know are creatures of discipline and routine. From a Joe Rogan, we've talked\nabout any of these people, like they have a routine,\nthey have a discipline, they have a focus. They have a way they like to do things. They have a type of\ncoffee they like to drink. They have a way that they like to do. And divorce is a tremendous disruption. I mean, divorce is fundamental\nthings in your life are shifted out of your control. Like your spouse may be\nthe one who has decided you are no longer going\nto live in that house. You will no longer see your\nchildren on these days. So to take that control away from someone is very, very hard. I mean, when someone is a high performing, high net worth person, they are used to being told, yes, they're used to being able to buy their way out of a problem. But just like illness.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - You can hire the best doctor, but you can't cure cancer\nbecause you have a lot of money. Like you can hire the best lawyer, but you can't cure a custody case. I mean, Angelina Jolie\nand Brad Pitt's seemingly endless custody disputes that have been going on for years now with the best lawyers in\nCalifornia working on them is proof of the fact that you can't just buy a resolution to those things. That you have to go through\nit just like everyone else. - So that, lets me ask the question of how much does it divorce usually cost? - That's a great question. Average divorce, I mean\nit's sort of like a, what I always tell clients\nin the first consultation is I tell them the most\nreasonable question a person could ask me\nsitting in that chair across from me is two. How long is this gonna take\nand how much is it gonna cost? And those are the two\nquestions I can't answer. And then the next thing they\nsay is, give me a range. (Lex chuckles) Which is a bit like calling\nyour doctor and saying, \"I have a headache. What is it?\" Well, I can't tell you,\nI'd have to do tests. Give me a range. Okay. It's a reaction to the barometric pressure and it'll be gone in 15 minutes, or it's a brain aneurysm and\nyou'll be dead in five minutes. There's your range. And so it didn't really help, right? - [Lex] Yeah. - I have the least expensive\ndivorce I've ever seen is two people, one of whom comes into my office and says, we've written down on a yellow pad what we figured out at the kitchen table. She's gonna keep the house, I'm gonna keep the 401k, we have a bank account at this bank, we're gonna split that 50-50. I'm gonna pay her this much\nin child support each month. And we're gonna agree from time to time on what we're gonna do in terms of the schedule with the kids. But they're primarily gonna live with her. Can you write this up and\nmake it legally binding? Yes, 3,500 bucks. - Just as a side note, I have a friend who went through a divorce and handled it just masterfully by giving more than he's supposed to and having nothing but love in his heart and happiness with the kids. And just like, I don't know, that to me\nis just an inspiration. His whole view was like,\nwho cares about money? - [James] Well, yeah.\n- And also like, he refused with every ounce of his being to have anything but complete\nlove for the other person. - Yeah, I've had clients\nwho with a straight face will say to me like, well, I'm not gonna quibble\nover a few million dollars. And they mean it, because to\nthem it's numbers on a page. So I'll personalize this a bit. So I have a friendly\nrelationship with my ex-wife, who's the mother of my\nsons who are adults. And we have maintained a\nvery good relationship. And so now it's many years divorced later, 17, 18 years later. And we were able to sort of\npost-game that relationship, even our co-parenting relationship. We kind of post-game it when\nwe chat with each other. And I remember once saying to her, yeah, you never, you know, you never like screwed around with me when it came to the kids. You were always so like, cool, you know. Like if I called you, if I was having a really bad day at work or like see in just an ugly custody case, and like I just felt like I\nwould call her and say like, \"Hey, can I just pick the boys up and like take 'em out for ice\ncream or something tonight? I know it's not my night, but would you mind if I\njust like took 'em out for a couple hours?\" She'd be like, \"Yeah, sure, come on by.\" She was always flexible like that. And I said to her like,\n\"What was that just goodwill? You're just a good person,\nor what was that about?\" And she was like, \"Yeah,\nit was partly that,\" but she was like, it was partly that like, you never screwed around with\nme when it came to money. If the kids needed something\nor if I needed something as the mother of the kids, like, you were always like,\nyeah, sure, of course. Her air conditioning kicked out and she needed it to replace it and she didn't have like\nliquidity at the time. And I didn't have a lot\nof money at the time 'cause it was a long time ago. And I was like, all right, no, no, no, 'cause I don't want you hot and upset and I don't want the boys,\nto be in like, of course. And so I think, yeah, when you approach a conflict with like, it's very hard to argue with someone who won't argue with you. If the person approaches the argument from the point of view of like, I'm not gonna argue with you. I'm gonna absorb your aggression. I'm gonna just not meet it with that. I'm gonna meet it with love. I'm gonna meet it with positivity. It doesn't always work, 'cause sometimes people are\nso angry that they just are, they're relentless.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - But I have to tell you, the louder you get, the quieter I get, the more you seem irrational. And that's what I always try to bring\nthat to court proceedings. I always try to bring to court. Like if I know my\nadversary's coming in hard, I'll come in quiet and slow and deliberate because I want the volume to be turned up way too high over there. And then it looks like what\nit, what's the, your honor, what's their problem over there? And I think that, I say this to clients. They got a four year old, they're getting divorced, let's say. There's gonna be a wedding\nin like 20 something years. There's gonna be a wedding and it's either gonna be the wedding where they gotta put these people on opposite sides of the room, 'cause if they pass each\nother by the shrimp boat, they're gonna kill each other. Or it's the wedding where\nlike you stand there, you take some pictures,\nyou kind of go like, yeah, we fucked up this\nwhole marriage thing, but maybe we did a good job\nwith this kid, didn't we? And the decisions you make right now, there's a straight line to that wedding. And so even if you don't like this person, even if you're mad at them, even if you're mad at\nyourself for the choices you made in choosing them as a co-parent. Every single Mother's Day for 27 years, I have told my now longtime\nex-wife \"Happy Mother's Day.\" I'm so glad that we had kids together. I'm so glad you're the mother of my kids, 'cause they wouldn't be who they are if it wasn't that they\nwere part me and part you. And I'm so grateful for you, and, you know, I'm\nalways cheering for you. How hard is that? How hard is that? - [Lex] Well, it's really\nhard for some people. - I don't understand why\nit's so hard for some people. I'll tell you, I do find that hard. There's not a lot of things\nthat I kinda don't understand, but that's one that I\nkinda don't understand. Like I put in, one of the weird things I\ndid did as a divorce lawyer that caused like a little\nstir among my colleagues for a few years. With some years ago, we all steal from each\nother's work, divorce lawyers. We're like the matrimonial mafia. We all know each other, we all deal with each\nother over and over again, but we all have the same job. And so we are the only\npeople that really know the unique stresses of that job. So even though we try to\nkill each other all day, it's like boxer, like\nprofessional fighters like, yeah, your job's to take\neach other's head off, but like nobody knows what\nthe two of you went through, like the two of you.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - That's why like, I always get like, I go like all kinds of rubbery\nwhen I see after the fight. Like the two people hug each other. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Because I'm always like-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - 'Cause you know what? They relate to each other\nbetter than anybody. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- They suffered, they bled. the competitors, they bled. So I really think divorce lawyers, we have that same kind of relationship. We went through this\nstress on opposite sides, trying to take each other apart. And I find that, we all steal from each other's material when it comes to separation agreements, provisions that we use for agreements. Like all the agreements are\nlike these Frankenstein monsters of, oh, I like his estate\nplanning provisions. So I like her provisions related to maintaining a life insurance policy to secure the alimony award. And I wrote this\nparagraph or this section, because what occurred to me is that when you have a child with someone, and let's say they're\nthree or four or five, they're old enough to\nknow what Christmas is, but they're not old enough to\ngo buy a Christmas present, but they're old enough to know that you get presents on Christmas and you give presents on Christmas, but they're not old enough\nto buy one for the parent. So someone has to do that for them. So I thought, I'm gonna put\nin a provision that says that as long as the children are so young that they can't independently\npurchase a mother's day or a birthday present for the co-parent, that you'll take the children\neither to buy a small gift or to make a card, something like that. This struck me as a no-brainer, who could disagree with this? It's not for the person, it's for the kid. It's so the kid, \"Happy Birthday, Mom.\" I don't have a present for you. I don't have a card for you,\n'cause I'm fucking five. - [Lex] (laughs) Yeah.\n- Like I'm five. You can't go do that. So wouldn't you want your child, not your co-parent, who cares? Maybe you want them to have\nthe worst birthday ever, fine. But you don't want your\nchild to be embarrassed. And I even put in the provision, the parties acknowledged that it is the intention of this provision to ensure that the\nchild is not embarrassed and feels that they were able to say, I cannot tell you how many\npeople refuse to sign that. How many lawyers said to\nme, we're taking that out. And I went, \"Wait, why?\" Well, why does my client have to buy a present for your client? I said, \"They're not buying\na present for my client. They're buying a present for\nthe child to give to my client. It can be one of those\nlittle $3 boxes of chocolates they sell at the drugstore.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - Like it's a kid, they don't know. They don't know what anything is. - [Lex] Oh.\n- And people, Nope. And I have to tell you of\nthe conundrums of the puzzles that I can't figure out in existence. That's when I can't figure, I do not understand why that's so hard. - That's basically just an illustration of their complete inability\nto do anything nice for the other person. - The level, right the level of hatred, the level of vitriol that they- - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Maybe this is me, if you apologize, there's not a lot I won't forgive. I'm not saying I'll forget it. I'm not saying, \"Oh, we're totally good\nlike it never happened.\" I understand that. But if someone says what I call a non bullshit apology, right? A bullshit apology is, oh, I'm sorry, you got\nso upset when I did that. That's a bullshit apology. I'm sorry that you were offended. That's a bullshit apology. Or I'm sorry for what I did because what are we talking about? We might not be talking\nabout the same thing. Or you might be saying, I'm sorry that you found out about that, not that you did it. So a real apology is, I lied to you and I\nrealized that that hurt you, and I'm really sorry, I\nshouldn't have done that. I regret that I did that\nand I know that it hurt you and I'm really sorry. That's a real apology, okay. So someone's willing to give you that and you still wanna walk around with like, the level of vitriol that\nyou will harm your child rather than do something nice for them. I don't have a solution. And I say I see that all the time. Like parental alienation is a thing. It is a thing. Like children can be weaponized. I always tell people,\nyou wanna get married. Get married, get a prenup ideally. But if you don't have a prenup, okay, you're just risking money, don't worry. You're just risking money. Money and hassle, of paperwork and of time and of going through an\nugly financial divorce. But you have a kid with somebody, that is a missile. Like that person has a power over you for a long time, if not forever. - So the child could be used\nas part of a manipulation. - Oh, routinely.\n- [Lex] That's heartbreaking. - People weaponize children all the time, and they do it with the\npermission of their own conscience because they genuinely believe I'm gonna protect this person, this child from this person\nwho by the way is a bad spouse. But that doesn't mean they were\na bad father or bad mother. You can be bad at being a spouse, but the skillset of a\nspouse and of a parent, it's not necessarily the same. And I've seen people, people alienate children from\na parent in such subtle ways, but they're so powerful. And as a lawyer, it\ndoesn't matter what I know. It matters what I can prove. And it's very hard to prove alienation because it's usually\na very subtle process. And the example I always give to people is it's a rare kind of crazy\nperson that will say to a seven year old, \"Your\ndad is a bad person,\" but this, \"Hello. Here, it's your dad.\" You just said your dad is a bad person. You just did it with your eyes. You did it with your, the expression on your face\nwhen you handed the phone to the kid, you told that\nkid your dad is a bad person. You didn't have to say it out loud. And that is something people\nare guilty of all the time. When the kid comes home and says, these are a divorced couple. Kid comes home and says, \"Oh,\nI met mom's new boyfriend.\" And you go, \"Oh yeah, that's nice. Remember he is not your dad.\" You know, like what, whoa. Like you just told that kid\na whole bunch of information about how he's supposed\nto feel about this person. - [Lex] Yeah. - Whereas if you go, that's nice. Is he nice, oh, that's great. I heard nice things. Yeah, I heard he is\nreally, he likes bicycles. That's cool. That's really neat. Like you just told this kid, okay, it's okay, you could like this person. It's okay to like this person. It's okay that your mom\nis with this person. And again, whatever\nyou feel about your ex, your co-parent, usually you love your kid more than you hate your ex ideally. - Also, I wish people would, even without an apology,\nforgive each other. 'Cause it goes back to the\nearlier discussion we had. I usually forgive people if\nthere's something in them, especially if we shared something. But even just if there's something about them that's beautiful. It's great that they exist in the world. So I'm just grateful for that. And I use that as the fuel of forgiveness. - I dunno, to me, like forgiveness is\nvery often, it's for me. When I let go of anger, I feel lighter. I think my heart enjoys peace. I mean partly, it's 'cause\nI fight for a living. I work in the world of conflict. I jokingly used to say to my\nsons when they were teenagers, I can only argue if you've paid, (Lex chuckles) it's not fair to the paying customers. If I argue with you for free- - [Lex] That's a good line. - That's not fair.\n- Yeah. (laughs) But I think we're talking about the incredibly wide range\nthat a divorce can cost. - [James] Yeah. - And you were saying the\ncheapest one was the yellow paper? - Yeah, yellow pad. Two people came to an\nagreement, write it up, make it legally binding\nfive grand, maybe tops. But usually 3,500, five\ngrand, that kind of vibe. Most expensive, millions,\nmillions of in council fees. - [Lex] And that's because of\nthe duration, the complexity? - Yeah, the duration,\nthe complexity of issues. Like I have clients who paid two, three million\nin counsel fees to me. - So it's like, has to do custody or like what's the complexity? - It can be complex custody\nthat requires a hearing, that requires expert testimony, dueling mental health professionals opining on the parenting. It can be a situation where\nemergency circumstances occur, like where an individual tries\nto abscond to another country with the children and you\nhave to bring them back under the Hague Convention.\n- [Lex] Oh, wow. - On international child abduction. - [Lex] Oh, wow. - Yeah, we've done some Hague cases. There are cases where people have very different facts. Like before I came here today, a client of mine's soon to be ex-husband who she's in the middle of a door. He tested positive for cocaine\non a hair follicle test where it was said he was definitely not going to test positive\nand he tested positive. So it was like we were\nscurrying now with, okay, we gotta get a motion filed. We gotta suspend access. We gotta protect the kids. We gotta get in front of a judge. We gotta think about what\nare the implications of this, 'cause he was about to transition to an unsupervised parenting. Like this is the kind\nof stuff that can amp up the amount of work the lawyer has to do, which then translates to money. I mean, I get paid for my time, and the time of my team, I have attorneys and\nparalegals who work for me. When you have a team of\nlawyers working on a case, you can burn tens of\nthousands of dollars a day if it's a big enough case. There are also very\ncomplex financial cases. People move and hide money, high net, the high net worth space\nis a different world. If an average person owns a home, they own a home in their name or their name with their spouse. A high net worth person owns\nan LLC that owns that home. That LLC is owned by a trust. They are a beneficial,\ninterested party in that trust. Like this is how some of my clients who make tens if not hundreds\nof millions of dollars a year, pay less in taxes than\na cop or a firefighter, because they have structures and the structures that were designed for tax planning purposes\nthen in a divorce become very tricky to\nunwind and to figure out, wait, no, what is mine and what is not? - Well, then that takes us\nto the question of prenups. What's your view on prenups,\nprenuptial agreements? - It's not popular to\nquote Kanye West but, \"If you ain't no chump,\nholla we want prenup. We want prenup.\" I mean, that's what he had to say. - Meaning so that's, prenup is a good idea. - Prenup is an excellent idea. A prenup is a contract between two people that binds their respective rights and obligations in the event of a divorce when it comes to financial issues. That's all it is. There's a lot of reasons to have them and there really aren't any\nreasons not to have them, other than the fact it requires an uncomfortable conversation. - So I mean, there's a few questions here. First, do they work legally in general? - Yes, yes. If they are crafted correctly, which is not that hard\nto do for a lawyer to do. I'm saying for a lawyer to\ndo 'cause with the internet, everybody thinks why would\nI spend a thousand dollars, I can just Google prenuptial\nagreement and I can get one, and then it'll be, that is a bad idea. It is like a will, like if you're gonna have a\ndocument that binds your rights at that level, it's worth, the most expensive prenup I've ever done was like three grand. That's ridiculous. That's not a lot of money. So there's no reason you wouldn't do it. But people still, people will still, I've had clients that have\nhundreds of thousands of dollars and they did their prenup\ndownloading something from the internet and\nbecause of some imperfection. It doesn't have the right\nwhat's called acknowledgement, which is the section\nwhere the notary signs, and it has to say that it was duly sworn before this person on this date. And if it doesn't have that, it's invalid. It's not binding. So there are weird technicalities, but yeah, prenups are binding as long as there's been some\nminimal asset disclosure, which is easily done in a prenup. And as long as there's\nnot a language deficiency, meaning that the person who\nis reading it understands English to the level that they understand what they're signing. And if they don't, that at\nleast they've acknowledged in their native language that\nthere is some opportunity for this to be translated for them. Yeah, they're binding. They're presumptively binding. We live thankfully in a culture where people are allowed to enter into contracts about money. - What are some prenups that you've seen that can be effective or what that people converge towards in terms of what does\nthat agreement look like? Because the popular conception\nis when there's no prenup, both sides get half. - And that's generally true, that both sides get half, equitable distribution, which\nis what the law is called. It's the law of equitable distribution. It's not called the law of\nequal distribution for a reason, because it's equitable, not equal. Now equal, like equitable\nis presumed to be equal, but there are exceptions\nto that presumption. And that's where lawyers can get into fun and or trouble depending\non how you view it. It's where we make our money. We make our money arguing\nthat the fair result will not be just a 50/50 split. And so there's the very\ngeneric standard prenup, which is easy. I call that yours, mine, and ours. If it's in your name, it's yours, whether it's an asset or liability, my name, it's mine, joint names, we split at 50/50. Simple, clean. And you go in to the marriage now knowing what the rules are. So if you get a bonus at work and you put it in your sole name, then it's your separate property\nin the event you divorce. You go out and buy a boat and she doesn't support\nyou buying the boat, but the boat, you got a\nbig loan on this boat, you're responsible for that loan. So I like that because I like\npeople having some control. And I also like people\nhaving to have discussions. Well, why are we putting that bonus just in your bank account? Why wouldn't we put it in\nthe joint bank account? We should have that discussion\nwhile we're married, not when we're in a divorce\nlawyer's office 10 years later, because we should be able to talk about those kinds of things. So what's interesting\nabout prenups is that, that somehow people think\nthere's something like, it takes away from the\nromance of a marriage. But I've said it before\nand I'll say it again, all marriages end. They end in death or divorce. So having life insurance or having a will, it doesn't mean you can't wait to die. It doesn't mean you're\nlooking forward to death. It doesn't mean that you're predicting, your demise sometime imminently. It just means that, you're\nbeing realistic and honest. So when you marry, and I don't\nmean spiritually marrying, having a marriage ceremony. I mean, legally marrying. You're making changes to your rights and obligations under law. That's what you're doing. Like marriage, from a legal standpoint, what we mean when we say I got married is a state agency. It's been created by the state. Like this is a legal status that most people who are\nin it know nothing about. They just did the most\nlegally significant thing they're ever going to do other than dying. And they have no idea what rights and obligations it created in them. And the first time they're\ngonna get an education about it is in my office. That's crazy. - When they get divorced. - That's crazy. And so prenup is an opportunity to learn something about it at the start. - So first of all, whenever someone\napproaches me about prenups and that's like four or\nfive times a week probably, depending on the season. Right before wedding season, we get a lot. - When is wedding season? - Well, it used to just be the summer, they say when you marry in June, you're a bride all your life. That's from some Rodgers\nand Hammerstein's music. Now the fall is very big too. People love fall content, fall weddings, pretty, you know, pictures and things. - Content.\n- [James] Yeah, fall content. - It's good on gram. - [James] Hashtag full content. - All right. - [James] It's all for the gram. - The hashtag.\n- Weddings is for the gram. I have to tell you, weddings\nis performative, man. See, the problem is though, it's curated. So you'd say, here's us picking the cake. It's not, here's us doing the prenup. You know how many people\nI've done prenups for that I've watched on their social media or them being interviewed\nby Andy Cohen on Bravo and saying, \"Well, no,\nwe don't have a prenup.\" Yeah, you do, yeah, you do. You do, it's in my office. It's in a folder.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - They have prenup. - They don't even know, that's beautiful. - But prenups are not published any place. They're not filed with a court. They're maintained by the\ntwo people that signed it, and they're lawyers, that's it. So nobody has to admit\nthat they have a prenup. - Beautiful. - But there's a, yes, but there's a certain\nproblem with that insofar as, a lot of people have prenups and we need to normalize prenups. Like there's no reason\nnot to normalize prenups. There's no reason not for, until some famous people\nsay, \"Yeah, we have a prenup. We're crazy about each other. That's why we're getting married.\" But yeah, look, we're getting, you know, I don't wanna get a car\naccident, but I got a seatbelt. You know, like you have it just in case. - And I mean, what do you do\nif you're running a company? What does that have to do with a prenup? You're running a hundred billion dollar or trillion dollar company, Jeff Bezos, I suppose his marriage was before Amazon. - [James] Yeah, his was\nbefore it was anything. - But like, how does\nthat work in a prenup? - Well, no, actually, it's the same. I mean, what you're doing with a prenup is you're identifying how\nthings will be classified in advance. So you're creating a set of rules and then you both can function under those rules during the marriage. So for a brief time, I taught a family law drafting\nclass at a law school. And when we would do separation agreements and we would do pleadings,\nit was lots of fun. When we would do prenups, I\nwould say to the students, \"What's the main thing you need\nwhen you're doing a prenup?\" And they would say, \"Well,\nyou need asset disclosure.\" And I'd say, \"Well, that's\nnot the main thing.\" And they'd say, \"Well, you\nneed, technical language.\" They say, \"Nope.\" Main thing you need is a crystal ball. The main thing you need\nis the ability to see what's gonna happen in the future. Who's gonna have money, who's not, who's gonna be successful who isn't, what people will inherit? Problem is we don't have that. We don't have that. So what can we do? We can create tranches, we can create structures, we can create systems, and then people can\nlive with those in mind. You enter the game\nknowing the rules, right? So you know if this is gonna\nbe a submission only event, you know if this is\ngonna be no time limit, you know if we're after a\ncertain number of minutes, we're going into points now, okay? So I can work with that rule set and I'm gonna amend my game\nbased on that rule set. Same thing. Same thing. You're just gonna say,\nlook, what's the rule set? Let's agree on the rule set, and then let's conduct ourselves\nwith the rule set in mind. Let's plan with the rule set in mind. And I think that, and by the way, and if you're gonna cheat, you cheat with the rule set in mind, you know you're cheating, right? You know you're trying to\nget around the rule set. So prenups are, when I do\na consult for a prenup, the first thing I do is, here's what's gonna happen legally if you marry without a prenup. Here's what happens to your\nrights and obligations, then what we can change with that. There's almost no limit. You can amend anything you want to. The example I always give is, there was a case that went\nup to the appellate court where a high net worth guy\nmarried a very beautiful woman. And there was a provision\nin the prenuptial agreement that said, for every 10 pounds she gained during the marriage, she would lose $10,000 a month\nin alimony if they divorced. Here's her baseline weight as of the time of execution\nof this agreement. And I wondered if she was, like did like what a wrestler does? Like did she like, you know- - [Lex] Yeah. - Did she like bulk up up right before and then cut when she\neventually got divorced? Like is she in there\nsauna, with the suit on. And the appellate essentially said, I don't know why you married this person, having had them make you\nsign this, but it's binding. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- But it's binding. - I wish somebody would\ndo a contract like that, like the rent for this place\nwould be more expensive if I was fatter, and\ncheaper if I was skinnier. And that way I would have to weigh in- - [James] And be weigh in on it. - Like a motivation. - [James] Like some motivation on you. - Yeah, exactly. That kind of prenup is motivating for me. - What his name? I think Tim Ferris says\nthat about how he does like, he said, \"You should\nmake bets with people.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - Like it's like, if you gain this much, I gotta give you this amount of money. I think he says that in\none of his early books. - [Lex] And trying to\nmake a binding somehow, which is tough.\n- Yeah, yeah. I think when we create\nincentives of that kind, that's why like there was\nlike the no nut November or no shave November,\nsober, like all those- - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It was a competition. When people make a\ncompetition of something, they gamify something. It makes it something that people are more likely to stick with. I mean I guess a prenup\nwould be interesting. The problem is there, there's also people put in prenups what's called fidelity clauses. - [Lex] Uh-oh.\n- Yeah, yeah. - [Lex] Yeah. - Fidelity clauses, people still do these. I discourage people from doing them there. The two things that people put in prenups that I discourage people\nfrom putting in prenups, but very often people\nstill put in prenups, even with my caveat is fidelity\nclauses and sunset clauses. So fidelity clauses is,\nI'm waiving alimony, I'm waiving this, I'm waiving that, but if you cheat, I get a million bucks or I get this much alimony,\nor I get this amount. And I know the intention is to disincentivize the\nperson from cheating. It's a deterrent to have them cheat. But all it really does is just creates like an interesting\nlegal battle for lawyers. Like how did you prove\nthat they cheated or not? - Oh, right, 'cause what, yeah, what constitutes cheating also. - Right, right, is an emotional affair, and affair is oral sex, cheating\nis, you know, like what, what is, and by the way,\nhow do you prove it? - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, I was in a hotel with her, but how do you prove\nthat I had sex with her? And it's very, very, you're opening a can of worms\nwith that kind of a thing. But people sometimes still put them in. And sunset clauses. Sunset clauses is if we're\nmarried X period of time, this goes away as if it never existed. - And why is that a bad idea? - The same reason the\ncommunity property law in California is a bad idea. So the community property law is after a certain number of\nyears, I think it's seven. Everything including\nyour premarital property all becomes marital property. And the idea of that was supposed to be that if you've been married\nthat number of years, like you're in enough of\na serious relationship now that everything is one\nunit, you're one person. What it actually does is\ncreates a very uncomfortable thought experiment that\npeople have to have at the six year mark. Because now the honeymoon's kind of over, you might have a kid or two and\nyou go, okay, wait a minute. Am I so happy in this\nrelationship that I'm willing to take all of my premarital assets and throw them in the pot right now? 'Cause if not, I got six\nmonths to get divorced. - [Lex] Yeah. - And that's not, so like\nif you say to someone, if you got married tomorrow\nand then you found a company that's worth a $100 dollars\nand under your prenup, that's your separate property. But there's a sunset clause that says that your prenup goes\nout the window in 15 years. Man, at year 14 and six months. You gotta ask yourself\nsome serious questions about where's this relationship\ngonna be in five, 10 years. - That's brilliant. And that's why kids, you pay for a lawyer. - That's it. We get paid to see around corners. I get paid to be paranoid. I tell people that all the time. - Okay, so you mentioned infidelity. You write in the book,\nwhich everybody should get. It's a great book. It's a great read. It's a window into your soul. You in this book, right? That there's five kinds of infidelity. Do you remember, can you explain? - Yeah, I mean, what I wanted to say is that\nall infidelity is not the same. That there's different kinds. And some of them are\nmore obvious than others. There's the soulmate. That's the one I think I see most often, which is a person meets another person or rekindles on social media or elsewhere. A reconnection with another\nperson in their life. And they go, oh my God, this is the person I'm\nsupposed to be with. I'm in love. The heart wants what the heart wants. I'm leaving you for this person, 'cause I have found my true love. That's one type. And it's an incredibly common type. And there's a, you know, there are plenty of cautionary\ntales associated with that where people thought that\nthey found their someone and then it turns out it was, you know, no, it was just unfair. A man who leaves his wife for his mistress just leaves a new job opportunity open. - And we should also mention that you, you know, talk about\nFacebook and Instagram. - Oh, yes. If we were going to invent a\ninfidelity generating machine, it would be called Facebook. Which by the way is a function of the fact the book was written in 2019. I would now change it to Instagram. - Oh, 'cause you said just Facebook. - Yes. But now if I had to\nrewrite it, it would be, if we were gonna invent an\ninfidelity generating machine, it would be called meta, that would be what would happen there. - Yeah, there you go.\n- [James] Yeah, yeah. - Very tech forward. - It's was a function of what Facebook and I think Instagram also are, which is, it is a communication tool that has people looking into windows that I think are antagonistic to marriage. You're looking into the\nlives of other people. You're looking into the social lives of people\nthat you meet casually. So there was a time where you would be at your son's soccer practice and see the attractive mom across the way. And you wouldn't really talk\nto her, interact with her, if you did, it would just be at practice. But now we add on social\nmedia, those people, because for legitimate reasons, we need to maybe communicate\nabout one practices or we wanna message the person. But now it's sort of an\ninvitation to a connection. And then it, you know, there's a picture of her\non vacation in a bikini, that's very intriguing. And then you have a benign, oh, I saw you guys on a vacation. Where did you stay? You know, oh, was it good? Did you like that? Oh, that's nice. And now we're talking and now\nwe're having an interaction. And now this is how the\nspark of affairs begins. It's usually people don't\nusually meet and go, would you like to potentially\nwreck your marriage? Yes, would you? Oh my God, let's do this.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - It's much more, you\nknow, it's slowly happens. So when I talk about types of infidelity, the soulmate, the unexpected soulmate. This connection that you didn't expect. I didn't expect to fall in love\nwith this person, but I did. And the heart wants what the heart wants. And I'm sorry. That one's tough. That one's tough because it's an interesting distinction between men and women to some degree, that when a man finds out\nhis wife was cheating, the question is, did you fuck him? And when a woman finds\nout that a man cheated, the question is, do you love her? And those are different things. - I feel like there could be many and have been many books written on that. - Yeah, there have-\n- Distinction. - By much smarter people than me. - [Lex] Yeah. - I think that the soulmate thing is very, very painful for\na lot of my female clients when a man says, \"Listen, I found the one, I found the one and it's not you.\" That is really, really hard to get past. Even when it turned out to be true. I mean, I've seen some\npeople that, you know, it was an affair that turned\ninto 20 plus year marriages. So an unhappy marriage\nand then a happy affair that turned into a very happy marriage. I've not seen, there's\nnot a formula, you know, like I've been doing it long enough now that I've seen permutations\nI never would've expected. So that's one type of infidelity. The other is what I call\nthe push outta the closet, which is, and that I think happened more\noften earlier in my career, there have been tremendous strides, I think in the lesbian\nand gay community where, including marriage equality, obviously, where there's a lot of change as to people accepting people\nas being gay or lesbian. And I think that there was a time where people were having, being in the closet was\nmuch more important. You were subject to professional scorn and all kinds of things if\nyou were gay or lesbian. So people were sneaking around and having affairs with\ntheir same-sex partners, and then they get caught. And then it really was a function of the fact that they were closeted. And again, that's another\nkind of complicated dynamic because I haven't had that happen to me where a woman left me for a woman, but I'd like to think it\nwould be easier for me. - [Lex] Yeah. - Because if you left me for a man, you're saying I want one like\nyou, but better than you, whereas if you leave me for a woman, well, that's a whole\ndifferent set of equipment. I don't have that.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - So I can't, like, okay. It's not me, it's you. It's something you want\nthat I can't offer. We don't serve that at this restaurant, so it's okay.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I get it. I mean, there's a betrayal,\nthere's a sadness, whatever. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - But, you know, it's a different thing. The saddest type of\ninfidelity in my opinion, is the mistake, which is\nsomeone just makes a mistake. People do dumbest shit\nwhen it comes to sex. - [Lex] Yeah. - People just in a moment, you know, they follow temptation. Their impulse control is poor, and they do something that they, that doesn't reflect their morality or doesn't reflect the\ndepth of their feelings. If you spent enough time\nin a room with people who've cheated in a relationship and are speaking candidly to you about it, 'cause you're their lawyer. They'll say to you very openly, like, no, I really love my wife. Like, I really love my wife. I just, I don't know, I was just an idiot. Like, I just, you know, I saw this bright shiny\nobject and I went for it. I really wanted to sleep with that woman. I wanted to fuck her. I love my wife. I make love to my wife, I love my wife, but I just wanna sleep with this one. And we created a culture where one of those eradicates, the other. That's a whole nother discussion is, or is there ethical non-monogamy? Like should we, is marriage\nabout who I have sex with? Or is marriage a different\nkind of a partnership? Is it a pair bond that's about\nbuilding a life together? And where does monogamy fit into that? And people like Esther\nPerel, those are people who are making very intelligent\ndiscussions about that. - Yeah, that's a complicated one. Just to actually just linger on that. How often have people with open marriages have been in your office? - Well, let's see. And this is one of those like\nfrom a research perspective, this would be flawed. Because I see the, they're in my office 'cause\ntheir marriage is falling apart. - [Lex] Yeah. - So there may be lots of\npeople having open relationships that don't end up in a\ndivorce lawyer's office. So I'd never meet them.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - But I meet a lot of people that, that was the Hail Mary pass.\n- [Lex] Sure. - Like I meet a lot of\npeople that they tried that, but in retrospect, it\nwas a Hail Mary pass. It was like, look, we've\njust figured let's try this. Maybe this'll keep the glue\ntogether on this thing. And I've also seen open\nrelationships go wrong, where we agree we're just\ngonna have sexual connections with other people, or we're gonna bring other\npeople into the bedroom, but together, lik we're gonna be\ntogether with other people or with another person. And then that connection\nof those two people like, you think it's a soulmate\nall of a sudden now. And it goes in this other because, and again, is that novelty, is that like it's the reason\nwhy I don't understand why people have the threesomes. It's kind of like when\nsomeone sings to you, I don't know where to look. I don't know where to look. If someone's singing to me.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I don't know where to look. Like it feels weird, right?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - This is a conundrum.\n(Lex laughs) No this, (laughs) I'll say this to you, this will never-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - But it's the reason I\ncan't go to strip clubs. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I dunno where to look. Like if I go to strip club, like you go to strip club\nand there's the part where the woman is on the stage and\nshe walks past each person who does a little thing\nand the next person and then next little thing. So when she's right in front\nof you, I like a woman's face. And I like a woman's body. I like both of them. So I'm looking at the woman's\nface and she's very beautiful, but she's naked and I\nthink, oh, she's naked. I should be looking at her naked body because obviously that's like, it's almost rude not to because\nshe's naked in front of me. Well, of course. So then I'm looking at her naked body, which is lovely to look at. But then I find myself going, oh my God, you're just still like, you should look at her\nface for God's sakes. - Yeah. - And then I look at her face and find myself having\nthis whole thing in my head where I'm going like, oh my God, where am I supposed to look? So I think a threesome with two women, you don't hardly know or you're\nnot an, that's different. But a threesome with a long-term partner who you're in a relationship with and a new person seems to\nme a very dangerous ground because you're gonna wanna enjoy the novelty of this new person, but you're gonna have to spend\ntime with this person after. So how much attention do\nyou spend to the new novel, exciting thing without\ncreating the impression that you don't, you're\nnot interested in this 'cause you're my favorite person, but this is fun so I wanna\njust try this for a few. But then also I don't\nwanna forget about this. It just seems tricky. - That analogy by the way, is brilliant. And also I guess it's tricky because the consequences\nof mistakes are quite high, 'cause you're gonna have to talk about it. - Right, and there's an easy way to\nmisinterpret the data, right? If I really like sleeping with my partner, but I get one chance to\nsleep with this other person, well, of course, I should indulge in that because I can do this\nanytime, what did, you know. But this person, my partner\nmight interpret that as, oh, so you're more\ninterested in her than me. Because that voice in my\npartner, that would be, you know, insecure might hear that. So just why would you even, why would you open yourself\nup to that level of chaos? - You seem to love\nchess in the courtrooms. It's the kind of intimate\nhuman chess of sorts. - Yeah, no, that's too high risk. - How do we get on threesomes? Oh, open open marriages. - Well, how do we get on threesomes? I don't know. I always wonder how\npeople get in threesomes. I figure if they like if one\nis fun, two must be better. If two is better, three must be better. Yeah, I think the way that\nthis becomes an issue is why would you have a\nnon-monogamous relationship? What is it about your\nsex life with this person that's not satisfying? And I think that that is the question that's harder to ask yourself and to try to answer with your partner. - I mean, you've said that\nthis idea of soulmates- - [James] Great business. - Is great for your business, but so like a human being in a partnership can't be everything, is that true? - I think it's unrealistic. - [Lex] \"True Romance,\" right? The document of that we\nkeep referencing here. - I think it's wonderful that we do, 'cause sometimes now people don't get that reference anymore. Like I talk to people in, when I try to teach\nnegotiation to young lawyers who come work for me, I tell them to watch the Gary Oldman scene where he offers them the Chinese food. - Yeah, why is that scene\nthe one that really? - Because it's the best negotiating lesson I've ever heard in my life. Where he comes in he's- - Just for the record.\n- Yeah. Gary Oldman plays a pimp.\n- [Lex] Yes. - And he owns, his girl is\nPatricia Arquette, right? And Christian Slater's character. The protagonist is coming\nin to tell Gary Oldman that he no longer owns this girl. Alabama is her name.\n- [Lex] Alabama. - Alabama is gonna be with him now. And Gary Oldman is amazing performance. And he's sitting in a living room with a shotgun next to him, with armed guys around him, watching television and\neating Chinese food. And he's got Chinese food\nlaid out in front of him. And Christian Slater comes in and he says, \"I need talk to you about Alabama.\" And Gary Oldman says, \"Do\nyou want some Chinese food?\" And Christian Slater sort of\ntaken aback by the question. He says, \"No, I came\nto talk about Alabama, she's with me now.\" And he proceeds to tell him\nwhat his offer essentially is. And Gary Oman says, \" You\nknow, you fucked up, right?\" And some and substance he says, you know, if you'd sat down and started\neating my Chinese food, I would've thought, who's this guy? He didn't have a care in the world just sitting down eating my Egg Foo Young. But instead you tried to be hard. And now I know you're full of shit. And so I think that scene\nsummarizes how in negotiation, the more you enter into it with that, anytime I deal with another\nlawyer and they're like, well, we'll see you in court. Okay, we'll see you in court. Like empty barrels make the most noise. Like you and I as people who've been in the\njiu-jitsu community or been, I know some dangerous people. I know FBI swat people, I know, you know, I know people that are, they know how to do things to people. And they're the calmest guys\nyou ever meet in your life. - [Lex] Yeah. - You scuff their sneaker. Oh yeah, don't worry about man, it's okay. They're quick to apology. They're just chill. - What were we talking about? - We were talking about- - Oh, wait, \"True Romance.\" Oh, the soulmate. - Yeah, soulmate. Yeah, well, you're saying\nthat this idea like with that film underlying, there's this current of like, they were made for each other. - [Lex] Yeah. - I think there's a\ndistinction between the feeling that someone is your missing puzzle piece that you're made for this person. I think what that just means is there's a lot of overlapping,\nbeautiful connections. I love them intellectually. I love them sexually. I love them interpersonally. We have some shared history. We have some shared commonalities. We were raised in the same culture, raised in the same religion. We have politically similar ideas. Like these are all, or we have totally opposite\nones, but they're complimentary. I've always joked that\nlike finding someone with complimentary pathologies, like I'm obsessively disciplined. So having a partner who's like flexible and like spontaneous\nis really good for me. And also me being like, no,\nno, no, come on, come back. We're gonna do this now. No, no, it's time to actually do this now. We're good for each other. It's barefoot in the park. It's this idea of like\nthe yin and the yang. So what I have an issue\nwith is that the definition of soulmate that I think is\nsold to so many people now is this idea that if your partner is disappointing to you in any way, meaning they're not the\nperfect travel companion, they're not the perfect\nvocabulary companion, they're not the perfect roommate, they're not the perfect\nlover, they're not the, like the odds of someone\nbeing all of those seems crazy to me. It's infinitesimally small and they don't have to be everything. If I go to a restaurant and eat 10 courses and one of them is kind of subpar and the other nine are the most amazing culinary\nexperience I've ever had. How dare I say, well, that wasn't the right restaurant. What do you mean? Like, that's a great restaurant. What are you talking about? Of course, there was one little thing. So I think it's impossible to have someone never disappoint you. It's impossible to have\nsomeone who never lets you down or doesn't say and do\nthe exact right thing at the exact right time. And to create the idea\nor expectation in anyone that your partner should\nnever let you down, never disappoint. You never not know what to say. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Is I think crazy. I mean, I find for myself, when someone, for example, loses someone, when someone loses a\nfamily member or a pet. I often say the same thing to the person. I'll either talk to them or\nsend them a text or call 'em. And I'll say, \"If I wish I\nknew the perfect thing to say because I would say it right now.\" But I know there isn't. I know that, you know,\nI don't say that part, but I know there isn't. There isn't a perfect thing to say. But if there was a perfect thing to say, I would say it right now. Love to me is not that you\nnever let this person down. It's that you never wanna\nlet this person down. It's love is a verb. It's this feeling of, I never want to disappoint you. I will disappoint you, but I\nnever want to disappoint you. I will hurt you, but I\nnever want to hurt you. When I hurt you, it will be\nmy insecurity, my stupidity, my humanity that causes me to hurt you. But I will never intentionally hurt you. I will betray your trust. I'll never intentionally\nbetray your trust. I will bite my stupidity\nsay the wrong thing or loose slip say something to someone that you didn't want me to,\nbut it won't be intentional. I'll always try to be on your team. That feels to me like a realistic thing. - Yeah, the intention leads the way, but there's some aspect of like, just the turn course meal, that over time, there's a kind of a\nconvergence towards perfection. And along the way there's\nthe rose-colored glasses where you see the beauty and everything. So it just, it feels, it's probably destructive\njust to really internalize the idea of soulmate. Because then any imperfections\ncan make you doubt, can make you step away, can make you lose the connection. But it just feels like, I don't know. - It's too heavy. It just feels, I feel like when you see a\ncouple that's 90 years old and they've been together\nfor 60 years, 70 years, there is of course a temptation to think about all the beauty that they've seen on\nthat journey together. The children, the grandchildren, maybe the great-grandchildren, all the joy that they've seen, all the pain they've endured\nand struggled together, but they've also disappointed each other a whole bunch of times. Probably let each other down. They probably lied to each other a bunch. - [Lex] Yeah. - And yeah, and to me\nthat is a beautiful thing. Like that's what, that that is not, it's great in spite of that, it's great because of that.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - They still love each other, even though they've been\nso flawed and imperfect, and they're human and they\nstill love each other. They still rode that thing together because the reasons to do so, were greater than the reasons to not. - We've mentioned some of this, but I'd love to get your opinion on having seen things gone wrong, and having mentioned Amber\nHeard and Johnny Depp, how much fighting do you think\nis okay in a relationship and how to resolve the fights such that they don't escalate to that disconnection? Is there some wisdom you have for that? I imagine you've seen some epic fights. - Yeah.\n(Lex laughs) I've seen some crazy fights. I have, even on my phone,\nI have some recordings, 'cause now there's cameras everywhere. It's like nest cams and ring cams. And so a lot of this gets recorded, and people, you know, have\nphones so readily available that they can record and the\nother person didn't know it. And I listen to the way\npeople speak to their, first of all, I listen to the way people\nspeak to each other, and I'm shocked. I listen to the way people\nspeak to their romantic partner, to their spouse. And I'm blown away. I'm blown away. - [Lex] Disrespect or what? - Just disrespect, insults, profanity, just degradation, just\nbrutality, just, just, and then like to then kind\nof go on like the next day you kind of go on like nothing happened. I'm shocked by it. I mean, I listened to it and I think like if someone ever spoke to me that way, I don't know that I could ever really feel deep connection to them, like freely. I would feel so betrayed like that. They just so brutal.\n- [Lex] Right. - I can't imagine speaking\nto someone that way. Like saying just such\nvicious insults to someone. But I understand that's how\nsome people communicate perhaps. I guess the question of how much fighting is too much fighting in the relationship? Is for me, a bit like the question, how much sex is enough\nsex in the relationship? - [Lex] Yeah. - It depends on the two people\nand their individual tastes. But what's problematic is\nwhen there is a disconnect between the two people. - [Lex] Sure. There's a, I think it's Annie Hall, it's one of the Woody Allen films where Diane Keaton and\nWoody Allen are both talking to their respective therapists\nabout the relationship, but it's like a split screen.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And she says, I mean,\nwe have sex all the time. We have sex like once a week.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And he goes, we never have sex. We have sex like once a week. - [Lex] (laughs) Yeah. - And you know, it's\nfunny because it's true. It really is this, they both know the same data, but they're interpreting that data set completely differently. And I think it, you know, the question you have to\nstart asking is like what is, Steve Harvey actually once\nsaid something funny to me. He said that success is not where you are. Success is where you are in\nrelation to where you started. - [Lex] Yeah. - He says, 'cause if\nsuccess is where you are, Oprah's got a all beat.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Or maybe Elon's got us all beat. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I don't know. But if it's where you are\nversus where you started, 'cause there's a lot of\npeople that started on second and started on third act\nlike they hit a double. Like well, I was given 10 million, but then I turned it into a 100 million. Well, the first million's the hardest. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So, you know, come on. But I think the question of like, how much sex were we having at the beginning of the relationship, that might be the wrong gauge, 'cause that's like we couldn't\nkeep our hands off each other and we just, it's novelty. But, you know, like how far, how much sex we're having post children versus before the children,\nthat might be worth looking at. You know, like how do we compare it? Am I overweight compared to what? When I was 20 and running\nmarathons or most 50 year old men? I don't know, I gotta, what do you compare it to? So I think fighting, there are some people that\nI think they enjoy fighting, like they enjoy argument. I know people that enjoy political debate. I don't particularly\nenjoy political debate. Not that I'm not very interested\nin political concepts, economic concepts. I just, I argue for a living. So in my free time, I don't find argument that\nenjoyable when it's intense. I find discussion more interesting. - That's so interesting that you just keep the battle\nto that particular, to your main profession-\n- [James] Sure. - And everywhere else you want peace. - Well, did you ever,\nyou know, Bob Goldthwait Bobcat Goldthwait, the\ncomedian, very, very funny. And he had a whole second chapter as like a director and a writer. But he has this, you know, I saw an interview with\nhim once where he said, yeah, he says like, I'm a comedian. I've been a comedian a long time. People always come up\nto me and they're like, \"Oh, you're a comedian, do\nyou want to hear a joke?\" - [Lex] Yeah. - He's like, and all I can think is, oh yeah, that'd be a real fucking treat. - [Lex] Yeah. (laughs) - Like I haven't heard jokes\nall day, all night for years. That would be a real\nspecial occasion, yes. I get it, you know. - Yeah, and I mean a sadder story of, I've been reading quite a\nbit about Robin Williams and- - [James] Yeah. - His wife would talk about\nhow quiet and introspective and thoughtful and\nintellectual he was and- - [James] Right. - Not really that humorous\nin his private life. - But that may be a function of, that it is enjoyable\nto be the other thing. - Yeah. - One of the things I've\nalways thought was very funny in relationships, my own relationships is, most women I know who have a husband who doesn't wear a suit\nevery day for a living, when their husband gets dressed up, like they're going to\na wedding or something, they get like, oh my God,\nlook at him, you know, and I wear a suit every day, on the weekends I don't\nwanna wear like jeans and a black T-shirt, but the\nrest of the time I wear a suit. And I remember, I think this has been\ntrue in every relationship I've been in since I was a\nlawyer, including my ex-wife. It was always like, if I had on jeans and I wasn't shaven, it was like, look at you.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - It's like, are you kidding me? (Lex laughs) - I'm like really?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Whereas the suit, they\nwouldn't even notice. - [Lex] Yeah. - Wouldn't even notice the suit. - [Lex] Sometimes the other thing. - Well, that's what it is. It's the novelty of the other thing. So I think that if you're Robin Williams and you're like being shot out of a canon in terms of your performative style and your energy and explosive. Yeah, being quiet must be very refreshing. I imagine, you know,\nincredibly intelligent people must love just watching\nstupid humor or having a dumb, it's why some of the\nsmartest people I know, like really dumb shit.\n(Lex laughs) It's why like Rick and\nMorty I think is brilliant. - [Lex] Yeah. - Because it's both smart-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And dumb.\n- [Lex] Yeah. It's the perfect combination. - It really is, yeah. I think it's possibly the perfect show. - Is there advice you can\ngive to somebody like me on how to interview well, how to do conversations well? Do you think there's\nsomething transferable from the courtroom to this\nsetting with complicated people? - Yeah, I think so. I think what can be\nlearned about interviewing is the distillation. What is most important? When I hear a story that I\nhave to present to a judge, the totality of someone's parenting, the good of their parenting,\nthe bad of their parenting, the good of the other parent,\nthe bad of the other parent. I have to sort of boil down\nwhat are the best examples, 'cause I can't lay it all out. And then what greater\nprinciple do they speak to? You know, the best jiu-jitsu teacher that I think I've had as Paul Shriner, and Paul doesn't just\nteach you techniques. He's teaching you ways of thinking about concepts in jiu-jitsu. And then here are some\ntechniques that illustrate that. John Danaher, from what I can see, does a lot of that as well. I think they're like soulmates\nin the jiu-jitsu world. - Yeah. And then there's that\nelement that you spoke to, which is maybe considering\nthe other side, right? - Well, always, always. - Devil's advocate kind of thing. - Yeah, I mean, straw man, steelman stuff. You do a lot of that. And I think all the best interviewers do. But yeah, I think it's\nreally, really important to think about, I have to know the other side's case much better than my own. I have to know what are their defenses, what are their strengths? I have to map out a strategy\nthat keeps those in mind. And that's hard because\nearly in my career, I would attribute to the\nother side an intelligence and strategy that sometimes\nwasn't applicable. I've learned, there's like the simplest\nexplanation is the accurate one. The Occam's razor, I think like sextons would be never attribute to strategy that which could be attributed\nto stupidity for laziness. - Yeah. - Because I have lots of\nadversaries that like, they'll not file a motion I\nthought they were gonna file. And I'll go, wait, why\ndidn't they file that? Like tactically what are\nthey thinking I'm gonna do? And what is that about? And I would go, well, if I didn't file it, why wouldn't I file? And the answer is like, they\njust didn't think to file it. Or like they were too lazy to draft it, or they went on vacation last week so that's why they didn't, and I'm driving myself crazy going, there's some tactical\nreason, there must be. So I think you have to look honestly and don't attribute to the\nother side your constitution, if I said that, I'd be\nsaying it sarcastically. If you said it, maybe you\nweren't saying it sarcastically. Like you have to think about the fact that we're unique human beings who express themselves differently. - And for you, the audience\nis usually the judge. - It's a judge.\n- Do you do jury? - No, we don't do jury trials. That's the interesting thing\nabout family law attorneys. Family law attorneys don't do jury trials. We do bench trials. We just persuade there's\nperson in a black robe. That's the only person I have to convince. - Does the person in the black\nrobe, do they have emotions? Are they human or are they very? - They are human. They are all too human. - Do they impose that humanity on you? Like do you feel it? - Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. Oh no, do you feel it? Like they're human.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - They're working their shit out. - [Lex] Okay. (chuckles) Their parents.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - They're husbands and wives.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And you're talking about\nstuff they deal with. - [Lex] Yeah. - I had a woman on the stand, an expert witness on the stand who was talking about the emotional and physical abuse that was\nperpetrated on a seven year old. And this person had\nwritten a bunch of reports that were in evidence in this trial around like day six or seven in the trial. And there's all of this\ninformation in the record about this verbal abuse and mental abuse and gaslighting and like\nreally intense stuff that this woman's doing\nto this seven year old. And the judge is like\nvaguely paying attention for most of the time. And at some point the person says, well, when a parent is\nabusing a child, da, da, and the judge just interrupts, she goes, well look, you know, do you think like if a\nperson spanks a child that that's abuse? She's like, well, I like\na person in general. And by the way, if my\nadversary asks that question, I could object, but I can't object when the judge asks the question. They get to rule on that objection. So I'm like, where's this going? She's like, well, no, I mean, spanking can be a form of abuse. She's like, right, but like, you know, are you saying like everybody who spanks and I'm sitting here going,\nwhat is going on in your house? - [Lex] Yeah. - What went on with your parents? 'Cause you're bringing\nsome stuff here that's not, this is not what you're supposed to be. This is not your role. But there are good judges and bad judges, and that's a big, big deal. - Well, I've noticed that\nnow I don't have kids, so I have a certain\nperspective on the world. I really wanna have a\nfamily and have kids. But I've noticed when I talk\nto people that have kids and gender matters also, like fathers with daughters and so on. It changes the landscape\nof the conversation. - [James] It sure does. - It's like you're no longer\nthis intellectual that's like, well, there's this and there's this. It's more like go fuck yourself. Anything that with kids.\n- [James] Yeah, yeah. - Can like burn it to the ground. I don't care.\n- [James] Yeah. - I don't care what the nuance is of the little intellectual thing. - Oh, you wanna learn about this, represent someone who's\naccused of child sexual abuse. I've had about a dozen of those cases where I've represented someone who's alleged to have perpetrated\nsexual abuse of a child. You are guilty until proven innocent. And let me tell you, as a lawyer, that is the toughest\ncases because you put sex and kids together and everyone loses their\ngod damn mind, immediately. There is a rush to judgment. There is a disregard for procedure. There is a confirmation bias. There's a desire to be a protector. And again, all motivated and\ninformed by really good things. The desire to protect the innocent. The desire to protect the vulnerable. But gang, no, like we have these, I like living in a world\nthat has due process. I like these rules.\n- [Lex] Right. - I like the rules of evidence. I like innocent until proven guilty. I like that. I'm not saying it's perfect. - It's such a I'm so torn on it because I also like living in a world where people are so emotionally invested in connection to other like- - Those two things aren't\nmutually exclusive. They shouldn't be. - I know, but if you dedicate\nyourself fully to the law, you might lose some of the humanity. - I don't think you have to. I have to tell you, I once\nactually went off on a DA, on a district attorney\nwho was very vehemently prosecuting a child sex abuse\ncase that I was involved in. And I remember, I came in, thankfully I came in\nvery early in the case. So the accusation was made\nand I came in right away, 'cause very often you get this case. There've been 15 interviews. This person's been interviewed by police, by child protective services. And it's like they've already, they're already so far down a hole they didn't even know they\ndug themselves into, you know. So I got in very early on\nand I just kept saying, she's like, \"Well, we're gonna do this. We're gonna do this, we're gonna,\" I was like, \"Wait,\nwait, wait, wait, wait.\" We should both want this\nto be fair, done properly. There's an expert, like a well-respected expert\nwho's a clinical psychologist who they're job is, they're\na validation expert. So their job is to interviewed a child. They record the interviews\nwith a hidden camera so that everyone can see. They didn't have suggestive questioning. There are very stringent\nstandards that they follow, to prevent like suggestive questioning or any of those kinds of things. And I was saying, \"Listen, no, no one should be interviewing this child other than this person who's\na neutral, qualified person.\" And I kept saying to the other side, like, wait, no, no, see, this is the problem. You wanna win, you're a\nlawyer, you wanna win, I wanna win too, right? But we wanna win fair. Like, that's like saying, you know, I'm going into a boxing\nmatch, I wanna win. So if the referee's looking to the side, I'm gonna kick the guy in the nuts. Okay, then you might've won,\nbut you didn't win boxing. You won some other thing. I wanna win a fair fight. I want to go in with\nthe rules set, the law, the rules of evidence. I don't want a judge who\ndoesn't understand evidence. I don't want an adversary\nwho plays it fast and loose with the rules. I wanna go in and win a fair fight. And that's when it comes our passion to protect the\ninnocent, to emotionally connect, to feel deeply about\nchildren and protecting them, I don't think that that's antagonistic to. We always treat dandruff with\ndecapitation in this culture. And I don't understand it. And that's what I like about the law. The law, there's rules, and there's rules about procedure. And so that's our job is\nto bring out the truth using the rules and the procedure. I love that job. - But still there's a human\nbeing and the judge, right? - That's the problem. - It seems like a really hard job. It's a because you have\nto be pay attention to the whole thing. - You have to pay attention\nto the whole thing. And everyone is trying to\npersuade you and lie to you. - [Lex] Yeah. - And everyone can keep\ntheir shit together in a court appearance most of the time. - [Lex] Yeah. - It takes a rare, kind of\ncrazy to blow up in a courtroom. So most of the time everybody\nlooks really put together and like, yeah, you gotta have\nan amazing bullshit detector. I'm not saying they don't\nhave a really hard job. They have a really hard job. They have a way harder job than I have. - What's their source of ground truth? Like how do they sharpen\nthe radar for bullshit? - I think that they're\nassessing credibility, which is what you call it in\nthe law is something that, I think you're supposed\nto develop it on the job. - Do you have the data of who\nwas lying in the end or not? - No, not really. Not really, I mean, you can\ntry to demonstrate a lack. What I always tell clients, and this is the art of advocacy, right? Is I want to use examples\nof misrepresentations to show that this person's a liar. I'm trying to extrapolate\nfrom the small, the large. I'm trying to say, here's\nthree times he lied, therefore he's a liar. When in fact, we know human beings don't\nreally work that way. But I've seen people submarine, just torpedo their entire case because they lied about some dumb shit, some dumb little thing. And I say to 'em, why would you lie? Why did you lie about that? I had a case where a person was accused of child sexual abuse. And on cross-examination they were asked, did you have an affair\nwith this babysitter? And they were like, no, no, no, no, no. And then it was shown through\ntext messages and things. They clearly had an affair\nwith the babysitter. And I said, \"Why did you lie?\" And they said, \"Well, I\ndidn't want that to come out.\" And I said, \"Right,\nbut now you're a liar.\" Did you molest your child? 'Cause if the answer to that is no, and now you destroyed your credibility 'cause you didn't wanna admit that you slept with an adult woman, by the way, it would've\nbeen good for your case. It would've been good for\nyour case for you to say, yeah, I slept with her 'cause I like sleeping with\nadult women, that's how I am. I don't sleep with\nchildren much less my own. You know, so why would you lie? And so that concept is\nincredibly important. And judges, theoretically, they have to make very tough calls. I feel like it's the most\nimpotent place to just sit there and dispassionately sort of\nlisten and rule on objections. I just would be so frustrated, 'cause I'd wanna get up and\nI had to do jury duty once. And it was like a\nhorrific experience for me because I'm sitting there and I'm- - You have no power, you're just- - Yeah, I'm just watching\nthese two lawyers. I'm like, why did you ask\nthat question that way? I would never have asked it that way. Why would you object? Like when you object, you\nbring more attention to it, what are you doing? I'm watching both of them. It's like watching, like a jiu-jitsu probably\nwouldn't feel like for like John Donaher to\nwatch two white belts spar. Why are you doing, wow, my\nGod, what are you doing? Why would you grab that? What are you thinking? And, you know, it's frustrating. It's frustrating to watch. And as a judge it must\njust be unbelievable. - So divorce lawyers\nsometimes get a bad rep. Is there a reason for this? - I mean, no one's ever happy to be spending time with a divorce lawyer. Like if you have a criminal lawyer, they're defending you against\nthe maelstrom of injustice and false allegations. They're protecting your freedom. And maybe you're acquitted\nand then you're like, oh, that person saved me, you know. You buy a house, you know that lawyer\nhelps you get the house, you know you're happy about\nthat, sign the paperwork. You do a will, like you help\nthey make you feel secure. At best, I'm a representative of a chapter in someone's life that\nwas very unpleasant. I have a friend who's a Julliard\ntrained classical pianist, and he was having a\nhumidification system installed in his home because his piano required a certain level of humidity and it was very expensive to install this humidification system. And we went out to dinner and\nthen we came back to his place and he said, \"Man, this is the most depressing\n$15,000 I've ever spent.\" And I said, \"Why?\" And he said, \"'Cause\nthere's nothing different. I spent $15,000 and I feel\nabsolutely nothing different. My piano does, but I don't.\" I don't have anything to show for it. You finish getting divorced, you don't really have\nanything to show for it. - Yeah, at best. - [James] Yeah.\n- At at best, it's the same. - It's one of the things I think that's interesting about divorce is in our increasingly\nperformative society. You can't pretend you\nmeant to get divorced. You can't. Like everything everybody does, well, I wrote that album for me. It didn't matter that it\nwas not gonna be popular. No, you wanted that album to be popular. Come on, you're lying, and that's fine, but you're lying. Oh, I think my haircut came out great. I wanted it to look this fucked up. No, you didn't. You didn't, you're lying. And that's fine because\nwe live in a society now where everybody's just, oh\nyes, I meant to do that. Okay, divorce. Nope, you got married. You break up in a relationship,\nnot a marriage, okay. Well, we were only gonna be\ntogether for a little while. It was never serious. We were just like we were having fun. That's all it was, it wasn't. We were never gonna be\na happily ever after. No, you got married, you got married guys, you got up there and you said forever. And it didn't go forever. So you can't bullshit anybody anymore. No, it didn't go the way\nyou thought it was gonna go, didn't go the way you signed on for. So now that, that's undeniable. Like what can we make it? What can we make it into? Like it can be beautiful, the Barnes burned down,\nnow I can see the moon. Let's make it something. And so for me, I think people look at a divorce lawyer and they just go, yeah. This is this horrible chapter and I associate you with it. Also too, listen, some\nof the things we do, it's difficult to simultaneously prevent and prepare for war.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - The things you do to\nprotect your clients sometimes look like acts of aggression, but really they're just\ntrying to shore up a defense. And so I get paid to be paranoid and I have to say to\nclients sometimes like, \"Well, are you sure that\nthey're not doing this?\" And then they go, \"Well, I don't know.\" And I go, \"Well, let me inquire.\" Did she accuse me of that? No, no, I'm not accusing you.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I'm just trying, we get a reputation divorce\nlawyers as amping up conflict, 'cause we get paid for\nthe conflict, right? It's like if you get paid by the bullet, you're gonna start a\nlot of gunfights, right? It doesn't really work that way with most good divorce lawyers. There are plenty of people\nthat are bad lawyers and they stoke up conflict\nbecause it jacks up fees. They usually don't do well. They don't build a successful career, 'cause you live and\ndie by your reputation. - [Lex] Yes, reputation is everything. - But good lawyers, like good experienced divorce lawyers. We do the whole, you know, Hey, listen, you're gonna\nsay this, I'm gonna say this, you're gonna do this, I'm gonna do this. This is what, let's skip it. We're gonna end up here. We got judge, blah, blah, blah. And you know what he's gonna do? He's gonna go right here. So why don't we just agree\nright now to X, Y, Z. Sounds good, we're done, we're good. - So you wanna minimize\nthe number of bullets. - It's like the two, it's\nlike Miyamoto Musashi. It's like the two swordsmen\nwho see each other and they just stand there at the edge and they see the whole\nfight in their minds and they know who won and\nwho lost and they walk away. (Lex laughs) We do a lot of that. We do a lot of, okay. It's like when you watch high level chess. - [Lex] Yeah. - And someone resigns and\nyou go, wait, what happened? He didn't wait and you go, no, no, the other guy won.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - It's 15 moves from now, but he won and the other guy sees it. So now we're done. - Can you speak to some\nrecent high profile divorces? Like the most recent I\nsaw is Kevin Costner. - Yeah, Kevin Costner is a\ngreat, I mean, I don't know him, I'm not involved in the case. - By the way, \"Yellowstone\"\nis just so great. - Oh, it's so good, right? - And I hope Matthew McConaughey, who I've gotten to know, I hope he's does one of these shows. \"Yellowstone\" or anything else. He's just born for the\nrole, frankly, but anyway. - Yeah. He'd be amazing in that. Yeah, your conversation\nwith him was a great one. The Kevin Costner divorce is interesting because Kevin Costner had\none of the most expensive from a distributive award perspective. He gave a huge payout to his first wife, and then this time, he had a prenup. So it's actually, it's a very public showing of the fact that once bitten, twice shy, like he had a very public\ndivorce that cost him a lot of assets in terms\nof the division of assets. And now it appears by\nall acknowledged reports that he had a prenuptial agreement that was well-crafted and enforceable. The argument now is over\nwhat is child support? What is spousal support? What's covered in the\nprenup and what isn't? - So it seems like the\nprenup worked, actually. - The prenup worked, and Kevin Costner's career, which has always been a steady career. I don't know that in the\nlike Hollywood stock market that people would've bet on \"Yellowstone.\" Like I don't, I think you would've said, Hey, the best years of that\nguy's career are behind him. How do you get better\nthan \"Dances with wolves,\" and \"Robin Hood\" and\nlike all these big, big, \"The Bodyguard.\"\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And then \"Yellowstone\" and it's like, holy cow, did he knock\nthat outta the park? And he's central to it. I mean, he knocked the skin off the ball. So I think that's why\nprenups are important. You don't know what\nyour career is gonna do. You don't know where it's gonna go. And so he saved himself a lot of money. He also has a great lawyer. He has Laura Wasser, Laura Wasser is LA, just a top professional, brilliant lawyer, even tempered, but\nintense in the courtroom and just a smart, smart human being. - The thing I liked just, you know, I haven't been following it, but I saw a few comments he's made and he like refused to comment negatively about his spouse and just- - That's smart. - But like, the way he said\nit, it wasn't lawyer advice. It's good lawyer advice probably, but he said it from the\nheart, which I always like, I like seeing that.\n- [James] Yeah. - Like where he refuses even the drama, even the public nature of it to- - [James] Yeah.\n- Throwing jabs or- - Well, Laura his lawyer is\nactually notorious for like, not speaking to the press\nabout cases in an extended way. And that's smart move. I don't speak about pending\ncases I'm involved in publicly, and I discourage my clients from doing so. I can't always stop them, but I discourage them from doing so. I don't think there's\nany good to come of it. There are lawyers who try things in the court of public opinion. I think there is a, to take it to the broader\nprinciple you just brought up, I think there is a lot of value in talking about your ex in a favorable way. I have to say, when I first\ngot divorced many years ago, I went out on a date with a young woman. It was one of my first\ndates as a divorced man. And she was a divorced woman\nand she's a beautiful woman. And we were having dinner\nand it was going quite well. And it was one of those\nthings where I was like, oh, I definitely wanna\nsee this girl again. And I said something about, \"Oh, there's gonna be\nthis thing at this museum, we should go.\" And she's like, \"Oh yeah,\nthat'd be a lot of fun.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, we should definitely, maybe we'll be next thing we do together.\" And she was like, \"Yeah,\nwe should go next weekend. The kids are with asshole so we can go.\" And I just, it was like, you could hear that record scratch like, I just went, \"Oh yeah,\nno, this isn't good.\" I'm not, you're referring\nto the father of your kids is the asshole. We're already, I'm walking\ninto something here that I don't know that I\nwant to be involved in. - Yeah. - Matthew McConaughey\nbefore he was married. If you look at his history, he dated some of the most\nbeautiful women in Hollywood in their prime. And none of them ever talked\nbad about him in the press. They all were like, \"Oh my\nGod, he is such a great guy. He's such a great guy.\" And I always wondered like how do you, he got outta all of those relationships without a scratch on him. And when you'd watch\nan interview with him, they would say like so, you\nknow, you dated Penelope Cruz, and he'd go, Penelope,\nthat's just a special lady. That's just a what a special lady. She's just a wonderful,\nwhat a wonderful woman. I was just so blessed to\nhave the time with her. What a beautiful, wonderful woman. And I would think to myself,\nI'm like you're a genius. Like he's a genius because like he'd never came off as petty.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Spiteful, bitter, any of that. He just came off as like just dignified, strong, smart, self-assured. And like, it left, you know, it left like, it left the viewer with\nthe impression that like, when he was looking off and basically, he's probably like just thinking about some wonderful time he had with her. And you think to yourself\nlike, God, that guy, like he just became cooler and cooler. - [Lex] Yeah. - Whereas if he got into like the whole, oh yeah, that was ugly\nand then this happened, and nobody wants to hear it. It's awful. - The funny thing about\nhim just having interacted with him a bunch, I\ndon't think he's in the, he's in the Rogan School\nof thought I think, that I don't see him ever having a fight. Now his parents were as he is spoken about a\nbunch, nonstop fighting. - [James] Right. - They got divorced and remarried and- - [James] Yeah.\n- Just insane. - [James] And they were volatile. - Yeah, very. And he seems maybe you kind of, it depend on swinging the other way. He just seems cool as\na cucumber like always. - Just lets it roll off. But, you know, even if it's internally. - [Lex] Yeah. - Not rolling off, there is value in just rising above it in your discourse. - That's true, yes, yes. - Like you lie to your children. People say this to me\nall the time, clients. They're like, you know, why did you tell your child\nthat dad had an affair? Well, I'm not gonna lie to my kids. Fuck you, yes, you are. You lie to your kids all the time. - [Lex] Yeah. - Mommy, are you gonna die someday? Yes, babe, I'm gonna die\nand daddy's gonna die. And then someday the Earth's\ngonna hurl into the sun and we're all gonna die. Sweet dreams. Like that's not, you lie\nto your kids all the time. What's wrong with me? We don't know what's wrong with you. We're gonna take you to the doctor and hopefully, it's nothing\nserious and you won't die. You lie to your kids all the time. You tell 'em that Santa Claus\nexists when he does whatever. So to say, I'm not gonna lie to my kids. You lie to your kids all the time. You don't like your husband, that's okay. You don't like your ex-husband,\nbut it's their father. So just grin, you know. Oh, daddy took me to meet\nhis new girlfriend, Kiki. Oh, that's nice. Did you guys have a good time? Good, oh, that's, yeah, and she helped me do my\nhair and she did my makeup. Listen, I'm sure that's\nburning you inside. - [Lex] Yeah. - But you go, oh, that's\ngreat, because why? You love your kids. - I mean, again, McConaughey\nhas a way bottom with that. He's like, he basically says never lie, but a little bullshit is okay. - [James] Sure, sure.\n(Lex laughs) Yeah. - I mean, I'm very like, Tom Waits has that song \"Lied to Me.\" You gotta lie to me, baby. Honesty is a funny thing. - But Tom Waits also believes\nthat God's way on business. - I think his words man. - And who are the ones\nthat we left in charge? Killers, thieves, and lawyers. That's a Tom Waits quote. - Well, it must be true then. - [James] Yeah. (laughs) - I don't know how many limbs I have, but I will give all of\nthem to talk to Tom. And he's a very private person. - I feel like he's the musical equivalent of Cormac McCarthy.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Even if you get the\ninterview, you're not, I don't think gonna get in there. - No, I don't think you want like, honestly, I don't think you want to. I think I've seen his public\ninterviews over the years with Letterman and I think he just, he is the poetry. - I would put Tom Waits, Cormac McCarthy, Maynard James Keenan, these\nare artists that like, I think they want the\nart to speak for itself. They would like to be lessened. They don't want you to, I remember early, early days of tool, he could not have been less\ninterested in the spotlight. - [Lex] Yeah. - To the point where I think it was almost to the detriment of the band early on. And there's no surprise\nthat those are three artists that I think are unbelievable and in a category of their own. And that you hear their performance. Like you can give me a page\nof a Cormac McCarthy novel and I'll know it's a\nCormac McCarthy novel. You can a few notes of\nMaynard James Keenan or Tom Wait's voice, you\nknow that that's them. - Yeah, as genius. Genius hides from the spotlight. But doesn't stop me from\nfeeling sad about it. But anyway.\n- Yeah, that does. I would like to hear that interview. - She's the girl that got away. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, I'm just standing\noutside of that girl's house with a blue box.\n- With a sign. Yeah, just playing in your\neyes with Peter Gabriel, yeah. - Yeah, anyway, what does it lie to me? This whole idea of honesty in\nrelationships is interesting. I mean, clerks with the blowjobs. - [James] Yeah. - I don't know how to phrase\nit eloquently, but like, there's stuff you should be honest about and there's stuff maybe you\ndon't need to be honest about. - So in the law, it is\nillegal to commit fraud. Fraud is a material\nmisrepresentation of fact. But the law specifically says you are permitted to engage\nin quote, \"mere puffery.\" - [Lex] Nice. - Puffery.\n- [Lex] puffery. - And that's the term that\nwas used for it, puffery. And puffery is when you\nare inflating something, you're being like hyperbolic. But people wouldn't necessarily think you're telling the truth, like that it's not, you know, like if I say to you, this bottle of water was held by Elvis and that's why you should pay\nme $50 for it, that's fraud. But if I say, this is\nthe water that has been, this water has drank by the finest people, presidents drink this water. Now this is puffery. Advertising marketing is based on puffery. It's not fraud. When it's fraud, it crosses the line. So there's a different between\nhonestly and candor, right? So in relationships, being honest is good, being totally candid is\nprobably not a great idea. It's indelicate to be totally candid, about something things. The woman you're in a\nromantic relationship with says to you, \"Do I look\ngood in this dress?\" And they don't. Do so I look fat in this? That's a better. Any heterosexual man who's\never been in a relationship has had that question asked of him, \"Do I look fat in this? Does this make my butt look big?\" Or does whatever it is\nthis, do I look fat in this? If you go, yes, that's\nindelicate, it's honest, but it's indelicate and\nit's almost mean, right? And if you say no, but it's true, she doesn't look good in that. Like the concern she's sees\nis a legitimate concern. Do you lie and go, no, no,\nyou look great in that. It's great, da, da, da. That's not a good thing either. So what do you say? You know, that blue dress you have really compliments your body, like in a way that one doesn't, you know that, the cut\nof that dress is such that it doesn't flatter you. I see what you're saying.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Now it's the dress, it's\nnot you babe, you know, but I'm telling you the truth. Like I'm addressing your concern. This is the distinction. Don't material misrepresent the facts. Like don't steer people down\nroads that they're, you know, you know that that's not\nhow it's gonna go, right? So it's like if the\nwoman says, I love you, and you don't love her,\ndon't say, I love you back. You do the like, oh, you know, I have very strong\nfeelings for you as well. Or you know, like there has\nto be some middle ground. You don't just pretend\nyou didn't hear them. - Yeah, I mean I guess\nall of it requires skill, just like you described. And I think just being honest\nin quotes is not enough. - Well, it's not a specific\nenough instruction. (Lex laughs) I mean, that's the problem you see, when you write a relationship book, which I never intended to do. People come to you and say, what are the things I should\ndo to help my relationship? Or what is the cause of divorce? And you go, well, disconnection, but like, what do you mean by that? Or like, how do I improve my relationship? Pay more attention. Make small gestures. Okay, what does that even mean? Like what do you mean? Acts of love. You should show your partner\nthat you love them more often. What do you mean? Like what I say, what I do? We should have more sex? Like what are you at, what are you saying? People want measurable, specific things. So that's why I tried\nin my book to be like, very specific about\nlike things you can do, things you shouldn't do. And they're practical suggestions. Like leaving a note. I talk a lot about leaving a note. If you're dating someone\nor you're living with them or you're in a serious relationship, send a text, leave a note,\njust little every day, just some little thing\nthat just tells them how much you like them. Like this is a low cost, high value move doesn't take much and it's a practical thing. But when we speak in these\nsort of like broader axioms, these broader concepts\nthat people just don't have any idea how to practically apply. - I can't wait to listen to the audiobook where you talk about\nmanaging marital finances as like anal sex, which your mastery of the metaphor (James laughs) touches one's heart and soul, your Shakespeare of the\n21st century really. - I don't know that Shakespeare\nwould've brought anal up in that context, but I appreciate it. Yeah, yeah.\n(lex laughs) My thesis there or my\npoint there was, you know, proceed carefully and have\ndiscussion in advance. - [Lex] Yes. - And don't just spring it on someone. - [Lex] Sure. - And realize that if this goes wrong, it will go catastrophically wrong. So good communication is\nimportant and, you know, yeah. I don't think it's\nsomething you should just dive into unless you're prepared for that to have potentially very negative impact. - And finances is one of the sources of a huge amount of stress\nin relationships, which is- - Tremendous. Because it's about value, I think. I mean, aside from having painful conversations about what you tried to do and were able to do, or what your impulse control was in terms of what you spent money on, like there's the conversation and then there's what's\nunderneath the conversation. There's gender stuff about men feeling the need to be a provider. There's gender stuff of men or women thinking material goods will fill the void and buying things and then\ncreating stress on their partner. There's the very human desire\nto make things seem effortless so your spouse doesn't feel any stress, when in fact it's causing\ntremendous financial stress. And then when the dam\nbreaks, it breaks hard. So yeah, there's a lot. Finances is tricky stuff. And you could probably\nbe wonderful romantic and sexual partners and\nhave very different styles of how you handle your finances and how you handle your\nfinances is informed by, not only your individual psychology, but also how you were raised and how your family\ntaught you about finance and how you should\nconduct your finances so. - And there's interesting\npower dynamics in play. - Tremendously, yeah. Those are very tricky because\nthe standard of living of a couple becomes\nimportant in a divorce, but sometimes this\ntoxic standard of living that created toxic levels of stress is one of the causes of the divorce. - [Lex] Yeah. - And they're asking the court to maintain a financial obligation on you. That is the reason why\nthe marriage fell apart. And that feels like a particularly insulting form of indignity. - Well, you're a fascinating\nhuman being on many levels, but you're also exceptionally productive. And you've talked to me\nabout waking up early. For you, we've met today at 11:00 AM. And for you, that's what\nlate afternoon I suppose. - [James] Yeah. - We had to negotiate\nand come to an agreement because I went to bed at 4:00 AM. - And I was up at, I get\nup at four every day. - [Lex] You woke up at four.\n- So now I'm here. Well, I woke it's three\no'clock local time. - [Lex] Yes. - So I woke up at three local time. - [Lex] Nice. - Yeah, I wake up at four naturally, then my body just wakes up.\n- [Lex] Oh wow. - And wakes up-\n- [Lex] That's fascinating. - Full on this speed.\n- [Lex] Wow. - Like my most productive writing and speaking is from 4:00\nAM until noon or one. - So can you take me through a productive, like a perfectly productive day? - I wake up at 4:00 AM very naturally. I wish I didn't, but I do check my phone first thing 'cause I wanna see if\nany emergencies came in from a client overnight. - [Lex] So work emergencies. - Yeah, work related emergencies. And it is a divorce lawyer. Our definition of emergency\ncan be very serious. It's people absconding with a child. It's a police being involved\nin a domestic violence. And so they can be like\ntime sensitive things. And when someone is\nhiring a divorce lawyer, I think they're hiring, they\nwant someone responsive. My clients have my cell phone number and I go to bed early\nbecause I get up early. And so I go to sleep by 8:00 PM latest. I don't think I've seen 9:00\nPM even on New Year's Eve. So I wake up at four, I check\nmy phone, check my email. Usually even if there's something that's, you know, time sensitive, it's usually not so time sensitive that it needs to be\nresponded to at 4:00 AM 'cause most other normal\npeople are asleep. I have espresso, black espresso,\nwhich I enjoy very much. And then I work out, and that's some days gonna be weights, a lot of days it's just gonna be cardio. I've changed my habits now\nthat I'm in my early 50s. It used to be much more\nintensive weight training and deadlifts and stuff like that. And then I herniated my L5S1. So 485 was my max deadlift. And now I don't hardly do deadlifts. - Well, you can still\nrelive the past glory? - I do. I still I have some pictures of videos. - [Lex] You have pictures.\n- I have videos. I have videos of me putting 485 for three. - But you can, in stories,\nwhen you talk about it, you can exaggerate how much\nyou've actually lifted. - That's true. But then you can't back it up. See, I'm very evidence-based. So if I don't have a photo or video of it, it's just puffing, mere puffery at that point. But I work out and then I try to work\nout for like a good hour. And I do that partly because of stress. I think when I don't\nwork out, it's difficult. I had a group of guys\nthat I would do jiu-jitsu with at 5:00 AM, they were\nmostly law enforcement. They were cops who would\neither be starting a shift or coming off of a night shift. And we would train together,\njust do like an open mat. And it was at 5:00 AM till\nsix and that was heaven. I love training jiu-jitsu first thing in the morning if I can. And then I always do either a sauna or steam for 20 minutes, half an hour. And then I do a cold plunge. Or if I don't have access to\na cold plunge, a cold shower. And then I have breakfast, and it's usually a very\nuncontroversial simple breakfast. I like to eat, you know, I eat like slow carb,\nTim Ferriss type style. And then I get right to work. I try to do my drafting early in the day. Prenups, motions, things like that from let's say six or\nseven until nine, 9:30, which is when court begins. - So drafting is like writing\nup different documents. - Right, writing prenups,\nwriting separation agreements, writing settlement proposals,\nwriting motions for the court, pretrial memos, which is like research that I wanna present to a judge\nthat supports my arguments. I do drafting. I review documents that the attorneys who work for me have\ndrafted and refine them. And then court is usually\nfrom nine o'clock until noon. And if we're on trial, then it's a whole different pace, because trials, the lunch break\nisn't really a lunch break. You're preparing the afternoon's witnesses and you're trying to do damage control on what happened in the morning. But if it's just court conferences, like most cases, there's conferences. Conferences as you go in,\nyou make oral argument, but you don't have witnesses on the stand, you're not taking testimony. It's like everybody's just\nshouting allegations back and forth and making\ntemporary arguments pretrial. It's kinda the foreplay\nof the trial, right? - Is that exhausting by the way? - It's exhausting when\nyou're done with it. Like while you're doing\nit, it's exhilarating. I always say that I never sleep as poorly as the night before a trial. And I never sleep as well as\nthe night I finished a trial. - [Lex] Yeah. - Because when I am on trial,\nI am speaking, listening, watching the judge closely to\nsee what they're reacting to and when they're paying attention\nor not paying attention, watching opposing counsel\nand the opposing party. When is the opposing party\nwriting a little note to their lawyer to show it to them? What is the opposing counsel objecting to? My client is trying to\npass me notes half the time while I'm speaking and\nmaking my arguments. I'm trying to like adjust\nwhat I'm doing strategically based on the objections\nthat the judge is ruling on. So I'm so hyperstimulated on trial that when you finish you can't even talk. You're gone. Your brain is jello.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Conferences is harder because at least with a trial there's a singularity of focus. Like with a trial, it's just one case and\nthey have all my attention. The problem is, is then\non the lunch break, all the other cases\nthat I've been ignoring for the last several hours\nwhile I was on trial, they all have stuff going on. So it's like, hey, where's that\nsettlement proposal on this, Hey this, she just did this. We need to file a motion. So now it's like, okay,\nI have an hour to eat and to answer all of this\nin some preliminary way to delegate some responsibilities. And then I gotta go back in and put a 100% on my focus\non this other case again. So you find yourself in a place. That's why I'm very disciplined, is you find yourself in a place where I live my whole life in\nsix minute increments, tenths of an hour, 'cause we\nbill in tenths of an hour. So everything I do,\nit's like 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and I'm logging time throughout the day. - [Lex] That's fascinating. - And you find yourself\nat the end of the day. My son is a lawyer, my older son. He's a district attorney\nand I'm very proud of him. He gets to put bad guys in jail and he's very smart and\nhe's doing a great job. He just about a year ago. And when he graduated from law school, we were very close and we\nwere talking and he said, we were just talking about like the career and the law that he\nwas about to embark on. And I said to him, you know, the feeling at the end of the day when like all your homework\nor all your work is done and you just go, okay, it's all done now and I'm gonna go home. You'll never have that feeling ever again, ever. You're just gonna every day go, alright, it's enough, it's enough. I gotta, I got it, I gotta get outta here. - [Lex] Yeah. - Because you could, with\nevery one of these cases, you could stay up 24\nhours focusing just on it. So you have to have the discipline to go. Yeah, no, that's it. I'm done for now. I've done what I could do today, and now I'm going to sit\nand read for a half an hour. I'm gonna watch this\nshow for a half an hour. I'm gonna have this meal because you, it's never done, you know,\nso that's challenging. That's a hard part of this job. But I think my discipline helps with that. And then I like I said, I finish my day around 5:30, six o'clock, and I have something to eat and I try to wind down a little. And I'm usually in bed by\n7:30 and asleep by eight. - You mentioned jiu-jitsu. You're a brown belt, what role has jiu-jitsu\nplayed in your life? - I love jiu-jitsu. I trained martial arts from\nthe time I was a little kid. I think I was seven or eight. I took up budokan and goju karate, and I did judo and it was\nalways part of my life. And then I got to college and grad school and I didn't have time for it\nand I didn't do it so much. And then I got divorced. I was quite young still\nwhen I got divorced and I had two young kids and I thought, well, I can like, you know, grow a goatee and buy a convertible and do like the thing\nyou're supposed to do when you're dude with\nkids close to middle age, or I can try to do\nsomething more productive. And so I said, well, maybe\nI'll go back to martial arts. So I took up Muay Thai, kickboxing, and they had a jiu-jitsu class at the same school after\nthe Muay Thai class. And I had been around the\norbit of jiu-jitsu having been, my kids took karate and\nthere was jiu-jitsu there, it was a Gracie Academy. And I stayed for a jiu-jitsu class and I had 120 pound girl ragdoll me, 'cause I just knew\nnothing about grappling. And I remember just going, well,\nI gotta learn what this is. And that was it. I just dove into it. My first professor was Louis\nVintaloro in New Jersey's, a Royler Gracie black belt. Great teacher, taught\nme amazing fundamentals. Took me all the way up to purple belt. And then right after I got my purple belt, I moved to the city, I moved to Manhattan. I actually chose my apartment based on its proximity to Marcelo Garcia. (Lex laughs) And I moved to West Chelsea because it was a short\nwalk to Marcelo's Academy. My core jiu-jitsu was up to purple belt. It was Louis Vintaloro. And then it's been Marcelo,\nand Marcelo, Paul Shriner, who's really phenomenal at his academy. And all of people at his academy, I mean, are are all phenomenal. I mean, Bernardo was\nthere for a period of time that I was there, and\nbefore he went to Boston, Marcos Tinoco was like\nhis lasso guard stuff. He was at Marcelo's for a long time. And what a teacher, I mean, my lack of skill at\njiu-jitsu is not based on a lack of quality instruction. (Lex laughs) It's based on an inability\nto retain the information, you know, for very long. - I mean, like for me, that's one of the most reliable place I can go to humble myself. - I love jiu-jitsu. I love the progressive humility that it drives home constantly. I love the impossibility of perfecting it. Although Gordon Ryan's probably come close and Marcello's probably\ncome close to perfecting it. - Let me ask you actually,\nsince you mentioned Gordon Ryan, (James laughs) so apparently some close with Gordon and I'm sure you know, in Austin, just this jiu-jitsu\nscene, this incredible. - It's jitsu mecca, yeah.\n- He is the mecca. - I'm actually seeing\nJohn Danaher this evening. - So he's, I mean, yeah, this is like- - [James] Yeah, this is amazing. - A truly special place. But anyway, apparently long\nago you mentioned Jersey, (James laughs) there's a bit of a conflict\nbetween you and Gordon and you mentioned to me\noffline that you love him and like just how much\nrespect you have for him as an athlete and so on. But can you explain why is this be? - Yeah, I'm actually glad I have the, it's funny that you bring it\nup and of all the, you know, we're talking about all these heavy topics and this is probably the\none that I find most, the most actually emotional. But Gordon's a very, I think\na very young man still, he's like probably in\nhis 20s or early 30s. And it's hard to imagine that 'cause he is accomplished\nso much as an athlete and as a business person. But there was a time, you\nknow, not that long ago, I think it was eight or nine years ago, where he was just a\nyoung guy on his way up. He's only, I think a couple\nyears older than my oldest son. And I, through a series of\ncircumstances, jiu-jitsu wasn't, it's really exploded in the last 10 years, but there were not as many people sponsoring quote unquote super fights. There really weren't like\njiu-jitsu super fights being sponsored Jersey\nand New York particular. And I got involved in sponsoring some jiu-jitsu super fights. And I also got involved in sponsoring some jiu-jitsu athletes. And Gordon was a young part\nof the Danaher Death Squad. I was friends with Eddie Cummings. I'm still friends with Eddie. I was friends with John,\nI'm still friends with John, but I didn't really know Gordon. I actually don't know\nthat I've still ever met. I don't think I've ever met Gordon. I've been in the same room as him. But there was a fight that, I had sponsored some other fights with this particular promoter and they asked me to sponsor one. And it didn't involve\nanyone from Marcelo's, but it involved Gordon. He was one of the people. And I liked John very much and I liked everybody in\nthe Danaher Death Squad. I like watching them compete. And I thought, you know, I\nthink John's just brilliant. I mean everyone at\nMarcelo's has such respect for John and for everyone. And the stuff they were doing, like when they were the early days of that Danaher Death Squad, like the Eddie Cummings,\nlike his leg locks. He just blew the whole game up. It just was a whole\nnother thing, you know, it was like insane what\nthey did such innovation. And Gordon at the time was he was online and I'm much older than that. I'm in my early 50s and that's not, I guess chronologically that much older, but generationally I think\nit's quite a bit different. And Gordon was smack\ntalking with a guy who I, about a guy who I was sponsor of, who I knew and who I knew\nwas a very good athlete and had been through\ndifficult things in his life. And Gordon just said some\nlike nasty things about him. It falls into the category of totally appropriate smack talking, looking at it now and looking\nat what Gordon became, which is he's someone who talks trash. It's like part of his\nbrand is to talk trash. And I see now that that's\nlike a Muhammad Ali thing, but the time I just didn't\nsee it as what it was. And although it doesn't excuse\nit, my mother was dying. I was not at my best, I\nwas having a hard time. And Gordon had spoken ill of this person and I got upset and I reached out to John and to Tom DeBlass, and I said to them, \"Hey, like, could you tell\nthis guy to knock it off? Don't talk about this person who I sponsor if I'm\nsponsoring his fight.\" I don't even know this Gordon Ryan kid and I'm sponsoring his fight\nand he should say thank you. Don't talk bad about a\nperson I financially sponsor, like that's not cool. And I think on Facebook, he like wrote some comments and then I wrote some comments back and I was incredibly obnoxious. And very soon after I felt really gross, 'cause I was an adult and I was talking to a\nyoung person this way, who's on their way up, who's like a little older\nthan one of my kids. And I just said these\nobnoxious things to him. And I felt really like,\nthat's gross, you know. But I'd never really\nthought much about it again. I watched his star rise and I was very, I mean, who's not\nimpressed by Gordon Ryan, and everyone at our\nacademy was always very like thrilled to see him rise. And I've stayed friends with John and every time Gordon\nwould have a big victory, I would always text John and be like, because Gordon's victories\nare John's victories too. They have such a great bond. All the people in his orbit like are all people\nthat I respect and like, and I just would say, \"Hey\nlisten, congratulations, and please pass all my\ncongratulations to Gordon.\" We don't know each other. I don't have his number, I have no way to contact\nhim to apologize to him. But you know, if Gordon hears this, I am profoundly sorry. I don't say that 'cause I'm trying to\nget in your good graces. I don't know that we'll\never meet each other, but that was a unbelievably wrong, stupid thing to say to a young person. - Well, thank you for saying that. This warms my heart in general. - So you talk to a divorce\nlawyer and it warms your heart. Look at that. - Well, speaking of which, you're a romantic actually,. You've seen love, you've seen love break down completely. What role does love play\nin the human condition? - I mean, it's kind of everything, right? Like it's love is, romantic love wars are\nfought for romantic love. Empires fall because of romantic love. Like it takes down kings. It takes down, you know, we're all just struggling for it. We're all just chasing it. Like we're all chasing the dragon. It's like the rush we all are. So it's huge. It's huge. I mean, sex and love, which I like to believe\nare in some way connected and love and romance, which again, I like to believe are\nin some way connected. I think it's huge. Look, I've always thought most\nof what men do, including me, we do to get laid, like on some level. You wanna be successful. Why? So you can have money. Why? So you can have nice things so that you can attract attractive members of the opposite sex. Like a lot of things come down to that. And even for like men, like red pilled, men, who are like, yeah,\nI don't care about women. Well, you talk about 'em an awful lot. Like for someone that's\nnot interested in women, you sure are like in the orbit of women who you're telling how much\nyou don't care about women, which kind of feels like you're doing that to attract a certain kind of woman, which I get, you know,\nlike more power to you. A person who worships an idol and a person who destroys\nan idol or both idolers. - [Lex] Yes. - If all you're talking about\nis how you don't need women, you're talking about women an awful lot. So it's just such a\nsplinter in people's mind, relationships, breakups, and like it's such a great equalizer. I mean, you're spending some time in the rarefied air now of\nlike big celebrity people. And I remember when I\nstarted out as a lawyer just doing like the regular, like the cop and the teacher with a 401k, and they didn't have any assets. I remember thinking like, well, someday if I represent celebrities or wealthy CEOs, like\nthey'll be different. They'll be like smarter. They'll be like different. It's just the same-\n- [Lex] It's the same. - Weird petty shit, the\nsame infidelity, the same. - The same kind of insecurities,\nthe same kind of jealousy, the same kind of fights. - [James] Yeah.\n- It all. - It's all the same.\n(Lex laughs) But it is, it's like it, and it's all this same\ninsecurity, sadness. It's the same like desire to be validated, like mommy issues, daddy\nissues, like intimacy issues, you know, and it's all the same stuff. And just because you're\nreally good at other things. Like I've represented\nprofessional athletes who are phenomenal world class, doctors, business people, and they suck at relationships. No better than like anybody else. There's no connection between the skills that made you a good entrepreneur and the skills that made you\na good spouse or partner. I'm sure there's some\noverlap, like patience is good and thinking strategically\nis probably good. I'm just humbled by how\nwe're called to it still like it's so, and even when we lose and even when like our greatest pains were caused by our desire to love and be loved in a romantic sense, we just keep putting the money\non the table and playing. We won't just quit. We just keep going. - [Lex] And the whole\nmess of it is worth it. - I mean, I guess, I guess so. It's calling us. I don't know if it's worth it or not. That's a value judgment, right? We don't stop. I don't know a lot of people that, that they played the hand\nthey lost and they went, well, no more of that game for me. I'm not a good poker player. I'm not playing poker anymore. I know people who've done that. I know people that are\nlike, listen, I don't drink, like, you know, I'm allergic. I break out in handcuffs\nand hospital bills. I'm not drinking anymore. But I don't know people that are like, man, that relationship, I screwed that up. Or I got screwed on that one,\nI'm not doing that anymore. You can say that. Everybody says that. I'm through with love, you know, I'm done. They're not, they keep going. They'll go up again. - Never gonna fall in love again. And then a few weeks later. - Yeah, I got job security,\nman, I got job security. People are not gonna stop\nwalking down that aisle. They are not gonna stop having kids with people that they probably\nshould have thought through, whether they would have kids\nwith that person or not. - But I'm glad they are. I'm glad they're taking that leap. I'm glad they've taken that risk. It's this whole beautiful\nmess that we're all a part of. It's like taking that risk. - [James] Yeah. - Taking that leap of vulnerabilities of what this whole thing is about. - Yeah, and what a danger\nif we didn't, you know. - [Lex] Yeah. - You hear about people\nlike Alexander Hamilton or you hear about, you\nknow, people who like, they were born of circumstances that like these two people should\nnever have had a kid and then they did. And that kid changes the world. And moves the dial forward and what a like what great mistake. What a great, you can't\never say it's a mistake. Like what an amazing thing that happened. And I think that that's one of the things I like about divorce as a practice and as almost looking at it\nlike a spiritual practice. I think you just don't\nknow what is a blessing, right, in the world. You just don't know. My father, I've spoken\nabout this before publicly, and he does frequently. My father's an alcoholic. My father's been in recovery\nnow for seven years, I think, yeah. But he was a bad alcoholic. Vietnam veteran my whole life, and only got sober, you\nknow, when I was in my 40s. And a lot of the personality\ncharacteristics I have are consistent with those of\nadult children, of alcoholics, desire for control and control issues, lot of those things. And I love my life. I'm having a great time. If I died tomorrow, man,\nI did more, learn more, earned more, loved more\nthan I ever dreamed. And so I'm so glad my\ndad was an alcoholic. And if you said to me,\nhow do you raise kids? I wouldn't say like, well, you definitely\nwanna be an alcoholic, 'cause like your kid's gonna\nget a lot of really good discipline lessons from that experience. No, like I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't want that for, but it's born, like all\nthese wonderful things were born of this awful situation. So I think divorce is the same thing. We make these mistakes, right? But they're not really, like often have to say to my clients when they're like, oh, I wish\nI'd never married this person. I'm like, you love your kids, right? Your kids are half that person. They would not be the organism they are without that person's DNA. So you can't regret being with that person if you love your kids. Like if you love your kids, those kids don't exist\nwithout that person. And I don't know how we refocus on that. I don't know, maybe we give, anyone going through a divorce, I've actually had a theory,\nwhich I've not said out loud, but I'll say it to you\n'cause it's just us talking. I think if we could figure out a way to take a divorcing couple that is interested in\npotentially mediating and put them in a setting where we could give them both psilocybin like a good dose, like 2\nand a 1/2, three grams, and have them do individual sessions with controlled setting with a guide, right? And have them sort of do that inner work and then have them do some\nkind of a session together after they've had that experience, that psychedelic experience. I actually think you could do\ntransformative divorce work because I have found myself, and certainly, the many\npeople that I've talked to who've had psilocybin\nexperiences in particular, but any psychedelic experience, many of the empathogens, right? Or even like MDMA, you know, like MDMA, which is an empathogen. If we brought that space and the divorce and conflict resolution space together, that sort of psychopharmacological\nintervention on empathy, one's empathy receptors\nor one's connectivity, I think that could be\nradically transforming. It would be logistically\nan absolute nightmare. It would never get done\nfrom a legal standpoint. But man, like I think\nsometimes like that if, because I think the more\nthat you can bring people to the awareness of connection that comes from many people's\npsychedelic experiences, I think they could then\nextrapolate that into their understanding of the conflict and disconnect they're\nhaving with their partner. - So really lean into the, like use this brink of\ndivorce as a kind of catalyst. - [James] Yeah. - For doing a lot of soul searching, a lot of growth together. - Well, that was what\nappealed to me about it. I mean, before I started doing it. Is it was this idea that\nthis is a opportunity for radical reinvention.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - It was an opportunity for people to say, okay, now what? I didn't expect that, now what? And it was to be part of\nthe architecture of that. I didn't look at it like I'm\nhelping demolish the building. It was like, I'm tearing down the building so we can build the new one, which I hope is filled with\njoy and abundance and peace and love and real love, real satisfaction. My ex-wife is married\nfor over a decade now to a phenomenal guy\nwho is perfect for her. And he is nothing like me, by the way. If you met him and you've met both of us, you'd go, well, no one could\nlove both of these guys. He's like, if you like this flavor, you wouldn't like this flavor. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like, I'm impatient, fast\ntalking, skip to the end, we gotta land this plane, come on. And he's like, he's therapist, he's chill, he's certainly patient and\nthey're perfect together. And I can say that as someone\nwho loves her and loved her, and knows her or knew her, and I think if we can, you know, if we can radically view honestly, like without jealousy, without the sense of like, look at it and just go, yeah, yeah, okay. Like this is the love this person needed. That doesn't mean my love sucks. Just means it wasn't the\nright one for this person. You know, like there's someone in, there's a lid for every pot. Like she found her lid. I want her to find her lid. That's good. - And there's billions of pots out there and we just need to match\n'em with the proper lid. - Yeah, and not hit\neach other over the head with 'em all day long. - Yeah, man, this is\nsuch a romantic few hours we've got to spend together, and there's even a candle\nburning over there. - Is there? Oh, that's lovely. - All right, brother,\nthanks so much, James. - Thank you. Thanks for having me. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with James Sexton. To support this podcast, Please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you\nwith some words from Rumi. \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and\nfind all the barriers within yourself that you\nhave built against it.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
