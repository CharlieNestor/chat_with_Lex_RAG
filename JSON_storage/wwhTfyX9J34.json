      "text": "- So you have an original life event. It evolves for 4 billion\nyears, at least on our planet. It evolves a technosphere. The technologies themselves start having this property we call life, which is the phase we're undergoing now. It solves the origin of itself, and then it figures out\nhow that process all works, understands how to make more life and then can copy itself\nonto another planet, so the whole structure\ncan reproduce itself. - The following is a\nconversation with Sara Walker, her third time in this podcast. She is an astrobiologist\nand theoretical physicist, interested in the origin of life and in discovering alien\nlife on other worlds. She has written an amazing\nnew upcoming book titled, \"Life as No One Knows It: The\nPhysics of Life's Emergence.\" This book is coming out on August 6th, so please go pre-order it now. It will blow your mind. This is a Lex Fridman podcast, to support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Sara Walker."

      "text": "You open the book, \"Life\nas No One Knows It: The Physics of Life's Emergence,\" with the distinction\nbetween the materialists and the vitalists. So what's the difference?\nCan you maybe define the two? - I think the question there is about whether life can be\ndescribed in terms of matter and you know, physical things, or whether there is some other feature, that's not physical, that\nactually animates living things. So for a long time people\nmaybe have called that a soul. It's been really hard to\npin down what that is. So I think the vitalist\nidea is really that, it's kind of a dualistic interpretation, that there's sort of\nthe material properties, but there's something\nelse that animates life that is there when you're alive and it's not there when you're dead. And materialists kind of don't think that there's anything really special about the matter of life and the material substrates\nthat life is made out of. So they disagree on some\nreally fundamental points. - Is there a gray area between the two? Like maybe all there is is matter, but there's so much we don't know that it might as well be magic? (Sara laughs) That like whatever that\nmagic that the vitalists see. Meaning like-\n- Yeah. - There's just so much mystery that it's really unfair\nto say that it's boring and understood, and as simple\nas quote unquote \"physics.\" - Yeah, I think the entire\nuniverse is just a giant mystery. I guess that's what\nmotivates me as a scientist. And so oftentimes when\nI look at open problems like the nature of life or consciousness, or you know, what is intelligence? Or are there souls? Or whatever question that we have, that we feel like we aren't even on the tip of answering yet. I think, you know, we\nhave a lot more work to do to really understand the\nanswers to these questions. So it's not magic, it's just the unknown. And I think a lot of the history of humans coming to understand the world around us has been taking ideas that\nwe once thought were magic or supernatural, and really understanding\nthem in a much deeper way, that we learn what those things are, and they still have an air of mystery even when we understand them. There's no sort of bottom\nto our understanding. - So do you think the\nvitalists have a point, that they're more eager and able to notice the magic of life? - I think that no tradition,\nvitalists included, is ever fully wrong about the nature of the things\nthat they're describing. So a lot of times when\nI look at different ways that people have described\nthings across human history, across different cultures, there's always a seed of truth in them, and I think it's really important\nto try to look for those, because if there are narratives that humans have been telling ourselves for thousands of years, for\nthousands of generations, there must be some truth to them. You know, we've been\nlearning about reality for a really long time, and we recognize the patterns\nthat reality presents us, we don't always understand\nwhat those patterns are. And so I think it's really important to pay attention to that. So I don't think the\nvitalists were actually wrong, and a lot of what I\ntalk about in the book, but also I think about a\nlot just professionally, is the nature of our\ndefinitions of what's material, and how science has come to\ninvent the concept of matter. And that some of those things\nactually really are inventions that happened in a particular time, in a particular technology that could learn about certain patterns and help us understand them, and that there are some patterns\nwe still don't understand. And if we knew how to measure those things or we knew how to describe\nthem in a more rigorous way, we would realize that the\nmaterial world, matter, has more properties than\nwe thought that it did. And one of those might be associated with the thing that we call life. Life could be a material property and still have a lot of the features that the vitalists\nthought were mysterious. - So we may still expand our understanding what is incorporated in\nthe category of matter that will eventually\nincorporate such magical things that the vitalists have noticed- - Yeah-\n- Like life. - Yeah, so I think about... I always like to use\nexamples from physics, so I'll probably do that to, (laughs) Like it's my go-to place. But you know, in the history\nof gravitational physics, for example, in the history of motion, you know like when Aristotle came up with his theories of motion, he did it by the material\nproperties he thought things had. So there was a concept of\nthings falling to Earth because they were solid-like, and things raising to the\nheavens 'cause they were airlike, and things moving around the planet 'cause they were celestial-like. But then we came to realize\nthat thousands of years later and after the invention\nof many technologies that allowed us to actually measure time in a mechanistic way and\ntrack planetary motion, and we could, you know, roll\nballs down inclined planes and track that progress. We realized that if we\njust talked about mass and acceleration, we could\nunify all motion in the universe in a really simple description. So we didn't really have\nto worry about the fact that my cup is heavy and the air is light, like the same laws describe them, if we have the right material\nproperties to talk about what those laws are\nactually interacting with. And so I think the issue with life is, we don't know how to\nthink about information in a material way. And so we haven't been able\nto build a unified description of what life is or the kind of things\nthat evolution builds, because we haven't really invented the right material concept yet. - So when talking about motion, the laws of physics appear to be the same everywhere out in the universe. You think the same is true\nfor other kinds of matter that we might eventually include life in? - I think life obeys universal principles. I think there is some deep\nunderlying exploratory framework that will tell us about the\nnature of life in the universe and will allow us to identify life that we can't yet recognize\nbecause it's too different. - You write about the\nparadox of defining life. Why does this seem to be so easy and so complicated at the same time? - You know, all the sort\nof classic definitions people want to use just don't work. They don't work in all cases. So Carl Sagan had this wonderful essay on definitions of life, where I think he talks about aliens coming from another planet, If they saw Earth, they might think that cars\nwere the dominant life form because there's so many\nof them on our planet, and like humans are inside them, and you might wanna exclude machines, but any definition, you know, like classic biology textbook definitions would also include them. And so, you know, he\nwanted to draw a boundary between these kind of things\nby trying to exclude them, but they were naturally included by the definitions people wanna give. And in fact, what he ended up pointing out is that all of the definitions\nof life that we have, whether it's, life is a\nself reproducing system, or life eats to survive, or life requires\ncompartments, whatever it is, there's always a counter example that challenges that definition. This is why viruses are so\nhard or why fire is so hard. And so we've had a really hard time trying to pin down, from a\ndefinitional perspective, exactly what life is. - Yeah, you actually bring\nup the zombie-ant fungus. I enjoyed looking at this thing, (Sara laughs)\nas an example of one of the challenges. You mentioned viruses,\nbut this is a parasite. Look at that. - Did you see this in jungle?\n- In fact, ants... Actually one of the interesting\nthings about the jungle, that everything is ephemeral. Like everything eats\neverything really quickly. So if an organism dies,\nthat organism disappears. - Yeah.\n- It's a machine that doesn't have... I wanted to say it doesn't\nhave a memory or a history, which is interesting\ngiven your work on history in defining a living being. The jungle forgets very quickly. It wants to erase the fact\nthat you existed very quickly. - Yeah, but it can't erase it,\nit's just restructuring it. And I think the other thing\nthat is really, you know, vivid to me about this\nexample that you're giving is, how much death is necessary for life. So I worry a bit about\nnotions of immortality and whether immortality\nis a good thing or not. So I have sort of a broad conception that life is the only thing\nthe universe generates that actually has even the\npotential to be immortal. But that's as like the sort of process that you're describing, where life is about memory\nand historical contingency, and construction of new possibilities. But when you look at any instance of life, especially one as dynamic\nas what you're describing, it's a constant birth and death process. But that birth and death process is like, the way that the universe can explore what possibilities can exist, and not everything, not\nevery possible human or every possible ant or\nevery possible zombie ant or every possible tree will ever live. So it's, you know, it's\nan incredibly dynamic and creative place\nbecause of all that death. - So does this thing... This is a parasite that needs the ant. So is this a living thing or is this not a living thing? So this is- - Yeah, so-\n- It just pierces the ant. I mean it-\n- Right. - And I've seen a lot of this by the way, organisms working together in the jungle, like ants protecting a\ndelicious piece of fruit. So they need the fruit. But like if you touch that fruit, they're going to like... The forces emerge. - Yeah.\n- They're fighting you, they're defending that fruit. - Right.\n- To the death. Nature seems to find\nmutual benefits, right? - Yeah, it does. I think the thing that's perplexing for me about these kind of examples is, you know, effectively the ant's dead\nbut it's staying alive now 'cause it's piloted by this fungus. And so that gets back to this, you know, thing that we're talking\nabout a few minutes ago about how the boundary of\nlife is really hard to define. So you know, anytime that\nyou wanna draw a boundary around something and you say, \"This feature is the thing\nthat makes this alive,\" or \"This thing is alive on its own,\" there's not ever really a clear boundary, and these kind of examples are\nreally good at showing that, because it's like the thing\nthat you would've thought is the living organism is now dead, except that it has another living organism that's piloting it. So the two of them together\nare alive in some sense, but they're, you know, now in this kind of weird\nsymbiotic relationship that's taking this ant to its death. - So what do you do with that in terms of when you try to define life? - I think we have to get rid of the notion of an individual as being relevant. And this is really difficult because you know, a lot of the ways that we think about life, like the fundamental\nunit of life is the cell, individuals are alive, but we don't think about how\ngray that distinction is. So for example, you might consider, you know, self reproduction to be the most defining feature\nof life, a lot of people do. Actually like it's, you know, one of these standard\ndifferent definitions that a lot of people\nin my field like to use in astrobiology is, life is a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution. Which I was once quoted as agreeing with, and I was really offended,\nbecause I hate that definition. I think it's terrible, and I think it's terrible\nthat people use it. I think like every word in that definition is actually wrong as a descriptor of life. - Life is a self-sustaining\nchemical system capable of Darwinian evolution. Why is that... That seems like a pretty good definition. - Yeah, I know. If you wanna make me angry\nyou can pretend I said that, (Sara laughs) and believed it. - So self-sustaining chemical system, Darwinian evolution. What is self-sustaining?\nWhat's so frustrating? I mean which aspect is frustrating to you, but it's also, those are\nvery interesting words. - Yeah, they're all interesting words and you know, together\nthey sound really smart and they sound like they\nbox in what life is. But you can use any of\nthe words individually and you can come up with counter examples that don't fulfill that property. The self-sustaining one\nis really interesting, thinking about humans, right? Like we're not self-sustaining, we're dependent on societies. And so, you know, I find\nit paradoxical that, you know, it might be that societies, because they are self-sustaining units, are now more alive than individuals are. And that could be the case. But I still think we have some property associated with life. I mean that's the thing that\nwe're trying to describe. So that one's quite hard. And in general, you know, no organism is really self-sustaining. They always require an environment. So being self-sustaining\nis coupled, in some sense, to the world around you. We don't live in a vacuum, so that part's already challenging, and then you can go to chemical system. I don't think that's good either. I think there's a confusion because life emerges in\nchemistry, that life is chemical. I don't think life is chemical. I think life emerges in chemistry because chemistry is the first\nthing the universe builds where it cannot exhaust\nall the possibilities, because the combinatorial space\nof chemistry is too large. - Well but is it possible to have a life that is not a chemical system? - Yes. - Well, there's a guy I\nknow named Lee Cronin, he's been on the podcast a couple times. He just got really pissed off-\n- I know that guy too- - Listening to this. (laughs)\n- What a coincidence. He probably just got really\npissed off hearing that. For people who somehow\ndon't know, he's a chemist. - Yeah, but he would\nagree with that statement. - Would he? I don't think he would. I don't think he would. He would broaden the\ndefinition of chemistry until it'll include everything. - Oh sure.\n- Okay, so you're- - Or maybe, I don't know,\n- But wait, but you said that universe, the first thing it creates is chemistry. - Very precisely, it's not the first thing it creates, obviously like, it has\nto make atoms first, but it's the first thing, like if you think about, you know, the universe originated, atoms were made in, you know,\nBig Bang nucleosynthesis, and then later in stars,\nand then planets formed, and planets become engines of chemistry. They start exploring what\nkind of chemistry is possible. And the combinatorial space\nof chemistry is so large that even on every planet\nin the entire universe, you will never express\nevery possible molecule. I like this example\nactually that Lee gave me, which is to think about Taxol, it has a molecular weight of about 853. It's got, you know, a lot of atoms but it's not astronomically large. And if you try to make one molecule with that molecular formula in every three dimensional\nshape you could make with that molecular formula, it would fill 1.5 universes in volume. So with one unique molecule,\nthat's just one molecule. So chemical space is huge, and I think it's really\nimportant to recognize that, because if you wanna ask a question of, why does life emerge in chemistry? Well life emerges in chemistry because life is the physics\nof how the universe selects what gets to exist. And those things get created along historically contingent\npathways and memory and all the other stuff\nthat we can talk about. But the universe has to actually make historically contingent\nchoices in chemistry, 'cause it can't exhaust\nall possible molecules. - What kind of things can you create that's outside the combinatorial\nspace of chemistry? That's what I'm trying to understand- - Oh, if it's not chemical. So I think some of the things that have evolved on our biosphere, I would call as much alive\nas chemistry, as a cell, but they seem much more abstract. So for example, I think language is alive. I think, or at least life. I think memes are. I think-\n- You're saying language is life? - Yes.\n- Language is alive. Oh boy, I'm gonna have\nto explore that one. (Sara laughs) Okay, but-\n- Life, maybe not alive, but I don't... Actually, I don't know where\nI stand exactly on that. I've been thinking about that\na little bit more lately. But mathematics too, and it's interesting, 'cause people think that math\nhas this platonic reality that exists outside of our universe. And I think it's a\nfeature of our biosphere, and it's telling us something about the structure of ourselves. And I find that really interesting, 'cause when you would sort of internalize all of these things that\nwe noticed about the world and you start asking, \"Well,\nwhat do these look like if I was, you know,\nsomething outside of myself, observing these systems\nthat all embedded in, what would that structure look like?\" And I think we look really different than the way that we talk about what we look like to each other. - What do you think a\nliving organism in math is? Is it one axiomatic system or is it individual theorems or is it- - I think it's the fact that\nit's open-ended in some sense. It's another open-ended\ncombinatorial space. And the recursive properties of it allow creativity to happen. Which is what you see with, you know, like the revolution in the last century with Godel's theorem\nand Turing and you know, there's clear places where mathematics notices\nholes in the universe. - So it seems like you're sneaking up on a different kind of definition of life. Open-ended, large combinatorial space. - Yeah.\n- Room for creativity. - Definitely not chemical. I mean chemistry is one substrate.\n- Restrict to chemical. - Yeah.\n- Chemical. Okay, what about the third thing, which I think would be the hardest, 'cause you probably like\nit the most, is evolution or selection. - Well, specifically\nit's Darwinian evolution. - Darwinian, okay.\n- And I think Darwinian evolution is a problem. But the reason that that\ndefinition is a problem is not because evolution\nis in the definition, but because the implication\nis that, you know, that most people would wanna make is that an individual is alive. And the evolutionary process, at least the Darwinian\nevolutionary process and most evolutionary processes, they don't happen at the\nlevel of individuals, they happen at the level of population. So again, you would be saying something, like what we saw with the\nself-sustaining definition, which is that populations are alive, but individuals aren't, because populations evolve\nand individuals don't. And obviously like maybe you are alive because you know, your gut\nmicrobiome is evolving. But Lex as an entity\nright now is not evolving by canonical theories of evolution. In assembly theory, which is attempting to explain life, evolution is a much broader thing, so- - So an individual organism can evolve under assembly theory. - Yes, you're constructing\nyourself all the time. Assembly theory is about construction and how the universe\nselects for things to exist. - What if you reformulate everything? Like a population is\na living organism, so- - That's fine too.\n- Right. - But this again gets back to... So I think what all of the... You know, like we can\nnitpick at definitions. I don't think it's like\nincredibly helpful to do it. But the reason for me-\n- It's fun. - Yeah, it is fun. It is really fun. And actually I do think it's useful, in the sense that when you see the ways that they all break down, you either have to keep forcing in, your like sort of conception\nof life you want to have, or you have to say, \"All these definitions are\nbreaking down for a reason. Maybe I should adopt a\nmore expansive definition that encompasses all the things\nthat I think and our life.\" And so for me, I think life is the process of how information structures\nmatter over time and space, and an example of life is\nwhat emerges on a planet and yields an open-ended cascade\nof generation of structure and increasing complexity, and this is the thing that life is. And any individual is\njust a particular instance of these lineages that are, you know, structured across time. And so we focus so much\non these individuals that are these short temporal moments in this larger causal structure that actually is the life on our planet. And I think that's why these\ndefinitions break down, because they're not general enough, they're not universal enough,\nthey're not deep enough, they're not abstract enough to actually capture that regularity. - Because we're focused on\nthat little ephemeral thing. - Yeah, it's like-\n- That we call human life? - Aristotle focusing on, you know, heavy things falling\nbecause they're earth-like, and you know, things floating\n'cause they're airlike, it's the wrong thing to focus on."

      "section": "Time and space",
      "text": "- So what exactly are we missing by focusing on such a short span of time? - I think we're missing\nmost of what we are. So one of the issues, I've been thinking about this like really viscerally lately, it's weird when you do\ntheoretical physics, because I think it like literally changes the structure of your brain, (laughs) and you see the world differently, especially when you're trying\nto build new abstractions. - Do you think it's possible, if you're a theoretical physicist, that like it's easy to fall off the cliff and go descend into madness? - I mean I think you're\nalways on the edge of it, but I think what is amazing\nabout being a scientist and trying to do things rigorously,\nis it keeps your sanity. So I think if I wasn't\na theoretical physicist, I would be probably not sane, but what it forces you\nto do is hold the... Like you have to hold\nyourself to the fire of like, these abstractions in my mind have to really correspond to reality, and I have to really\ntest that all the time. And so I love building new abstractions and I love going to those\nlike incredibly creative, you know, spaces that people don't see as part of the way that we\nunderstand the world now. But ultimately, I have to make sure that whatever I'm pulling from that space is something that's really usable and really like relates to\nthe world outside of me. That's what science is. - So we were talking about what we're missing when we\nlook at a small stretch of time in a small stretch of space. - Yeah. So the issue is, we evolve perception to see reality a certain way, right? So for us, space is really important and time feels fleeting and I, you know, I had a really wonderful\nmentor, Paul Davies, most of my career. And Paul's amazing because\nhe gives these like little seed thought\nexperiments all the time. Like, you know, something\nhe used to ask me all the time when I was a postdoc, this is kind of a random tangent, but was like, you know,\nhow much of the universe could be converted into technology? If you were thinking about like, you know, long-term futures and stuff like that. And it's like a weird thought experiment but like, there's a lot\nof deep things there. But I do think a lot about the fact that, we're really limited in our\ninteractions with reality by the particular\narchitectures that we evolved, and so we're not seeing everything. And in fact our technology\ntells us this all the time because it allows us to\nsee the world in new ways by basically allowing\nus to perceive the world in ways that we couldn't otherwise. And so what I'm getting at with this is, I think that living\nobjects are actually huge. Like there're some of\nthe biggest structures in the universe, but they\nare not big in space, they're big in time. And we actually can't\nresolve that feature. We don't interact with\nit on a regular basis. So we see them as these fleeting things that have this really\nshort temporal clock time without seeing how large they are. When I'm saying time here, I really like the way that\npeople could picture it is in terms of causal structure. So if you think about the\nhistory of the universe to get to you, and you imagine that that\nentire history is you, that is the picture I have in my mind when I look at every living thing. - So you have a tweet for everything. (Sara laughs)\nYou tweeted- - Doesn't everyone? - You have a lot of\npoetic, profound tweets. Sometimes-\n- Thank you. - They're puzzles that take\na long time to figure out. - Well you know what the trick is, the reason they're hard to write is because it's compressing\na very deep idea into a short amount of space, and I really like doing\nthat intellectual exercise, 'cause I find it productive for me. - Yeah, it's a very\ninteresting kind of compression algorithm though. - Yeah, I like language. I think it's really fun to play with. - Yeah, I wonder if AI can decompress it. That'd be interesting- - I would like to try this, but I think I use language in certain ways that are non-canonical, and\nI do it very purposefully, and it would be interesting to\nme how AI would interpret it. - Yeah, your tweets would\nbe a good Turing test. - There you go.\n- For a super intelligence. Anyway, you tweeted that,\n\"Things only look emergent because we can't see time. So if we could see time, what\nwould the world look like?\" You're saying you would\nbe able to see everything that an object has been, every step of the way that\nled to this current moment, and all the interactions that are required to make that evolution happen. You would see this gigantic tale. - The universe is far larger\nin time than it is in space. - Yeah.\n- And this planet is one of the biggest\nthings in the universe. - Oh, so the more complexity, the bigger- - Yeah, so like the technosphere, I think the modern technosphere is the largest object in time in the universe that we know about. - And when you say\ntechnosphere, what do you mean? - I mean the global integration of life and technology on this planet. - So all the things, all the technological\nthings we've created? - Mm-hmm, but I don't\nthink of them as separate. They're like very integrated with the structure that generated them. So you can almost imagine it, like time is constantly bifurcating, and it's generating new structures, and these new structures are, you know, locally constructing the future. And so things like you and I are very close together in time, 'cause we didn't diverge like very early in the history of\nuniverse, it's very recent. And I think this is one of the reasons that we can understand each other so well and we can communicate effectively. And I might have some sense of\nwhat it feels like to be you, but you know, other\norganisms bifurcated from us in time earlier, this is just the concept\nof phylogeny, right? But if you take that deeper and you really think about that as the structure of the\nphysics that generates life, and you take that very seriously, all of that causation is still bundled up in the objects we observe today. And so you and I are are close\nin this temporal structure, but we're also... And we're so close\nbecause we're really big, and we only are very different in sort of like the most\nrecent moments in the time that's like embedded in us. It's hard to use words to visualize what's in minds. (laughs) I have such a hard time\nwith this sometimes. I'm like, I like... I actually was thinking\non the way over here, I was like, you know, you\nhave pictures in your brain and then they're hard to put into words, but I realized I always\nsay I have a visual, but it's not actually I have a visual. It's, I have a feeling, 'cause oftentimes I cannot\nactually draw a picture in my mind for the things that I say, but sometimes they go through a picture before they get to words, but I like experimenting with words because I think they help paint pictures. - Yeah, it's again, some\nkind of compressed feeling that you can query to get a sense of the bigger visualization that you have in mind. - Yeah.\n- It's just like a really nice compression. But I think the idea of this object that in it contains all the\ninformation about the history of an entity that you see now, just trying to visualize\nthat is pretty cool. - Yeah.\n- I mean obviously the mind breaks down\nquickly as you step seconds and minutes back in time.\n- Yeah, for sure - I guess it's just a gigantic object- - Yeah.\n- What you're supposed to be thinking about. - Yeah, I think so, and I think this is one of the reasons that we have such an ability\nto abstract as humans, because we are so gigantic, that like the space\nthat we can go back into is really large. So like the more abstract you're going, like the deeper you're\ngoing in that space. - But in that sense, aren't we\nfundamentally all connected? - Yes, and this is why\nthe definition of life cannot be the individual, it has to be these lineages, because they're all\nconnected, they're interwoven, and they're exchanging parts all the time. - Yeah, so maybe there's certain\naspects of those lineages that can be lifelike, they\ncan be characteristics, they can be measured like with\nassembly theory that have- - Yeah.\n- More or less life, but they're all just fingertips of a- - Yeah.\n- Of a much bigger object. - Yeah, I think life is\nvery high dimensional. And in fact I think you can\nbe alive in some dimensions and not in others. Like if you could\nproject all the causation that's in you in some\nfeatures of you, you know, very little causation is required,\nlike very little history, and in some features a lot is. So it's quite difficult to take this really high\ndimensional, very deep structure, and project it into things\nthat we really can understand and say like, \"This is the\none thing that we're seeing,\" because it's not one thing. - It's funny, we're talking about this now and I'm slowly starting to realize, one of the things I saw\nwhen I took ayahuasca, afterwards actually, so the actual ceremony\nis four or five hours, but afterwards you're still riding whatever the thing that you're riding. And I got a chance to, afterwards, hang out with some friends and just shoot the shit in\nthe, you know, in the forest. And I get to see their faces. And what was happening with their faces and their hair is, I would\nget this interesting effect. First of all, everything was beautiful and I just had so much love for everybody. But I could see their past\nselves like behind them. It was this effect where... I guess it's a blurring effect? Of where like if I move like this, the faces that were just\nthere are still there and it would just float like this, behind them, which will\ncreate this incredible effect. But it's also another way\nto think about that is, I'm visualizing a little\nbit of that object, of the thing they were\njust a few seconds ago. - Yeah.\n- It's a cool little effect. - That's very cool. - And now it's like giving\nit a bit more profundity to the effect that was just\nbeautiful aesthetically, but it's also beautiful\nfrom a physics perspective, because that is a past self. I get a little glimpse at the past selves that they were, but then you take that to its natural conclusion,\nnot just a few seconds ago, but just to the beginning of the universe, and you can probably get to that-\n- Yeah, billions of years, yeah.\n- Get down that lineage. - It's crazy that\nthere's billions of years inside all of us. - All of us.\n- Yeah. - And then we connect obviously. - Yeah.\n- Not too long ago. - Yeah."

      "text": "- You mentioned just the technosphere and you also wrote that, \"The most alive thing on this planet is our technosphere.\" - Yeah.\n- Why is the technology we create a kind of life form? Why are you seeing it as life? - Because it's creative, but with us obviously, like\nnot independently of us, and also because of this\nsort of lineage view of life, and I think about life often as a planetary scale phenomena, 'cause that's sort of the natural boundary for all of this causation that's bundled in every object in our biosphere. And so for me, it's just\nsort of the current boundary of how far life on our planet has pushed into the things that our\nuniverse can generate. And so it's the furthest\nthing, it's the biggest thing. And I think a lot about the nature of life across different scales. And so, you know, we have cells\ninside of us that are alive and we feel like we're alive, but we don't often think\nabout the societies that we're embedded in as alive or a global scale organization of us and our technology on the planet as alive. But I think if you have this deeper view into the nature of life, which I think is necessary also\nto solve the origin of life, then you have to include those things. - All of them. So you have to simultaneously think about- - Every scale\n- Life at every single scale. - Yeah.\n- The planetary and the bacteria level. - Yeah, this is the hard thing about solving the problem of life, I think, is how many things you have to integrate into building a sort of a unified picture of this thing that we wanna call life, and a lot of our theories of physics are built on building deep regularities that explain a really\nbroad class of phenomenon. And I think we haven't\nreally traditionally thought about life that\nway, but I think to get at some of these hardest questions, like looking for life on other planets or the origin of life, you really have to\nthink about it that way. And so most of like my professional work is just trying to understand\nlike every single thing on this planet that might\nbe an example of life, which is pretty much everything, and then trying to figure out like, what's the deeper\nstructure underlying that. - Yeah, Schrodinger wrote that, \"Living matter, while not\neluding the laws of physics as established up to date, is likely to involve other laws of physics hitherto unknown.\" So to him- - I love that quote. - There was a sense that, at the bottom of this\nare new laws of physics that could explain this\nthing that we call life. - Yeah, Schrodinger really tried to do what physicists try to do, which is explain things, and his attempt was to try to explain life in terms of non-equilibrium physics, because he thought that\nwas the best description that we could generate at the time. And so he did come up with\nsomething really insightful, which was to predict the structure of DNA as an aperiodic crystal. And that was for a very\nprecise reason that, you know, that was the only kind\nof physical structure that could encode enough information to actually specify a cell. We knew some things about\ngenes, but not about DNA and its actual structure\nwhen he proposed that. But in the book he tried to explain, life is kind of going against entropy. And so some people talked about it as like Schrodinger's paradox, how can life persist when the second law of\nthermodynamics is there? But in open systems\nthat's not so problematic. And really, the question is, why can life generate so much order? And we don't have a\nphysics to describe that. And it's interesting, you know, generations of physicists have\nthought about this problem. Oftentimes it's like\nwhen people are retiring, they're like, \"Oh, now\nI can work on life.\" Or they're like more\nsenior in their career and they worked on other\nmore traditional problems. And there's still a lot of\nimpetus in the physics community to think that non-equilibrium\nphysics will explain life, but I think that's not the right approach. I don't think ultimately the solution to what life is is there, and I don't really think\nentropy has much to do with it unless it's entirely reformulated. - Well, because you have to\nexplain how interesting order, how complexity emerges from the soup. - Yes, from randomness. - From randomness. Physics currently can't do that."

      "section": "Theory of everything",
      "text": "- No, Physics hardly even acknowledges that the universe is random\nat its base. (laughs) We like to think we live\nin a deterministic universe and everything's deterministic. But I think that's probably, you know, an artifact of the way\nthat we've written down laws of physics since Newton\ninvented modern physics and his conception of motion\nand gravity, which, you know, he formulated laws that\nhad initial conditions and fixed dynamical laws, and that's sort of\nbecome the standard canon of how people think the universe works and how we need to describe\nany physical system, is with an initial condition\nand a law of motion. And I think that's not actually the way the universe really works. I think it's a good approximation\nfor the kind of systems that physicists have studied so far. And I think it will radically fail in the long term at describing reality at its more basal levels, but I'm not saying there's a base, I don't think that reality has a ground and I don't think there's\na theory of everything, but I think there are better theories, and I think there are\nmore explanatory theories, and I think we can get to something that explains much more than\nthe current laws of physics do. - When you say theory of everything, you mean like everything, everything. - Yeah, you know, like\nin physics right now, it's really popular to talk\nabout theories of everything. So string theory is supposed\nto be a theory of everything because it unifies quantum\nmechanics and gravity, and you know, people have their different\npet theories of everything, and the challenge with\na theory of everything, I really love this quote\nquote from David Krakauer, which is, \"A theory of everything is a theory of everything except those things that theorize.\" - Oh, you mean removing the\nobserver from the thing? - Yeah, but it's also weird because if a theory of\neverything explained everything, it should also explain the theory. So the theory has to be recursive, and none of our theories\nof physics are recursive. So it's a weird concept. - Yeah, but it's very difficult to integrate the observer into a theory. - I don't think so. I think you can build\na theory acknowledging that you're an observer\ninside the universe, - But doesn't it become\nrecursive in that way? And you're saying it's\npossible to make a theory that's okay with that? - I think so. I mean, I don't think... There's always gonna be the paradox of another meta level you could build on the meta level, right? So like if you assume\nthis is your universe and you're the observer outside of it, you have some meta\ndescription of that universe, but then you need a meta description of you describing that universe, right? So, you know, this is one\nof the biggest challenges that we face being observers\ninside our universe. And also, you know, why the paradoxes and the foundations of mathematics and any place that we try to\nhave observers in the system or a system describing itself show up. But I think it is possible\nto build a physics that builds in those things intrinsically, without having them be paradoxical or have holes in the descriptions. And so one place I think\nabout this quite a lot, which I think can give you sort\nof a more concrete example, is the nature of like\nwhat we call fundamental. So we typically define\nfundamental right now in terms of the smallest\nindivisible units of matter. So again, you have to have a definition of what you think material\nis, and matter is, but right now the, you know, what's fundamental are\nelementary particles, and we think they're fundamental, because we can't break them apart further, and obviously we have\ntheories like string theory that if they're right, would\nreplace the current description of what's the most fundamental\nthing in our universe by replacing it with something smaller, but we can't get to those theories, because we're technologically limited. And so if you look at this\nfrom a historical perspective and you think about explanations changing as physical systems like us learn more about the\nreality in which they live, we once considered atoms to\nbe the most fundamental thing. And you know, it literally\ncomes from the word indivisible. And then we realized\natoms had substructure because we built better technology, which allowed us to quote\nunquote, \"see the world better,\" and resolve smaller features of it. And then we built even better technology, which allowed us to see\neven smaller structure and get down to the\nstandard model particles. And we think that there might\nbe structure below that, but we can't get there\nyet with our technology. So what's fundamental, the way we talk about\nit in current physics is not actually fundamental. It's the boundaries of what we\ncan observe in our universe, what we can see with our technology. And so if you wanna build\na theory that's about us and about what's inside the universe that we can observe, not\nwhat's at the boundary of it, you need to talk about objects\nthat are in the universe, that you can actually break\napart to smaller things. So I think the things that are fundamental are actually the constructed objects. They're the ones that really exist and you really understand\ntheir properties, because you know how the\nuniverse constructed them, because you can actually take them apart. You can understand the\nintrinsic laws that built them, but the things at the boundary\nare just at the boundary, they're evolving with us, and we'll learn more about\nthat structure as we go along. But really, if we wanna talk\nabout what's fundamental inside our universe, we have to talk about all these things that are traditionally\nconsidered emergent, but are really just structures in time that have causal histories\nthat constructed them, and you know, are really actually what our universe is about. - So we should focus on the construction methodology\nas the fundamental thing. But do you think there's a bottom to the smallest possible thing\nthat makes up the universe? - I don't see one. - And it'll take way too long. It'll take longer to find that, than it will to understand the\nmechanism that created life. - I think so, yeah. I think for me, the\nfrontier in modern physics, where the new physics lies, is not in high energy particle physics, it's not in quantum gravity, it's not in any of these\nsort of traditionally sold, \"This is gonna be the\nnewest, deepest insight we have into the nature of reality.\" It is going to be in studying\nthe problems of life, and intelligence, and the\nthings that are sort of also our current existential\ncrises as a civilization or a culture that's\ngoing through, you know, an existential trauma of\ninventing technologies that we don't understand right now. - The existential trauma, and the terror we feel\nthat that technology might somehow destroy us, us meaning living,\nintelligent living organisms- - Right.\n- And yet we don't understand what that even means. - Well, humans have always been afraid of our technologies though, right? So it's kind of a fascinating thing that every time we invent\nsomething we don't understand, it takes us a little\nwhile to catch up with it. - I think also in part, humans\nkind of love being afraid. - Yeah, we love being traumatized. - It's weird, the drama.\n- We wanna learn more, and then when we learn more\nit traumatizes us. (laughs) (Lex laughs) You know, I never thought\nabout this before, but I think this is one of\nthe reasons I love what I do is because it traumatizes\nme all the time. (laughs) That sounds really bad, but what I mean is like, I love\nthe shock of like realizing that like coming to understand something in a way that you never\nunderstood it before. I think it seems to me, when I see a lot of the ways other people react to new ideas, that they don't feel\nthat way intrinsically. But for me that's like... That's why I do what I do. I love that feeling. - But you're also working on a topic where it's fundamentally ego destroying, because you're talking about like life. It's humbling to think that we're not... The individual human is not special. - Yeah.\n- And you're like very viscerally exploring that. - Yeah, I'm trying to embody that. I think you have to live the\nphysics to understand it. But there's a great quote about Einstein, I don't know if this is true or not, that he once said that\nhe could feel light beam in his belly. And I think...\n(both chuckle) But I think like, you gotta\nthink about it though, right? Like if you're a really deep thinker, and you're really thinking\nabout reality that deeply, and you are part of the reality that you're trying to describe, like you feel it, you really feel it. - That's what I was saying about, you're always like\nwalking along the cliff, and if you fall off, you're\nfalling into madness. - Yes, it's a constant,\nconstant descent into madness. - The fascinating thing about physicists and madness is that you don't know if you've fallen off the cliff. - Yeah, I know. You don't know. - That's the cool thing about that.\n- I rely on other people to tell me. Actually this is very funny, 'cause like I have these conversations with my students often, like they're worried about\ngoing crazy, (laughs) and I have to like reassure them that like one of the\nreasons they'll stay sane is by trying to work on concrete problems. - Going crazy or waking up? I don't know which one it is.\n- Yeah."

      "section": "Origin of life",
      "text": "- So what do you think is\nthe origin of life on Earth, and how can we talk about\nit in a productive way? - The origin of life is like this boundary that the universe can only cross if a structure that emerges can\nreinforce its own existence, which is self reproduction,\nauto catalysis, things people traditionally talk about. But it has to be able to maintain its own existence against this sort of randomness\nthat happens in chemistry, and this randomness that\nhappens in the quantum world. And like it's in some sense, the emergence of like a\ndeterministic structure that says, you know, \"I'm gonna exist and\nI'm gonna keep going.\" But you know, pinning\nthat down is really hard. We have ways of thinking\nabout it in assembly theory that I think are pretty rigorous, and one of the things\nI'm really excited about is trying to actually quantify in an assembly theoretic way when the origin of life happens. But the basic process I have in mind is like a system that has no causal contingency,\nno constraints of objects, basically constraining the\nexistence of other objects or allowing the existence\nof other objects. And so that sounds very abstract, but like you can just think\nof like a chemical reaction can't happen if there's not\na catalyst, for example. Or a baby can't be born\nif there wasn't a parent. So there's a lot of causal contingency that's necessary for\ncertain things to happen. So you think about this sort\nof unconstrained random system, there's nothing that reinforces the existence of other things. So the sort of resources\njust get washed out in all of these different structures, and none of them exist again. Or they just, you know... They're not very complicated\nif they're in high abundance, and some random events allow some things to start reinforcing the existence of a small subset of objects. And if they can do that, you know, like just molecules basically\nrecognizing each other and being able to catalyze\ncertain reactions. There's this kind of\ntransition point that happens, where unless you get a\nself-reinforcing structure, something that can\nmaintain its own existence, it actually can't cross this boundary to make any objects in high abundance without having this sort of past history that it's carrying with us, and maintaining the existence\nof that past history, and that boundary point\nwhere objects can't exist unless they have the\nselection and history in them, is what we call the origin of life. And pretty much everything\nbeyond that boundary, is holding on for dear life\nto all of the causation and causal structure that's\nbasically put it there, and it's carving its way\nthrough this possibility space into generating more and more structure, and that's when you get the\nopen-ended cascade of evolution. But that boundary point\nis really hard to cross, and then what happens when\nyou cross that boundary point and the way objects come into existence is also like really fascinating dynamics, because you know, like as\nthings become more complex, the assembly index increases. I can explain all these things, sorry. You can tell me what you want explained. (Sara laughs) Or what people will wanna hear. Sorry, I have like a very\nvivid visual in my brain and it's really hard to articulate it. - Gotta convert it to language. - I know, it's so hard.\n(Sara laughs) It's like, it's going from like a feeling, to a visual, to language,\nis so stifling sometimes. - And then I have to convert it- - Yeah.\n- From language to a visual. - Yeah.\n- To a feeling. - Yeah.\n- I think it's working. - I hope so.\n- I really like the self-reinforcing objects. I mean, just so-\n- Yeah. - Just so I understand, one way to create a lot\nof the same kind of object is make them self reinforcing. - Yes, so self reproduction\nhas its property, right? Like if that system can make itself, then it can persist in time, right? Because all objects decay, they\nall have a finite lifetime. So if you're able to make a\ncopy of yourself before you die, before the second law eats you or whatever people think happens, then that structure can persist in time. - So that's a way to sort of\nemerge out of a random soup. Outta the randomness of soup.\n- Yes. Right, but things that can\ncopy themselves are very rare. - Yeah.\n- And so what ends up happening is that you get structures that enable the existence of other things, and then somehow, only\nfor some sets of objects, you get closed structures\nthat are self-reinforcing, and allow that entire\nstructure to persist. - Right, so the one... Object A reinforces the\nexistence of object B, but you know, object A can die. - Yeah.\n- So you have to like close that loop. - [Sara] Right, so this is the classic- - And it's just all very\nunlikely statistically, but you know, that's-\n- Right. - Sufficiently... So you're saying there's a chance. - There is a chance.\n- It's low probability but once you solve that,\nonce you close the loop, you can create a lot of those objects. - And that's what we're\ntrying to figure out, is what are the causal\nconstraints that close the loop. So there is this idea that's\nbeen in the literature for a really long time, that was originally\nproposed by Stuart Kauffman as really critical to the origin life called autocatalytic sets. So autocatalytic set is\nexactly this property. We have A makes B, B makes C, C makes A, and you get a closed system. But the problem with the\ntheory of autocatalytic sets is incredibly brittle as a theory and it requires a lot\nof ad hoc assumptions. Like you have to assume function, you have to say, \"This thing makes B,\" it's not an emergent property, the association between A and B. And so the way I think about\nit is much more general, if you think about these\nhistories that make objects, it's kind of like the structure\nof the histories becomes... Collapses in such a way that these things are all in the same sort of causal structure, and that causal structure\nactually loops back on itself to be able to generate some of the things that make the higher level structures. Lee has a beautiful example of\nthis actually in molybdenum. It's like the first\nnon-organic autocatalytic set. It's a self reproducing molybdenum ring, but it's like molybdenum and basically like if you\nlook at the molybdenum, it makes a huge molybdenum ring. I don't remember exactly how big it is, it might be like 150\nmolybdenum atoms or something. But if you think about\nthe configuration space of that object, you know,\nit's exponentially large, how many possible molecules? So like why does the\nentire system collapse on just making that one structure? If you start from like,\nyou know, molybdenum atoms that are maybe just like a\ncouple of them stuck together. And so what they see in this system is there's a few intermediate stages. So there's like some random events where the chemistry comes\ntogether, makes these structures, and then once you get\nto this very large one, it becomes a template\nfor the smaller ones, and then the whole system just reinforces its own production. - How did Lee find this molybdenum (both chuckle) closed loop. - If I knew how Lee's brain worked, I think I would understand\nmore about the universe, but I- - [Lex] This is not an algorithmic\ndiscovery, it's a like- - No, but I think it goes to\nthe deepest roots of like, when he started thinking\nabout origins of life. So I like, I mean I don't\nknow all his history, but like what he's told me is, he started out in crystallography, and you know, there's some\nthings that he would just... You know, like people\nwould just take for granted about chemical structures that he was like deeply perplexed about. Like just like why are\nthese like really intricate, really complex structures forming so easily under these conditions? And he was really interested in life, but he started in that field. So he's just carried with him these sort of deep\ninsights from these systems that seem like they're totally not alive, and just like these metallic chemistries, into actually thinking about\nthe deep principles of life. So I think he already knew a lot about that chemistry. And he also, you know... Assembly theory came from him thinking about how these systems work. So he had some intuition\nabout what was going on with this molybdenum ring. - The molybdenum might\nbe able to be the thing that makes a ring. - They knew about them for a long time, but they didn't know that the mechanism of why that particular structural form was autocatalytic feedback. And so that's what they\nfigured out in this paper. And I actually think that paper is revealing some of the mechanism of the origin of life transition, 'cause really what you see, like the origin of life is basically like, you should have a combinatorial explosion of this space of possible structures that are too large to exhaust. And yet you see it\ncollapse on this, you know, really small space of possibilities, that's mutually reinforcing\nitself to keep existing. That is the origin of life. - There's some set of structures that result in this\nautocatalytic feedback. - Yeah.\n- What is that? Some tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny percent? - I think it's a small space, but chemistry is very large, so- - And so like-\n- There might be a lot of them out there,\nbut we don't know. - And one of them is the thing that probably started life on Earth. - That's right.\n- Or many, many starts. - Yes.\n- And it keeps starting maybe. - Yeah. I mean there's also all kinds\nof other weird properties that happen around this\nkind of phase boundary. So this other project that I have in my lab is focused\non the origin of chirality, which is, you know, thinking about... So chirality is this property of molecules that they can come in mirror image forms. So like just like... Chiral literally means hand, so your left and right hand are what's called non-super imposable, because if you try to\nlay one on the other, you can't actually lay them\ndirectly on top of each other, and that's the property\nbeing a mirror image. So there's this sort\nof perplexing property of the chemistry life that no one's been able to\nreally adequately explain that all of the amino acids\nin proteins are left-handed, and all of the bases in RNA\nand DNA are right-handed. And yet the chemistry of\nthese building block units, the amino acids and nucleobases is the same for left and right-handed. So you have to have like some\nkind of symmetry breaking, where you go from these chemistries that seem entirely equivalent to only having one chemistry\ntake over as the dominant form. And for a long time, I had been really... I actually did my PhD on\nthe origin of chirality. I was working on it as like a symmetry breaking\nproblem in physics. This is how I got started\nin the origin of life, and then I left it for a long time, 'cause I thought it was like one of the most boring\nproblems in the origin of life, but I've come back it, 'cause I think there's something\nreally deep going on here related to this like\ncombinatorial explosion of the space of possibilities. But just to get to that point, like this feature of this handedness has been the main focus, but people take for granted the existence of chiral molecules at all, that this property of having a handedness. And they just assume that, you know, like it's just a generic\nfeature of chemistry. But if you actually look at molecules, if you look at chemical space, which is like the space\nof all possible molecules that people can generate, and you look at small molecules, things that have less than\nabout seven to 11 heavy atoms, so things that are not hydrogen. Almost every single molecule\nin that space is achiral, like doesn't have a chiral center. So it would be like a spoon. A spoon doesn't have a... Like it's the same as its mirror image. It's not like a hand that's\ndifferent than its mirror image. But if you get to like\nthis threshold boundary, above that boundary, almost\nevery single molecule is chiral. So you go from a universe where almost nothing\nhas a mirror image form. There's no mirror image\nuniverse of possibilities, to this one where every single structure has pretty much a mirror image version. And what we've been looking at in my lab is that it seems to be the case that the origin of life transition happens around the time when you\nstart accumulating... You push your molecules to\na large enough complexity that chiral molecules\nbecome very likely to form, and then there's a cascade\nof molecular recognition where chiral molecules\ncan recognize each other, and then you get this sort\nof autocatalytic feedback and things self-reinforcing. - So is chirality in itself\nan interesting feature or just an accident? - No, it's a super interesting feature. I think chirality breaks\nsymmetry in time not space. So we think of it as a spatial property, like a left and right hand, but if I choose the left hand, I'm basically choosing\nthe future of that system, for all time, because I've\nbasically made a choice between the ways that that\nmolecule can now react with every other object\nin its chemical universe. - Oh, I see.\n- And so you're actually... Like when you have this\nsplitting of making a molecule that now has\nanother form it could have had, by the same exact atomic composition, but now it's just a mirror image isometry, you're basically splitting\nthe universe of possibilities every time. - Yeah, in two.\n- In two, but molecules can have more\nthan one chiral center, and that's not the only\nsymmetry that they can have. So this is one of the reasons that Taxol fills 1.5 universes of space. It's all of these spatial permutations that you do on these objects that actually makes the space so huge. So the point of this\nsort of chiral transition that I'm putting out is, chirality is actually a signature of being in a complex chemical space. And the fact that we think\nit's a really generic feature of chemistry and it's really prevalent, is because most of the\nchemistry we study on Earth is a product already of life. And it also has to do with\nthis transition in assembly, this transition in possibility spaces, because I think there's\nsomething really fundamental going on at this boundary, that you don't really need to go that far into chemical space if you can... To actually see life in\nterms of this depth in time, this depth in symmetries of objects, in terms of like chiral symmetries, or this assembly structure. But getting past this boundary that's not very deep in\nthat space requires life. It's a really weird property, and it's really weird that\nso many abrupt things happen in chemistry at that same scale. - So would that be the\ngreatest invention ever made on Earth in its evolutionary history? So I really like that formulation of it. Nick Lane has a book\ncalled, \"Life Ascending,\" where he lists the 10 great\ninventions of evolution, the origin of life being first, and DNA, the hereditary material that encodes the genetic instructions for all living organisms. Then photosynthesis, the\nprocess that allows organisms to convert sunlight into chemical energy, producing oxygen as a byproduct. The complex cell, eukaryotic cells, which contain a nucleus and organelles, arose from simple bacterial cells. Sex, sexual reproduction. Movement, so just the ability to move, under which you have the predation, the predators and ability\nof living organisms- - Oh, I like that movement's\n- To find food. - In there, that's cool. - Yeah, but movement includes a lot of interesting stuff in there, like predator prey dynamic. - Right.\n- Which, not to romanticize, nature is metal. That seems like an important one. I don't know. It's such a computationally powerful thing to have a predator and prey. - Well, it's efficient for things to eat other things\nthat are already alive, 'cause they don't have\nto go all the way back to the base chemistry. - Well that, but maybe\nI just like deadlines, but it creates an urgency. You're gonna get eaten. - You gotta live. - Yeah, like the survival. It's not just the static environment you battle against, you're like- - Yeah.\n- The dangers against which you're trying\nto survive are also evolving. This is just a much faster way to explore the space of possibilities. - I actually think it's a gift\nthat we don't have much time. - Yes. Sight, the ability to see. So the increasing complexifying\nof sensory organisms. Consciousness and death. The concept of programmed cell death. These are all inventions. - Yeah.\n- Along the line. - I like invention as a word\nfor them. I think that's good. - Which are the more\ninteresting inventions to you? Origin of life? Because you kind of are not glorifying the origin of life itself. There's a process-\n- No, I think the origin of life is a continual process, that's why. I'm interested in the first transition in solving that problem, 'cause I think it's the hardest, but I think it's happening all the time. - When you look back at\nthe history of Earth, like what are you impressed happened? - I like sight as an invention, 'cause I think having sensory perception and trying to \"comprehend the world,\" to use anthropocentric terms, is like a really critical feature of life. And I also... It's interesting the way that sight has complexified over time, right? So like if you think\nat the origin of life, nothing on the planet could see, right? So like for a long\ntime, life had no sight. And then, you know, like\nphoton receptors were invented. And then when multicellularity evolved, those cells eventually grew into eyes and we had the multicellular eye. And then it's interesting,\nwhen you get to societies, like human societies, that we invent even better\ntechnologies of seeing, like telescopes and microscopes, which allow us to see\ndeeper into the universe or at smaller scales. So I think that's pretty profound, the way that sight has\ntransformed the ability of life to literally see the reality\nin which it's existing in. I think consciousness is also obviously deeply interesting. I've gotten kind of\nobsessed with like octopus. I don't like, I... They're just so weird, and the fact that like they\nevolved complex nervous systems kind of independently is\nlike, seems very alien. - Yeah, there's a lot\nof alien like organisms. That's another thing I saw in the jungle. - Yeah.\n- Just things that are like, \"Oh, okay. They make one of those, huh?\" It just feels like there's-\n- Do you have any examples? - There's a frog that's as\nthin as a sheet of paper. - Oh wow.\n- And I was like, \"What?\" And it gives birth\nthrough like pores, like- - Oh, I've seen videos of that. It's so gross when the babies come out. - Yes.\n- Did you see that? Like in person-\n- Yes. - Like the babies coming out?\n- Oh no, no. I saw the... Without the-\n- Have you seen videos of that? It's so gross. It's one of the grossest\nthings I've ever seen. (laughs) - Well, gross is just the other\nside of beautiful I think. - Yeah.\n- 'Cause it's like, \"Oh wow, that's possible.\" - I guess if I was one of those frogs, I would think that was\nthe most beautiful event I'd ever seen. Although like human childbirth\nis not that beautiful either. (Sara laughs)\n- Yeah, it's all a matter of perspective. - Well we come into\nthe world so violently, it's just like... It's amazing. - Well, I mean the world\nis a violent place. - Yeah.\n- So again, another... It's just another side of the coin. - You know what, this actually makes me think\nof one that's not up there, which I do find really incredibly amazing, is the process of like\nthe germline cell in... You know, in organisms. Like basically like every\nliving thing on this planet at some point in its life has\nto go through a single cell, and this whole issue of like development, like the developmental\nprogram is kind of crazy. Like how do you build\nyou out of a single cell? How does a single cell\nknow how to do that? Like, you know, pattern formation of a multicellular organism, obviously like evolves with DNA. But there's a lot of stuff happening there about when cells take\non certain morphologies and things that people don't understand, like the actual shape formation mechanism. And a lot of people study that and it's... And there's a lot of advances\nbeing made now in that field. I think it's pretty shocking though that like how little we\nknow about that process. And often it's left off of people's lists. It's just kind of interesting. Embryogenesis is fascinating. - Yeah, 'cause it... You start from just one cell. - Yeah, and the genes in all\nthe cells are the same, right? So like the differentiation has to be something that's like much more about like the\nactual like, you know, expression of genes over time, and like how they get switched on and off, and also the physical environment of like the cell interacting\nwith other cells, and there's just a lot of stuff going on. - Yeah, the computation, the\nintelligence of that process- - Yes.\n- Might be like the most important thing to understand, and we just kind of don't\nreally think about it. - Right.\n- We think about the final product. - Yeah.\n- Maybe the key to understanding the organism\nis understanding that process, not the final product - Probably, yes. I think most of the things about understanding anything about what we are, are embedded in time. - [Lex] Well of course you would say that. - I know, so predictable. (laughs) It's turning into a\ndeterministic universe. - It always has been. Always was, like the meme. - Yeah, always was, but\nit won't be in the future. - Well that's... Before we talk about the future, let's talk about the\npast, the assembly theory."

      "section": "Assembly theory",
      "text": "- Yes.\n- Can you explain assembly theory to me? I listened to Lee talk\nabout it for many hours and I understood nothing. No, I'm just kidding.\n(Sara laughs) I just wanted to take another... Well, you've been\nalready talking about it, but just another-\n- Yeah. - What from a big picture view is the assembly theory way\nof thinking about our world, about our universe. - Yeah. I think the first thing is, you know, that like the observation that, life seems to be the only\nthing in the universe that builds complexity in\nthe way that we see it here, and complexity is obviously\nlike a loaded term. So I'll just use assembly instead, 'cause I think assembly is more precise. But the idea that like, you know, all the things on your desk here, from your computer, to the pen, to, you know, us sitting here, don't exist anywhere else in\nthe universe as far as we know. They only exist on this planet. And it took a long evolutionary\nhistory to get to us, is a real feature that\nwe should take seriously as one that's deeply embedded\nin the laws of physics and the structure of the\nuniverse that we live in. Standard physics would say that, you know, all of that complexity traces back to the infinitesimal deviations in like the initial state of the universe, that there was some order there. I find that deeply unsatisfactory, and what assembly theory says, that's very different, is that the universe is\nbasically constructing itself. And when you get to these\ncombinatorial spaces like chemistry, where the space of\npossibilities is too large to exhaust them all, you can only construct things along historically contingent paths. Like you basically have causal\nchains of events that happen to allow other things\nto come into existence. And that this is the way that complex objects get formed, is basically on scaffolding on\nthe past history of objects, making more complex objects, making more complex objects. That idea in itself is\neasy to state and simple, but it has some really\nradical implications as far as what you think is\nthe nature of the physics that would describe life. And so what assembly theory does formally, is try to measure the boundary in the space of all things that, you know, chemically\ncould exist, for example, like all possible molecules. Where is the boundary\nabove which we should say, \"These things are too complex to happen outside of an\nevolutionary chain of events, outside of selection.\" And we formalize that\nwith two observables, one of them is the copy\nnumber of the object. So how many of the object did you observe? And the second one is,\nwhat's the minimal number of recursive steps to make it? So if you start from\nelementary building blocks like bonds for molecules and you put them together, and then you take things\nyou've made already and built up to the object, what's the shortest number\nof steps you had to take? And what Lee's been able to\nshow in the lab with his team is that for organic chemistry,\nit's about 15 steps. And then you only see\nmolecules that, you know... Only molecules that we observe, that are past that threshold,\nare ones that are in life. And in fact, one of the\nthings I'm trying to do with this idea of like trying to actually\nquantify the origin of life as a transition in... Like a phase transition assembly theory, is actually be able to explain why that boundary is where it is, 'cause I think that's\nactually the boundary that life must cross. So the idea of going back to this thing we were talking about before about these structures that can reinforce their own existence and move past that boundary. 15 seems to be that\nboundary in chemical space. It's not a universal number. It will be different for\ndifferent assembly spaces, but that's what we've\nexperimentally validated so far, and then- - So literally 15, like\nthe assembly index is 15? - It's 15 or so for the\nexperimental data, yeah. - So that's when you start\ngetting the self-reinforcing? - That's when you have\nto have that feature in order to observe\nmolecules in high abundance in that space. - So copy number is the\nnumber of exact copies. That's what you mean by high abundance, and assembly index or the\ncomplexity of the object is how many steps it took to create it. Recursive-\n- Recursive, yeah. So you can think of objects in assembly theory as\nbasically recursive stacks of the construction steps to build them. So they're like, it's like... You take this step and then you make this object,\nand you make it this object, and make this object, and then you get up to the final object, but that object is all of that history rolled up into the current structure. - What if you took the long way home- - You can't take the long way. - Why not?\n- The long way doesn't exist. - It's a good song though. What do you mean the\nlong way doesn't exist? If I do a random walk from A to B, I'll eventually... If I start at A, I'll\neventually end up at B, and that random walk would be\nmuch longer than the short. - No, if you look at objects and you... So we define something we\ncall the assembly universe, and assembly universe is ordered in time. It's actually ordered in the causation, the number of steps to produce an object, and so all objects in the\nuniverse, are in some sense... Exist at a layer that's defined\nby their assembly index, and the size of each layer\nis growing exponentially. So what you're talking about, if you wanna look at the long\nway of getting to an object, as I'm increasing the\nassembly index of an object, I'm moving deeper and deeper into an exponentially growing space. And it's actually also the case that the sort of typical\npath to get to that object is also exponentially growing with respect to the assembly index. And so if you want to try to make a more and more complex object, and you wanna do it by a typical path, that's actually an\nexponentially receding horizon. And so most objects\nthat come into existence have to be causally very similar\nto the things that exist, 'cause they're close by in that space, and they can actually get to it by an almost shortest\npath for that object. - Yeah, the almost shortest\npath is the most likely like by a lot. - By a lot.\n- Okay. So if you see a high copy number. - Yeah, imagine yourself-\n- A copy number of greater than one. - Yeah, I mean basically we live... The more complex we get, we live in a space that is\ngrowing exponentially large, and the ways of getting to objects in the space are also\ngrowing exponentially large. And so we're this kind of recursively like stacked structure of like all of these objects that are clinging onto\neach other for existence, and then they like grab something else, and are like able to bring\nthat thing into existence, 'cause it's kind of similar to them. - But there is a phase transition. There is a- - There is a transition.\n- There is a place where you would say, \"Oh-\" - I think it's actually abrupt. I've never been able to say\nthat in my entire career before. I've always gone back and forth about whether the origin\nof life was kind of gradual or abrupt, I think it's very abrupt. - Poetically, chemically-\n- Life snaps into existence. - Oh it snaps, okay, that's very beautiful.\n- It snaps. - Okay, but-\n- We'll be poetic today. But no, I think there's like\na lot of random exploration and then there's a like... And then the possibility space just collapses on the\nstructure kind of really fast. That can reinforce its own existence, because it's basically\nfighting against non-existence. - Yeah, you tweeted, \"The\nmost significant struggle for existence in the evolutionary process is not among the objects that do exist, but between the ones that do, and those that never have the chance to. - Yeah.\n- This is where selection does most of its causal work.\" The objects that never\nget a chance to exist. - Yeah.\n- The struggle between the ones that never get a chance to\nexist and the ones that... Okay, what's that line exactly? - I don't know, we can make\nsongs out of all of these. - What are the objects that never get a chance to exist? What does that mean? - So there was this website, I forgot what it was, but it's like a neural network that just generates a human face, and it's like, \"This\nperson does not exist.\" I think that's what it's called, right? So you can just click on that all day, and you can look at people\nall day that don't exist. - Yeah.\n- All of those people exist in that space of\nthings that don't exist. - Yeah, but there's the real struggle. - Yeah, so the struggle of the quote, the struggle for existence is, you know, that goes all the way back to Darwin's writing about\nnatural selection, right? So like the whole idea of\nsurvival of the fittest is everything struggling to exist, this predator prey dynamic, and the fittest survive, and so the struggle for existence is really what selection is all about. And that's true, we do\nsee things that do exist competing to continue to exist. But each time that... Like if you think about\nthis space of possibilities and you know, each time the universe, you know, generates a new structure, or like an object that exists, generates a new structure\nalong this causal chain. It's generating something that exists, that never existed before. And each time that we make\nthat kind of decision, we're excluding a huge\nspace of possibilities. And so actually like as this process of increasing assembly index, it's not just that like the space that these objects exist in\nis exponentially growing, but there are objects in that space that are exponentially\nreceding away from us. So they're becoming exponentially less and less likely to ever exist, and so existence excludes\na huge number of things. - Just because of the accident\nof history, how it ended up. - Yeah, it is in part an accident, because I think some of the structure that gets generated is\ndriven a bit by randomness. I think a lot of it, you know, so... You know, one of the\nconceptions that we have in assembly theory is, you know, the universe\nis random at its base. You can see this in chemistry, like unconstrained chemical\nreactions are pretty random. And also quantum mechanics, you know, like there's lots of places\nthat give evidence for that. And deterministic structures emerge by things that can causally\nreinforce themselves and maintain persistence over time. And so we are some of the\nmost deterministic things in the universe. And so like we can generate\nvery regular structure, and we can generate new structure along a particular lineage. But the possibility space\nat the sort of tips, like the things we can\ngenerate next is really huge. So there's some stochasticity\nin what we actually, you know, instantiate as like the next structures that get built in the biosphere. It's not completely deterministic, 'cause the space of future possibilities is always larger than the\nspace of things that exist now. - So how many instantiations\nof life is out there, do you think? So how often does this happen? What we see happen here on Earth? How often is this process repeated throughout our galaxy,\nthroughout the universe? - So I said before, like right now, I think the origin of life is\na continuous process on Earth. Like, I think this idea of\nlike combinatorial spaces that our biosphere generates,\nnot just chemistry, but other spaces, often\ncross this threshold where they then allow themselves to persist with particular\nregular structure over time. So language is another\none where, you know, like the space of, you know,\npossible configurations of the 26 letters of the English alphabet is astronomically large, but we use with very high\nregularity, certain structures. And then we associate meaning to them because of the regularity of like how much we use them, right? So meaning is an emergent\nproperty of the causation and the objects and like\nhow often they recur, and what the relationship\nof the recurrence is to other objects. - Meaning is the emergent property. Okay, got it.\n- Well this is why you can play with\nlanguage so much actually. So words don't really carry meaning, it's just about how\nyou lace them together. - Yeah, but from where does the- - But you don't have a lot of room... Obviously, as a speaker\nof a given language, you don't have a lot of room\nwith a given word to wiggle. But you have a certain amount of room to push the meanings of words. - Yeah.\n- And I do this all the time and you have to do it with\nthe kind of work that I do. Because if you want to\ndiscover an abstraction, like some kind of concept that we don't understand yet, it means we don't have the language. And so the words that we have are inadequate to describe the things. This is why we're having a hard time talking about assembly theory, 'cause it's a newly emerging idea. And so I'm constantly playing with words in different ways to try\nto convey the meaning that is actually behind the words, but it's hard to do. - So you have to wiggle\nwithin the constraints. - Yes, lots of wiggle. - The great orators are\njust good at wiggling. - Do you wiggle? (laughs) - I'm not a very good wiggler, no. This is the problem. This\nis part of the problem. - No, I like playing with words a lot. You know, it's very funny 'cause you know, like I know you talked\nabout this with Lee, but like, people were so offended by the writing of the paper\nthat came out last fall, and it was interesting because the ways that we use words were not the way that\npeople were interacting with the words. And I think that was part of the mismatch, where we were trying to\nuse words in a new way, 'cause we were trying to describe\nsomething that, you know, hadn't been described adequately before. But we had to use the words\nthat everyone else uses for things that are related, and so it was really interesting to watch that clash play out in real time, for me, being someone that tries to be so precise with my word usage, knowing\nthat it's always gonna be vague. - Boy, can I relate. It's like, what is truth? Is truth the thing you meant\nwhen you wrote the words? Or is truth the thing\nthat people understood when they read the words? - Oh yeah.\n- I think that compression mechanism into language is a really interesting one, and that's why Twitter is a nice exercise- - I love Twitter.\n- You get to write a thing, and you think a certain\nthing when you write it, and then you get to see all\nthese other people interpret it all kinds of different ways. - I use it as an experimental\nplatform for that reason. - I wish there was a higher diversity of interpretation mechanisms\napplied to tweets. Meaning like-\n- Oh. - All kinds of different\npeople would come to it. Like some people that see\nthe good in everything and some people that are ultra cynicals. - Yeah.\n- A bunch of haters and a bunch of lovers and a bunch of- - Maybe they could do better jobs with presenting material to people. Like, you know, they ran like... How things, you know, it's\nlike usually based on interest, but I think it would be\nreally nice if you got like, 10% of your Twitter feed was random stuff sampled from other places,\nthat'd be kind of fun. - True. I also would love to\nfilter, just like bin, the response to tweets by like the people that\nhate on everything. - Yes.\n- The people that are- - Oh, that would be fantastic. - The people that are like\nsuper positive about everything, and then that'll just kind of, I guess, normalize the response. - Yeah.\n- Because then it'd be cool to see if the people that are usually\npositive about everything are hating on you, or like totally don't understand, or completely misunderstood. - Yeah, usually takes a lot\nof clicking to find that out. Yeah, so it'd be better\nif it was sorted, yeah. - The more clicking you do, the more damaging it is to the soul.\n- Yeah. It's like instead of like... Like you could have the blue check, but you should have like, are\nyou a pessimist, an optimist? - There's a lot of-\n- Chaotic neutral? (laughs) - A whole rainbow of checks. And then you realize\nthere's more categories than we can possibly express in colors. - Yeah, of course. People are complex. - That's our best feature."

      "section": "Aliens",
      "text": "I don't know how we got\nto the wiggling required, given the constraints of language, because I think we started about\nme asking about alien life, which is, how many different times did the phase transition happen elsewhere? Do you think there's other\nalien civilizations out there? - This goes into like the, you know, like are you on the\nboundary of insane or not? But you know, when you\nthink about the structure of the physics of what we are that deeply, it really changes your\nconception of things. And you know, going to\nthis idea of the universe, you know, being kind of\nsmall in physical space compared to how big it is in\ntime and like how large we are. It really makes me question about whether there's any other structure that's like this giant crystal in time, this giant causal structure, like our biosphere/technosphere is, anywhere else in the universe. - Why not?\n- I don't know. - Just because this one is gigantic doesn't mean there's\nno other gigantic ones- - Right, but I think when the\nuniverse is expanding, right? It's expanding in space, but in assembly theory it's\nalso expanding in time. And actually that's driving\nthe expansion in space, and expansion in time is\nalso driving the expansion in the sort of combinatorial\nspace of things on our planet. So that's driving the sort of, you know, pace of technology and\nall the other things. So time is driving all of these things, which is a little bit crazy to think that the universe is just getting bigger because time is getting bigger. But like this sort of visual that gets built in my brain about that is like this structure that we're building on this planet is packing more and more time in this very small volume of space, right? 'Cause our planet hasn't\nchanged its physical size in 4 billion years, but there's like a ton of\ncausation and recursion and time, whatever word you wanna use, information, packed into this. And I think this is also, you know, embedded in sort of the\nvirtualization of our technologies or the abstraction of language and all of these things, these things that seem really abstract are just really deep in time. And so what that looks like is, you have a planet that becomes\nincreasingly virtualized, and so it's getting\nbigger and bigger in time, but not really expanding out in space, and the rest of space is like\nkind of moving away from it. Again, it's a sort of\nexponentially receding horizon. And I'm just not sure how far into this evolutionary\nprocess something gets, if it can ever see that there's another\nsuch structure out there. - What do you mean by\nvirtualized in that context? - Virtual as sort of a\nplay on virtual reality and like simulation theories, but virtual also in a sense of, you know, we talk about virtual\nparticles in particle physics, which, you know, they are very critical to doing calculations about\npredicting the properties of real particles, but we\ndon't observe them directly. So what I mean by virtual here is, virtual reality for me, things that appear\nvirtual, appear abstract, are just things that\nare very deep in time, in the structure of\nthe things that we are. So if you think about you as\na 4 billion year old object, the things that are a part of you, like your capacity use\nlanguage or think abstractly or have mathematics,\nare just very, you know, like deep, temporal structures. That's why they look like\nthey're informational and abstract, is because they're like... They're existing in this\ntemporal part of you, but not necessarily spatial part. - Just because I have a 4\nbillion year old history, why does that mean I can't\nhang out with aliens? - There's a couple ideas\nthat are embedded here. So one of them comes, again, from Paul, he wrote this book years\nago about, you know, like the eerie silence\nand why we're alone. And he concluded the book with\nthis idea of quintelligence or something, but like\nthis idea that like, really advanced intelligence would basically just build\nitself into a quantum computer and it would wanna operate\nin the vacuum of space, 'cause that's the best place\nto do quantum computation, and it would just like run out all of its computations indefinitely, but it would look completely dark to the rest of the universe. And I don't think.... As typical, like, I don't\nthink that's actually like the right physics, but I think something about that idea, as I do with all ideas,\nis partially correct. And Freeman Dyson also\nhad this amazing paper about how long life could persist in a universe that was\nexponentially expanding. And his conception was like, if you imagine analog life form, it could run slower and\nslower and slower and slower and slower as a function of time. And so it would be able\nto run indefinitely, even against an exponentially\nexpanding universe, because it would just\nrun exponentially slower. And so I guess part of\nwhat I'm doing in my brain is putting those two things together along with this idea\nthat we are building... You know, like if you\nimagine, with our technology, we're now building\nvirtual realities, right? Like things we actually\ncall virtual reality, which required, you know,\nfour billions years of history and a whole bunch of data to basically embed them in\na computer architecture. So now you can put like, you\nknow, an Oculus headset on and think that you're\nin this world, right? And what you really are embedded in is in a very deep temporal structure. And so it's huge in time,\nbut it's very small in space, and you can go lots of places\nin the virtual space, right? But you're still stuck in\nlike your physical body and like sitting in the chair. And so, you know, part of it is, it might be the case that\nsufficiently evolved biospheres kind of virtualize themselves, and they internalize their universe and their sort of\ntemporal causal structure, and they close themselves off\nfrom the rest of the universe. - I just don't know if a\ndeep temporal structure necessarily means that you're closed off. - No, I don't either. So that's kind of my fear. So I'm not sure I'm\nagreeing with what I say. I'm just saying like, this\nis one sort of conclusion and you know, like in\nmy most sort of like... It's interesting, 'cause I\ndon't do psychedelic drugs, but when people describe to me, like your thing with the faces and stuff, and like I have... You know, I've had a lot of\ndeep conversations with friends that have done psychedelic\ndrugs for intellectual reasons and otherwise, but I'm always like, \"Oh, it sounds like you're\njust doing theoretical physics. Like that's what brains do on\ntheoretical physics.\" (laughs) So I live in these like\nreally abstract spaces most of the time, but there's also this\nissue of extinction, right? Like extinction events\nare basically pinching off an entire, like, causal structure. One of these like... I'm gonna call them time crystals, I don't like know what... But there's like these\nvery large objects in time, pinching off that whole\nstructure from the rest of it. And so it's like, if you\nimagine that sort of same thing in the universe, you know, I once thought that sufficiently\nadvanced technologies would look like black holes. - That would be just\ncompletely imperceptible to us. - Yeah. So there might be lots\nof aliens out there. Maybe that's the explanation\nfor all the singularities, they're all pinched off causal structures that virtualized their reality and kind of broke off from us. - Black holes in every way,\nso like untouchable to us or unlikely to be detectable by us- - Right.\n- With whatever sensory mechanisms we have. - Yeah, but the other\nway I think about it is, there is probably,\nhopefully life out there. So like I do work on\nlife detection efforts in the solar system, and I'm trying to help with the\nHabitable Worlds Observatory mission planning right now, and working with like the\nbio signatures team for that. Like to think about\nexoplanet bio signatures. So like I have some optimism\nthat we might find things, but there are the challenges that we don't know the\nlikelihood for life, like, which is what you were talking about. So if I get to a more grounded discussion, what I'm really interested in doing is trying to solve the origin of life so we can understand how\nlikely life is out there. So I don't think that the... I think that the problem\nof discovering alien life and solving the origin of\nlife are deeply coupled, and in fact are one and the same problem. And that the first contact with alien life will actually be in an\norigin of life experiment, but that part I'm super interested in. And then there's this other feature that I think about a lot, which is, our own technological phase of\ndevelopment as sort of like, what is this phase in the\nevolution of life on a planet. If you think about a\nbiosphere emerging on a planet and evolving over billions of years and evolving into a technosphere, when a technosphere can move off planet and basically reproduce\nitself on another planet, now you have biospheres\nreproducing themselves, basically. They have to go through\ntechnology to do that. And so there are ways of thinking about sort of the nature of intelligent life and how it spreads in that capacity, that I'm also really excited\nabout and thinking about. And all of those things\nfor me are connected. Like we have to solve the origin of life in order for us to get off planet, because we basically have to\nstart life on another planet, and we also have to\nsolve the origin of life in order to recognize\nother alien intelligence. Like all of these things are like literally the same problem. - Right, understanding the\norigin of life here on Earth is a way to understand ourselves and to... Understanding ourselves is a prerequisite for being able to detect other\nintelligent civilizations. I, for one, take it for what\nit's worth, on ayahuasca, one of the things I did is\nzoom out, like aggressively, at like a spaceship. And it would always go\nquickly through the galaxy, and from the galaxy to this\nrepresentation of the universe. And at least for me,\nfrom that perspective, it seemed like it was full of alien life. Not just alien life, but intelligent life- - I like that.\n- And conscious life. So like, I don't know how\nto convert it into words. It's more like a feeling,\nlike you were saying. - Yeah.\n- A feeling, convert it to a visual,\nto convert it to words. So I had a visual with it, but really it was a feeling, that it was just full\nof this vibrant energy, that I was feeling when I'm looking at the people in my life- - Yeah.\n- And full of gratitude, but that same exact thing is\neverywhere in the universe. - Right.\n- So- - I totally agree with this, like that visual, I really love. And I think we live in a universe that like generates life and purpose, and like it's part of the\nstructure of just the world. And so maybe like this sort\nof lonely view I have is, I never thought about it this way until you were describing that. I was like, \"I wanna\nlive in that universe.\" And I'm like a very optimistic person and I love building visions of reality that are positive, but I think for me right now,\nin the intellectual process, I have to tunnel through this\nparticular way of thinking about the loneliness\nof being like separated in time from everything else, which I think like we also all are, because time is what\ndefines us as individuals. - So part of you is drawn to the trauma of being alone deep-\n- Yeah. - In a physics sense.\n- Yeah, but also part of what I mean is, like you have to go through ideas you don't necessarily agree with to work out what you're\ntrying to understand. And I'm trying to be inside this structure so I can really understand it. And I don't think I've\nbeen able to like... Like I'm so deeply embedded in what we are intellectually, right now, that I don't have an ability\nto see these other ones that you're describing, if they're there."

      "section": "Great Perceptual Filter",
      "text": "- Well, one of the things\nyou kind of described that you already spoke to, you call it the great perceptual filter. - Yeah.\n- So there's the famous great filter, which is basically the idea that there's some really powerful moment in every intelligent civilization where they destroy themselves. - Yeah.\n- That explains why we have not seen aliens. And you're saying that\nthere's something like that in the temporal history of the\ncreation of complex objects, that at a certain point\nthey become an island, an island too far to reach\nbased on the perceptions. - I hope not, but yeah,\nI worry about it, yeah. - But that's basically meaning, there's something fundamental\nabout the universe, where the more complex you become, the harder it will be to\nperceive other complex- - Yeah, I mean just think about us with microbial life, right? Like we used to once be cells, and for most of human history, we didn't even recognize\ncellular life was there until we built a new\ntechnology, microscopes, that allowed us to see them, right? So it's kind of weird, right? Like things that we-\n- And they're close to us. - They're close, they're everywhere. - But also in the history\nof the development of complex objects, they're pretty close. - Yes, super close. Super close. Like yeah, I mean everything on this planet is like. (laughs) It's like pretty much the same thing. Like the space of\npossibilities is so huge, it's like we're virtually identical. - So how many flavors or kinds of life do\nyou think are possible? - I'm like trying to imagine all the little flickering\nlights in the universe. Like in the way that you were describing, that was kind of cool. - I mean, it was awesome to me. It was exactly that. It was like lights.\n- Yeah. - The way you maybe see a city, but yeah, a city from like up above, you see a city with the flickering lights, but there's a coldness to the city. - Yeah.\n- There's some... You know that, you know, humans\nare capable of good and evil and you could see like there's a complex feeling to the city. I had no such complex feeling\nabout seeing the lights of all the galaxies, whatever,\nthe billions of galaxies. - Yeah, this is kind of cool. I'll answer the question in a second, but I just maybe like... This idea of flickering lights and intelligence is\ninteresting to me, because I... You know, like we have\nsuch a human-centric view of alien intelligences, that a lot of the work that\nI've been doing with my lab is just trying to take inspiration from non-human life on Earth. And so I have this really\ntalented undergrad student that's basically building a model of alien communication based on fireflies. So one of my colleagues, Orit Peleg, she's totally brilliant, but she goes out with like GoPro cameras and like, you know,\nfilms in high resolution, all these firefly flickering. And she has like this theory about how their signaling evolved to like maximally differentiate\nthe flickering pattern. So like she has a theory\nbasically that predicts, you know, like this species should flash like this. If this one's flashing like this, this other one's gonna\ndo it at a slower rate, so that they... You know, like they can\ndistinguish each other living in the same environment. And so this undergrad's\nbuilding this model where you have like a pulsar background of all these like giant\nflashing sources in the universe and an alien intelligence, you know, wants to signal it's there, so it's flashing like a firefly. (laughs) And I just like the idea of thinking about non-human\naliens, so that was really fun. - The mechanism of the\nflashing, unfortunately is... Like the diversity of that is very high and we might not be able\nto see it, that's what- - Yeah, well I think there's some ways we might be able to\ndifferentiate that signal. I'm still thinking about this part of it. So one is, like if you have pulsars and they all have a certain spectrum to their pulsing patterns, and you have this one\nsignal that's in there, that's basically tried to\nmaximally differentiate itself from all the other\nsources in the universe. It might stick out in the distribution. Like there might be ways of actually being able to tell if it's an anomalous pulsar, basically. But I don't know if that\nwould really work or not. So, still thinking about it."

Can we explore the space\nof human aesthetics? - Yeah, I don't know. I've been kind of obsessed with the... I never know how to pronounce it. Is it Schiaparelli? Like, you know, like they\nhave ears and things. Like it's such like a\nweird, grotesque aesthetic, but like it's totally bizarre. But what I meant... Like I have a visceral experience when I walk into my closet. I have like a lot of- (laughs) - [Lex] How big is your closet? - It's pretty big. It's like, I do assembly\ntheory every morning when I walk in my closet, because I really like a very large, combinatorial, diverse palette, but I never know what I'm\ngonna build in the morning. - Do you get rid of stuff?\n- Sometimes. - Or do you have trouble\ngetting rid of stuff? Like- - I have trouble getting\nrid of some stuff. It depends on what it is. If it's vintage, it's hard to get rid of, 'cause it's kind of hard to replace. It depends on the piece, yeah. - So you have... Your closet is one of those\ntemporal time crystals that- - Yeah, it's like-\n- You get to visualize the entire history of the-\n- It's a physical manifestation of my personality. - Right. So why is that a good visualization of the combinatorial and\ncomposition and complex. - I think it's an interesting\nfeature of our species that we get to express ourself through what we wear, right? Like if you think about all those animals in the jungle you saw, like they're born the way they look, and then they're stuck with it for life. - That's true, I mean, it is one of the loudest, clearest, most consistent ways we\nsignal to each other- - Yeah.\n- It's the clothing we wear. - Yeah, and it's highly dynamic. I mean you can be dynamic if you want to. Very few people are... There's a certain bravery, but it's actually more about confidence, willing to play with style and like... And play with aesthetics. And I think it's interesting when you start experimenting with it, how it changes the fluidity\nof the social spaces and the way that you interact with them. - But there's also commitment. Like you have to wear\nthat outfit all today. - I know, I know. A big commitment. Do you feel like that\nevery morning? (laughs) - No. That's why-\n- I feel like, this is a life commitment. (laughs) - So all I have is suits and\nthe black shirt and jeans. Those are the two outfits. - Yeah. Well see this is the thing though, right? It's simplifies your thought\nprocess in the morning. So like I have other ways I do that. I park in the same exact parking spot when I go to work on the fourth\nfloor of a parking garage, because no one ever parks\non the fourth floor. So I don't have to remember\nwhere I park my car. But I really like aesthetics\nand playing with them. So I'm willing to spend part of my cognitive energy every morning trying to figure out\nwhat I wanna be that day. - Did you deliberately think about the outfit you're wearing today? - Yep.\n- Was there backup options? Or were you going back\nand forth between some- - Three or four, but I really like- - Were they drastically different? - Yes.\n- Okay.(laughs) Okay.\n- And then even this one could have been really different, because like, you know, it's not just the sort of\njacket and the shoes and like, and the hairstyle. It's like the jewelry and the accessories. So like any outfit is a\nlot of small decisions. - Well I think your current outfit is like a lot of shades of yellow. There's like a theme.\n- Yes. Yeah.\n- It's nice. I'm grateful that you did that. - Thanks.\n- It's like it's own art form. - Yeah, yellow's my\ndaughter's favorite color, and I never really\nthought about yellow much, but she's been obsessed with yellow. She's seven now and I don't\nknow, I just really love it. - I guess you can pick a color and just make that the constraint, and just go with it and understand the beauty-\n- I'm playing with yellow a lot lately. Like this is not even the most yellow, 'cause I have black pants on, but I have... I've worn outfits that have probably five\nshades of yellow in them. - Wow.\n(Sara laughs)"

      "text": "What do you think beauty is? We seem to... So underlying this idea of\nplaying with aesthetics is, we find certain things beautiful. - Yeah.\n- What is it that humans find beautiful? And why do we need to\nfind things beautiful? - Yeah. You know, it's interesting. I mean I am attracted\nto style and aesthetics, because I think they're beautiful, but it's much more because I\nthink it's fun to play with. And so I will get to the beauty thing, but I guess I wanna just\nexplain a little bit about my motivation this space, 'cause it's really an\nintellectual thing for me. And you know, Stewart Brand\nhas this great infographic about the layers of like human society. And I think it starts with\nlike the natural sciences and like physics at the bottom, and it goes through all these layers, and it's like economics and\nthen like fashion is at the top, it's like the fastest moving\npart of human culture. And I think I really like that, because it's so dynamic and so short in it's temporal longevity, contrasted with like\nstudying the laws of physics, which are like, you know, like\nthe deep structure reality, that I feel like bridging those scales tells me much more about\nthe structure of the world that I live in. - That said, there's\ncertain kinds of fashions, like a dude in a black\nsuit with a black tie seems to be less dynamic. - Yeah.\n- It seems to persist through time. - Are you embodying this?\n- Yeah, I think so. (both laugh) I think it just-\n- I'd like to see you wear yellow, Lex. (laughs) - I wouldn't even know\nwhat to do with myself. I would freak out. I wouldn't know how to- - You wouldn't know how\nto be you, yeah, I know. This is amazing though, isn't it? Amazing, like you have\nthe choice to do it. But one of my favorite... Just on the question of beauty, one of my favorite fashion designers of all time is Alexander McQueen. And he was really phenomenal, but like his early... And actually, I kind of used\nlike what happened to him in the fashion industry\nas a coping mechanism with our paper when... Like the nature paper in the fall when everyone was saying\nit was controversial and how terrible that\nlike, you know like... But controversial is good, right? But like when Alexander McQueen,\nyou know, first came out with his fashion lines, he\nwas mixing horror and beauty, and people were horrified. It was so controversial. Like it was macabre. He had like... You know, like it looked like\nthere were blood on the models and like- - [Lex] That is beautiful. We're just looking at some pictures here. - Yeah, no, I mean his stuff is amazing. His first like runway line,\nI think, was called Nihilism. I don't know if you could find it. You know, I mean he was really dramatic. He carried a lot of trauma with him. There you go, that's... Yeah. Yeah.\n- Wow. - But he changed the fashion industry. His stuff became very popular. - That's a good outfit to\nshow up to a party. (laughs) - Right, right. But this gets at the question like, is that horrific or is it beautiful? And I think, you know,\nhe had a traumatic... He ended up committing suicide, and actually he left his death note on the descent of man. So he was a really deep person. - So I mean great fashion certainly has that kind of depth to it. - Yeah, it sure does. So I think it's the\nintellectual pursuit, right? Like it's not... So this is like very highly intellectual, and I think it's a lot like\nhow I play with language, is the same way that I play with fashion, or the same way that I play with ideas in theoretical physics. Like there's always this space that you can just push things just enough. So they look like something\nsomeone thinks is familiar but they're not familiar, and yeah, and I think that's really cool. - It seems like beauty doesn't\nhave much function, right? But it seems to also\nhave a lot of influence on the way we-\n- It has tons of function. What do you mean it doesn't have function? - I guess sexual selection\nincorporates beauty somehow. But why? Because beauty is a sign\nof health or something? I don't even- - Oh, evolutionarily? Maybe. But then beauty becomes a\nsignal of other things, right? So it's really not like... And then beauty becomes an adaptive trait, so it can change with different... Like, you know, maybe\nsome species would think, well you thought the frog having babies come out\nof its back was beautiful and I thought it was grotesque. Like there's not a universal\ndefinition of what's beautiful. It is something that is\ndependent on your history and how you interact with the world. And I guess what I like about beauty, like any other concept, is\nwhen you turn it on its head. So, you know, maybe the traditional\nconception of, you know, why women wear makeup and\nthey dress certain ways is because they wanna look beautiful and, you know, pleasing to people. And I just like to do it\n'cause it's a confidence thing. It's about embodying the\nperson that I want to be and about owning that person, and then the way that people\ninteract with that person is very different than\nif I didn't have the... Like, if I wasn't using\nthat attribute as part of... And obviously, that's influenced\nby the society I live, and like what's aesthetically\npleasing things. But it's interesting to be\nable to turn that around and not have it necessarily\nbe about the aesthetics, but about the power dynamics\nthat the aesthetics create. - But you're saying there's\nsome function to beauty, in that way. In the way you're describing, and the dynamic it creates\nin the social interaction. - Well the point is, you're saying it's an adaptive trait for like sexual selection or something. And I'm saying that the adaptation that beauty confers is\nfar richer than that. And some of the adaptation\nis about social hierarchy and social mobility and\njust plain social dynamics. Like why do some people dress goth? It's 'cause they identify with a community and a culture associated with that, and they get, you know... And that's a beautiful aesthetic. It's a different aesthetic,\nsome people don't like it. - So it has the same\nrichness as does language. - Yes.\n- It's the same kind of- - Yes, and I think too\nfew people think about the way that they... The aesthetics they build\nfor themselves in the morning and how they carry it in the world, and the way that other\npeople interact with that, because they put clothes on, and they don't think about\nclothes as carrying function."

      "section": "Language",
      "text": "- Let's jump from beauty to language. There's so many ways to\nexplore the topic of language. You called it... You said that language is parts of language or language in itself, and the mechanism of language\nis a kind of living life form. You've tweeted a lot about this\nin all kinds of poetic ways. Let's talk about the\ncomputation aspect of it. You tweeted, \"The world\nis not a computation, but computation is our\nbest current language for understanding the world. It is important we recognize this so we can start to see the\nstructure of our future languages that will allow us to see deeper than computation allows us.\" So what's the use of language in helping us understand\nand make sense of the world? - I think one thing that I feel like I notice much more viscerally than I feel like I hear\nother people describe is that the representations in our mind and the way that we use language are not the things like... Actually, I mean, this\nis an important point, going back to what Godel did, but also this idea of signs and symbols and all kinds of ways of separating them. There's like the word, right? And then there's like what the\nword means about the world. And we often confuse those things. And what I feel very viscerally, I almost sometimes think I have some kind of like\nsynesthesia for language or something, and I just\nlike don't interact with it like the way that other people do. But for me, words are objects, and the objects are not the\nthings that they describe, they have like a different\nontology to them. Like they're physical things, and they carry causation\nand they can create meaning, but they're not what we think they are. And also like the internal\nrepresentations in our mind, like the things I'm seeing about this room are probably, you know, like\nthey're small projection of the things that are\nactually in this room. And I think we have such a difficult time moving past the way that\nwe build representations in the mind, and the way that we\nstructure our language, to realize that those are approximations to what's out there, and they're fluid, and we\ncan play around with them, and we can see deeper\nstructure underneath them, that I think, like, we're missing a lot. - Yeah, but also the life\nof the mind is in some ways richer than the physical reality. - Sure.\n- What's going on in your mind, it might be a projection- - Right.\n- Actually here, but there's also all kinds of\nother stuff going on there. - Yeah, for sure. I love this essay by Poincare about like mathematical creativity, where he talks about this\nsort of like frothing of all these things, and then like somehow you\nbuild theorems on top of it, and they become kind of concrete. But like, and I also think\nabout this with language, it's like there's a lot of\nstuff happening in your mind, but you have to compress it\nin this few sets of words to try to convey it to someone. So it's a compactification of the space, and it's not a very efficient one. And I think just recognizing that there's a lot that's\nhappening behind language is really important. I think this is one of the great things about the existential trauma\nof large language models, I think is the recognition that language is not\nthe only thing required. Like there's something underneath it. Not by everybody. - Can you just speak to the feeling you have when\nyou think about words? So is there... Like what's the magic of words to you? Is it like... It almost sometimes feels like\nyou're playing with it? Like- - [Sara] Yeah, I was just gonna\nsay it's like a playground. - But you're almost like... I think one of the things you enjoy, maybe I'm projecting, is deviating, like using words in ways\nthat not everyone uses them. Like slightly sort of deviating\nfrom the norm a little bit. - I love doing that in everything I do, but especially with language. - But not so far that\nit doesn't make sense. - Exactly.\n- So you're always like tethered to reality, to the norm, but like are playing with it, like basically fucking with\npeople's minds a little bit. I mean like, you know, and in so doing, creating a different perspective on another thing that's\nbeen previous explored in a different way. - Yeah, it's literally\nmy favorite thing to do. - Yeah. Use words as one way to make people think. - Yeah, so I, you know... A lot of my sort of like, what happens in my mind when\nI'm thinking about ideas is I've been presented\nwith this information about how people think about things, and I try to go around\nto different communities and hear the ways that different... Whether it's like, you know, hanging out with a bunch of artists or philosophers or scientists, thinking about things, like they all think\nabout it different ways, and then I just try to figure out like, how do you take the structure of the way that we're talking about it and turn it slightly, so you have all the same pieces that everybody sees are there, but the description\nthat you've come up with seems totally different. So they can understand that there's... Like they understand the\npattern you're describing, but they never heard the\nstructure underlying it described the way that you describe it. - Is there words or terms you remember that disturbed people the most? Maybe the positive sense of disturbed. Assembly theory, I suppose, is one. - Yeah, I mean the first couple sentences of that paper disturbed people a lot, and I think they were\nreally carefully constructed in exactly this kind of way. - What was that? Let me look it up. - Oh, it was really fun. But I think it's\ninteresting, 'cause I do... You know, sometimes I'm\nvery upfront about it. I say I'm gonna use the same word in probably six different\nways in a lecture, and I will. - You write, \"Scientists have grappled with reconciling biological evolution with immutable laws of the\nuniverse defined by physics. These laws underpin life's origin, evolution and the-\" (Sara faintly speaking) - [Sara] When he was here too. (laughs) - \"The development of human culture.\" Well he was... I think your for words\nruns deeper than Lee's. - Yeah, for sure. I mean this is part of the sort of brilliant thing about\nour collaboration is, you know, complimentary skillsets. So I love playing with the\nabstract space of language, and it's a really interesting playground when I'm working with Lee, because he thinks at a much deeper level of abstraction than can\nbe expressed by language. And the ideas we work on are hard to talk about for that reason."

      "section": "Computation",
      "text": "- What do you think about\ncomputation as a language? - I think it's a very poor language. A lot of people think\nis a really great one, but I think it has some nice properties, but I think the feature of it\nthat you know is compelling is this kind of idea of universality, that like you can... If you have a language, you can describe things\nin any other language. - Well, for me, one of the people who kind of revealed the\nexpressive power of computation, aside from Alan Turing, is Stephen Wolfram, through\nall the explorations of like cellular automata type of objects that he did in a new kind\nof science and afterwards. So what did he get from that? Like the kind of computational worlds that are revealed through even something as simple\nas cellular automata. Like, it seems like\nthat's a really nice way to explore languages that are far outside our human languages, and do so rigorously, and understand how those\nkinds of complex systems can interact with each other, can emerge, all that kind of stuff. - I don't think that they're\noutside our human languages. I think they define the boundary of the space of human languages. They allow us to explore\nthings within that space, which is also fantastic. But I think there is a\nset of ideas that takes... And Stephen Wolfram has\nworked on this quite a lot and contributed very significantly to it. And you know, I really\nlike some of the stuff that Stephen's doing with\nlike his physics project, but don't agree with a lot\nof the foundations of it. But I think the space is\nreally fun that he's exploring. You know, there's this assumption that computation is at\nthe base of reality, and I kind of see it at the top\nof reality, not at the base, because I think computation\nwas built by our biosphere. It's something that happened after many billion years of evolution, and it doesn't happen in\nevery physical object. It only happens in some of them. And I think one of the reasons that we feel like the\nuniverse is computational is because it's so easy for us as things that have the theory\nof computation in our minds, and actually in some sense, it might be related to the\nfunctioning of our minds and how we build languages\nto describe the world and sets of relations\nto describe the world. But it's easy for us to\ngo out into the world and build computers, and then we mistake\nour ability to do that, with assuming that the\nworld is computational. And I'll give you a really simple example. This one came from John Conway. I, one time had a conversation with him, which was really delightful. He was really fun. But he was pointing out that if you, you know, string lights\nin a barn, you know, you can program them to have your favorite one dimensional CA, and you might even be able\nto make them, you know, do a like... Be capable of universal computation. Is universal computation a\nfeature of the string lights? - Well, no.\n- No, it's probably not. It's a feature of the fact\nthat you as a programmer had a theory that you could embed in the physical architecture\nof the string lights. Now what happens though is we get confused by\nthis kind of distinction between us as agents in the world that actually can transfer things that life does onto other\nphysical substrates, with what the world is. And so for example, you'll\nsee people, you know, studying the mathematics of\nchemical reaction networks and saying, \"Well, chemistry\nis turning universal,\" or studying the laws of physics and saying, \"The laws of\nphysics are turning universal.\" But anytime that you wanna do that, you always have to\nprepare an initial state. You have to, you know... You have to constrain the rule space, and then you have to actually be able to demonstrate the\nproperties of computation. And all of that requires an agent or a designer to be able to do that. - But it gives you an\nintuition if you look at a 1D or 2D cellular automata, it allows you to build an intuition of how you can have complexity emerge from very simple beginnings, very simple initial conditions. - I think that's the intuition that people have derived from it. The intuition I get from cellular automata is that the flat space\nof an initial condition in a fixed dynamical law is not rich enough to describe an open-ended generation process. And so the way I see cellular automata, is they're embedded slices in a much larger causal structure. And if you wanna look\nat a deterministic slice of that causal structure,\nyou might be able to extract a set of consistent rules that you might call a cellular automata, but you could embed them\nas much larger space, that's not dynamical and is\nabout the causal structure and relations between all\nof those computations, and that would be the space\ncellular automata live in. And I think that's the space\nthat Stephen is talking about, when he talks about his Ruliad and these hypergraphs of all\nthese possible computations. But I wouldn't take\nthat as my base reality, because I think again, computation itself, this abstract property, computation, is not at the base of reality. - Look, can we just linger\non that Ruliad, this- - [Sara] Yeah, one Ruliad\nadd to rule them all. - Yeah, so what... This is part of Wolfram- - Yeah.\n- Physics project. It's what he calls the\nentangled limit of everything that is computationally possible. - Yeah.\n- So what's your problem with the Ruliad? - Well, it's interesting. So Stephen came to a workshop\nwe had in the Beyond Center in the fall, and the workshop theme was, \"Mathematics: Is It Evolved or Eternal.\" And he gave a talk about the Ruliad, and he was talking about how,\nyou know, a lot of the things that we talk about in the Beyond Center, like does reality have a bottom? You know, if it has a bottom, what is it? You know, like what's the- - I need to go to-\n- We'll have you to one sometime. - This is great. Does reality have a bottom? - Yeah, so we had one that was... It was called infinite\nturtles are ground truth. And it was really just about this issue. But the thing that was interesting, I think Stephen was trying\nto make the argument that, you know, fundamental\nparticles aren't fundamental, gravitation is not fundamental. You know, these are just turtles, and computation is fundamental. And I just, I remember\npointing out to him, I was like, \"Well,\ncomputation is your turtle.\" And I think it's a weird turtle to have. - First of all, isn't it\nokay to have a turtle? - It's totally fine to have a turtle. Everyone has a turtle. You can't build a theory without a turtle. - Yep.\n- It's just... So it depends on the\nproblem you wanna describe. And actually, the reason\nI can't get behind Stephen's ontology is I don't know what question\nhe's trying to answer. And without a question to answer, I don't understand why you're\nbuilding a theory of reality. - And the question you're\ntrying to answer is- - What life is.\n- What life is, which another simpler way of phrasing that is how did life originate? - Well, I started working\non the origin of life, and I think what my challenge was there, was no one knew what life was. And so you can't really\ntalk about the origination of something if you don't know what it is. And so the way I would approach it is, if you wanna understand what life is, then proving that physics is\nsolving the origin of life. So there's the theory of what life is, but there's the actual demonstration that that theory is an\naccurate description of the phenomena you aim to describe. So again, they're the same problem. It's not like I can\ndecouple origin of life from what life is. It's like that is the problem. And the point I guess I'm making about having a question is, no matter what slice of reality you take, what regularity of nature\nyou're gonna try to describe, there will be an abstraction that unifies that structure of reality, hopefully. And that will have a\nfundamental layer to it, right? 'Cause you have to explain something in terms of something else. So if I wanna explain life for example, then my fundamental description of nature has to be something I think that has to do with time being fundamental. But if I wanted to describe, I don't know, the sort of interactions of\nmatter and light, you know, I have elementary\nparticles be fundamental. If I wanna describe electricity and magnetism in the 1800s, I have to have waves\nbe fundamental, right? So like you... Or in quantum mechanics, like it's a wave function\nthat's fundamental, 'cause that's the sort\nof explanatory paradigm of your theory. So I guess I don't know\nwhat problem saying, \"Computation is fundamental\" solves. - Doesn't he want to understand how does the basic quantum mechanics and general relativity emerge? - Yeah, but that-\n- And cause time- - Right, so I think-\n- Then that doesn't really answer an important question for us? - Well, I think that the issue is, general relativity and quantum\nmechanics are expressed in mathematical languages, and then computation is\na mathematical language. So you're basically saying that maybe there's a more\nuniversal mathematical language for describing theories of\nphysics that we already know. That's an important question, and I do think that's\nwhat Steven's trying to do and do well. But then the question becomes, does that formulation of\na more universal language for describing the laws of\nphysics that we know now tell us anything new about\nthe nature of reality? Or is it a language? - And to you, languages are fundamental... It can't be fundamental. - The language itself is\nnever the fundamental thing. It's whatever it's describing."

      "text": "- So one of the possible\ntitles you were thinking about originally for the book is\n\"The Hard Problem of Life,\" sort of reminiscent of the\nhard problem of consciousness. So you are saying that assembly theory is supposed to be answering the\nquestion about what is life. So let's go to the other hard problems. You also say that's the\neasiest of the hard problems, is the hard problem of life. So what do you think is\nthe nature of intelligence and consciousness? You think something like assembly theory can help us understand that? - I think if assembly theory is an accurate depiction\nof the physics of life, it should shed a lot of\nlight on those problems. And in fact, I sometimes wonder if the problems of consciousness and intelligence are at all different than the problem of life generally. And I'm of two minds of it, but I in general try to... You know, like the process of my thinking is trying to regularize\neverything into one theory. So pretty much every\ninteraction I have is like, \"Oh, how do I fold that into...\" And like, so I'm just building\nthis giant abstraction, that's basically trying to\ntake every piece of data I've ever gotten in my brain into a theory of what life is. And consciousness and intelligence are obviously some of the\nmost interesting things that life has manifest. And so I think they're very telling about some of the deeper features\nabout the nature of life. - It does seem like they're\nall flavors of the same thing. But it's interesting to\nwonder like at which stage does something that we\nwould recognize as life, in a sort of canonical, silly human way, and something that we would\nrecognize as intelligence. At which stage does that emerge? Like at which assembly\nindex does that emerge? And at which assembly\nindex is a consciousness something that we would\ncanonically recognize as consciousness? - Is this the use... Like this use of flavors, the same as you meant when you were talking\nabout flavors of alien... Like alien life. - Yeah, sure. Yeah. I mean it's same as the\nflavors of ice cream and the flavors of fashion. - Yeah, like, but we were\ntalking about in terms of colors and like very nondescript. But the way that you just\ntalked about flavors now is more in like the space of\nconsciousness and intelligence. It was kind of like much more specific. - It'd be nice if there's\na formal way of expressing- - Quantifying flavors?\n- Quantifying flavors. - Yeah.\n- It seems like, I would order it life,\nconsciousness, intelligence probably. As like the order in which things emerge, and they're all just the same- - They're the same thing.\n- We're using the word life differently here. I mean life sort of, when I'm talking about, what is a living versus a non-living thing at a bar with a person, I'm already like four or five\ndrinks in, that kind of thing. - Just that. (laughs)\n- Like we're not being too philosophical. Like here's the thing that moves, and here's the thing that doesn't move. But maybe consciousness precedes that. It's a weird dance there with like... Is life proceed consciousness or consciousness proceed life. And I think that\nunderstanding of what life is in the way you're doing, will help us disentangle that - Depending on what you wanna explain. As I was saying before, you have to assume\nsomething's fundamental. And so because people can't\nexplain consciousness, there's a temptation for some people to wanna take consciousness\nas fundamental, and assume everything else\nis derived out of that. And then you get some people that wanna assume\nconsciousness preceded life. And I don't find either of those views particularly illuminating, I think... 'Cause I don't wanna assume a feminology before I explain a thing. And so what I've tried really hard to do is not assume, that I\nthink life is anything, except hold on to sort of the patterns and structures that seem to\nbe the sort of consistent ways that we talk about this thing, and then try to build a\nphysics that describes that. And I think that's a really\ndifferent approach than saying, you know, \"Consciousness is this thing, you know, we all feel and\nexperience about things.\" I would wanna understand the regularities associated with that, and build a deeper\nstructure underneath that, and build into it. I wouldn't wanna assume that thing and that I understand that thing, which is usually how I\nsee people talk about it. - The difference between\nlife and consciousness. - Yeah.\n- Which comes first. - Yeah, so I think if\nyou're thinking about this sort of thinking about living things as these giant causal structures, or these objects that are deep in time, or whatever language we end\nup using to describe it, it seems to me that\nconsciousness is about... The fact that we have\na conscious experience is because we are these\ntemporally extended objects. So consciousness and the abstraction that we have in our minds is actually a manifestation\nof all the time that's rolled up in us, and it's just because we're so huge, that we have this very large inner space that we're experiencing, that's not... And it's also separated off\nfrom the rest of the world because we're the separate thread in time. And so our consciousness\nis not exactly shared with anything else, because nothing else occupies\nthe same part of time that we occupy. But I can understand something about you maybe being conscious because you and I didn't\nseparate that far in the past, in terms of our causal histories. So in some sense we can\neven share experiences with each other through language, because of that sort of\noverlap in our structure. - Well then if consciousness is merely temporal separateness, then that comes before life. - It's not merely temporal separateness, it's about the depth in that time. So it's-\n- Yes. - The reason that my conscious experience is not the same as yours is\nbecause we're separated in time. The fact that I have\na conscious experience is because I'm an object\nthat's super deep in time, so I'm huge in time, and that means that there's a lot there that I am basically in some\nsense, a universe onto myself, because my structure is so large relative to the amount\nof space that I occupy. - But it feels like that's possible to do before you get anything like bacteria. - I think there's a horizon, and I don't know how\nto articulate this yet, it's a little bit like the\nhorizon at the origin of life, where the space inside\na particular structure becomes so large that it has some access to a space that doesn't feel as physical. It's almost like this\nidea of counterfactuals. So I think like the past\nhistory of your horizon is just much larger\nthan can be encompassed in like a small configuration of matter. So you can like pull this\nstuff into existence. This property is maybe\na continuous property, but there's something really different about human level physical systems, and human level ability\nto understand reality. I really love David Deutsch's conception of universal explainers, and that's related to the\ntheory of universal computation. And I think there's some\ntransition that happens there. But maybe to describe\nthat a little bit better, what I can also say is like, what intelligence is in this framework? So you have these objects that are, you know, large in time. They were selected to exist by constraining the\npossible space of objects to this particular... Like all of the matter is funneled into this particular\nconfiguration of object over time, and so these objects\narise through selection, but the more selection that\nyou have embedded in you, the more possible selection\nyou have on your future. And so selection and evolution, we usually think about in the past sense, where selection happened in the past, but objects that are high\ndensity configurations of matter that have a lot of selection in them are also selecting agents in the universe. So they actually embody\nthe physics of selection, and they can select on possible futures. And I guess what I'm saying\nwith respect to consciousness and the experience we have, is that there's something\nvery deep about that structure and the nature of how we\nexist in that structure that has to do with how\nwe're navigating that space, and how we generate that space, and how we continue to\npersist in that space."

      "section": "Artificial life",
      "text": "- Is there shortcuts we can take to artificially engineering\nliving organisms? Artificial life, artificial consciousness, artificial intelligence. So maybe just looking pragmatically at the LLMs we have now, do you think those can\nexhibit qualities of life, qualities of consciousness, qualities of intelligence in the way we think of intelligence? - I mean I think they already do, but not in the way I\nhear popularly discussed. So they're obviously\nsignatures of intelligence and a part of a ecosystem\nof intelligence systems. But I don't know that\nindividually, you know, I would assign all the properties\nto them that people have. It's a little like, so, you know, we talked about the\nhistory of eyes before, and like how eyes scaled up\ninto technological forms, and language has also had a\nreally interesting history, and got much more interesting, I think, once we started writing it down, and then, you know, in\ninventing books and things. But like, you know, every\ntime that we started storing language in a new way, you know, where we're kind of\nexistentially traumatized by it. So like, you know, the idea of written\nlanguage was traumatic, because it seemed like the\ndead were speaking to us even though they were deceased, and books were traumatic because, you know, like suddenly\nthere were lots of copies of this information available to everyone and it was gonna somehow dilute it. And large language models\nare kind of interesting, because they don't feel as static. They're very dynamic. But if you think about language in the way I was describing it before as, language is this very\nlarge in time structure, and before it had been\nsomething that was distributed over human brains as a dynamic structure, and occasionally we\nstore components of that very large dynamic structure in books or in written language. Now we can actually store the dynamics of that structure in a physical artifact, which is a large language model. And so I think about it almost like the evolution\nof genomes in some sense, where, you know, there might've been like really primitive genes on\nthe first living things, and they didn't store\na lot of information, or they were like really messy. And then we, you know, like by the time you get\nto the eukaryotic cell, you have this really\ndynamic genetic architecture that's read writeable, right? And has all of these different properties. And I think large language models are kind of like the\ngenetic system for language in some sense, where it's allowing a sort of archiving that's highly dynamic. And I think it's very paradoxical to us, because obviously in human history, we haven't been used to\nconversing with anything that's not human. But now we can converse basically with a crystallization\nof human language in a computer, that's a\nhighly dynamic crystal, because it's a crystallization in time of this massive abstract structure that's evolved over human history, and is now put into a small device. - I think crystallization kind of implies a limit on its capabilities. - I think there's not a... I mean it very purposefully, because a particular\ninstantiation of a language model trained on a particular data set becomes a crystal of the\nlanguage at that time it was trained, but obviously we're\niterating with the technology and evolving it. - I guess the question is, when you crystallize it,\nwhen you compress it, when you archive it, you're archiving some slice of the collective intelligence\n- Yes. of the human species.\n- That's right. - And the question is,\nlike how powerful is that? - Right? It's a societal\nlevel technology, right? We've actually put collective\nintelligence in a box. - Yeah, I mean, how much smarter is the\ncollective intelligence of humans versus a single human? And that's the question of AGI versus human level intelligence. Super human level intelligence versus human level intelligence. Like how much smarter can this thing... When done well, when we solve a lot of the\ncomputation complexities, maybe there's some data complexities, and how to really archive this thing, crystallize this thing really well. - Yeah.\n- How powerful is this thing gonna be? Like what's your thought? - I actually... I don't like the sort of\nlanguage we use around that, and I think the language really matters. So I don't know how to talk about how much smarter one human\nis than another, right? Like usually we talk about abilities or particular talent someone has. And you know, going back to,\nyou know, David Deutsch's idea of universal explainers, it like... You know, adopting the\nview that, you know, we're the first, you know, kinds of structures\nour biosphere has built that can understand the rest of reality. We have this universal\ncomprehension capability. You know, he makes an argument that basically, we're the first things that actually are capable\nof understanding anything. It doesn't mean an individual\nunderstands everything, but like we have that capability. And so there's not a\ndifference between that and what people talk about with AGI. In some sense, AGI is\na universal explainer, but you know, like it\nmight be that a computer is much more efficient at doing, you know, I don't know, prime\nfactorization or something, than a human is, but it doesn't mean that\nit's necessarily smarter or has a broader reach\nof the kind of things that it can understand, than a human does. And so I think we really\nhave to think about, is it a level shift? Or is it, we're enhancing certain kinds\nof capabilities humans have in the same way that we enhanced eyesight by making telescopes and microscopes. Are we enhancing capabilities\nwe have into technologies, and the entire global ecosystem\nis getting more intelligent? Or is it really that we're building some super machine in a box that's gonna be smart and kill everybody? That sounds like a science... It's not even a science fiction narrative, it's a bad science fiction narrative. I just don't think it's actually accurate to any of the technologies we're building, or the way that we should\nbe describing them. It's not even how we should\nbe describing ourselves. - So the benevolence stories,\nthere's a benevolence system that's able to transform our economy, our way of life by just, you\nknow, 10X-ing the GDP of- - Well, these are human questions, right? I don't think they're\nnecessarily questions that we're gonna like outsource to an artificial intelligence. I think what is happening and will continue to happen, is there's a co-evolution between humans and technology that's happening. And we're coexisting in\nthis ecosystem right now, and we're maintaining\na lot of the balance, and for the balance to\nshift to the technology would require some very bad human actors, which is a real risk. Or some sort of... I don't know, some sort\nof dynamic that favors... Like I just don't know how that plays out without human agency actually trying to put\nit in that direction. - It could also be how rapid the rate- - The rapid rate is scary. So like, I think the\nthings that are, you know, terrifying are, you know,\nthe ideas of deep fakes or you know, like, you know, all the kinds of issues\nthat become legal issues about artificial\nintelligence technologies. And using them to control weapons or using them for, you know, like child pornography\nor you know, like the... Or like, you know, faking\nout that someone's, you know, loved one was kidnapped or\nkilled and it, you know... Like, there's all kinds of things that are super scary in this landscape. And all kinds of new\nlegislation needs to be built, and all kinds of guardrails\non the technology to make sure that people don't\nabuse it need to be built, and that needs to happen. And I think one function of sort of the artificial\nintelligence doomsday, sort of, part of our culture right now, is it's sort of our immune\nresponse to knowing that's coming and we're over scaring ourselves, so we try to act more\nquickly, which is good. But I just, you know, it's\nabout the words that we use versus the actual things\nhappening behind the words. I think one thing that's good is when people are talking\nabout things different ways, it makes us think about them. And also when things are\nexistentially threatening, we wanna pay attention to those. But the ways that they're\nexistentially threatening, and the ways that we're\nexperiencing existential trauma, I don't think that we're\nreally gonna understand for another century or two, if ever. And I certainly think they're not the way that we're describing them now. - Well, creating existential trauma is one of the things that\nmakes life fun, I guess. - Yeah, it's just what we\ndo to ourselves. (laughs) - It gives us really exciting,\nbig problems to solve. - Yeah, for sure.\n- Do you think we'll see these AI systems become conscious, or convince us that they're conscious, and then maybe we'll have\nrelationships with them? Romantic relationships? - Well, I think people are gonna have romantic relationships with them, and I also think that some people would be convinced already that they're conscious. But I think in order... You know, what does it\ntake to convince people that something is conscious? I think that we actually\nhave to have an idea of what we're talking about, that we have to have a theory that explains when things\nare conscious or not, that's testable, right? And we don't have one right now. So I think until we have that, it's always gonna be\nthis sort of gray area, where some people think it hasn't, and some people think it doesn't, because we don't actually know what we're talking about\nthat we think it has. - So do you think it's possible\nto get out of the gray area and really have a formal\ntest for consciousness? - For sure.\n- And for life, as you were- - For sure.\n- As we've been talking about for assembly theory? - [Sara] Yeah. - Consciousness is a tricky one. - It is a tricky one. I mean, that's why it's\ncalled the hard problem of consciousness, because it's hard. And you know, it might even be outside of the purview of science, which means that we can't understand it in a scientific way. There might be other ways\nof coming to understand it, but those may not be the ones that we necessarily want\nfor technological utility, or for developing laws with respect to, because the laws are, you know, the things that are gonna\ngovern the technology. - Well I think that's actually where the hard problem of consciousness, a different hard problem\nof consciousness is that, I fear that humans will resist. That's the last thing they will resist, is calling something else conscious. - Oh, that's interesting. I think it depends on the culture though, because I mean, some\ncultures already think like everything's imbued with,\nyou know, a life essence or a kind of conscious. - I don't think those\ncultures have nuclear weapons. - No, they don't, and they're probably not building the most advanced technologies. - The cultures that are primed for destroying the other, constructing a very\neffective propaganda machine of what the other is, the group to hate, are the cultures that I worry would- - Yeah, I know.\n- Would be very resistant to label something, and to sort of acknowledge\nthe consciousness laden in a thing that\nwas created by us humans. - And so what do you\nthink the risks are there? That the conscious things\nwill get angry with us and fight back? - No, that we would torture and kill conscious beings. - Oh yeah. I think we do that quite\na lot anyway, without... I mean it goes back to your... And I don't know how to feel about this, but you know, like we talked already about the predator prey thing that like, in some sense, you know, being alive requires eating\nother things that are alive. And even if you're a vegetarian or you know, like try to have like... Like you're still eating\nliving things, yeah. - So maybe part of the story of Earth will involve a predator\nprey dynamic between humans- - That struggle for existence.\n- And human creations. - Yeah.\n- And all of that is part of the technosphere.\n- But I don't like thinking about them as like, our technologies as a separate species. 'Cause this again goes\nback to this sort of levels of selection issue. And you know, if you think\nabout humans individually alive, you miss the fact that\nsocieties are also alive. And so I think about it\nmuch more in the sense of... An ecosystem's not the right word, but we don't have the right words for these things of like... And this is why I talk\nabout the technosphere, it's a system that is both\nhuman and technological. It's not human or technological. And so this is the part that\nI think we are really good for the like... And this is driving in part a lot of the sort of attitude of like, \"I'll kill you first\nwith my nuclear weapons.\" We're really good at\nidentifying things as other, we're not really good at\nunderstanding when we're the same, or when we're part of an integrated system that's actually functioning together in some kind of cohesive way. So even if you look at like, you know, the division in American politics\nor something, for example, it's important that there's multiple sides that are arguing with each other, because that's actually how\nyou resolve society's issues. It's not like a bad feature. I think like some of the\nsort of extreme positions and like the way people talk\nabout it are maybe not ideal, but that's how societies solve problems. What it looks like for an individual is really different than\nthe societal level outcomes. And the fact that like, there is... I don't wanna call it\ncognition or computation, I don't know what you call it, but like there is a process playing out in the dynamics of societies, that we are all individual actors in, and like, we're not part of that. You know, like it requires\nall of us acting individually, but like this higher level structure is playing out some things, and like things are getting solved for it to be able to maintain itself. And that's the level that\nour technologies live at. They don't live at our level, they live at the societal level, and they're deeply integrated\nwith the social organism, if you wanna call it that. And so I really get upset\nwhen people talk about the species of artificial intelligence. I'm like, \"You mean we\nlive in an ecosystem of all these kind of intelligent things and these animating technologies\nthat we're, you know, in some sense helping to come alive. We are generating them, but it's not like the biosphere eliminated all of its past history when it invented a new species.\" All of these things get scaffolded, and we're also augmenting ourselves at the same time that we're\nbuilding technologies. I don't think we can anticipate what that system's gonna look like. - So in some fundamental way, you always want to be\nthinking about the planet as one organism. - The planet is one living thing. - What happens when it\nbecomes multi-planetary? Is it still just the- - Still the same causal chain.\n- Same causal chain. - It's like when the\nfirst cell split into two. That's what I was talking about. When a planet reproduces itself, the technosphere emerges\nenough understanding. It's like this recursive... Like the entire history of\nlife is just recursion, right? So you have an original life event. It evolves for 4 billion\nyears, at least on our planet. It evolves the technosphere, the technologies themselves\nstart to become... Having this property we call life, which is the phase we're undergoing now. It solves the origin of itself, and then it figures out\nhow that process all works, understands how to make more life, and then can copy itself\nonto another planet. So the whole structure\ncan reproduce itself. And so the origin of life\nis happening again right now on this planet in the technosphere, with the way that our planet is undergoing another transition. Just like at the origin of life when geochemistry can\ntransition to biology, which is the global... For me, it was a planetary\nscale transition. It was a multi-scale thing, that happened from the scale of chemistry, all the way to planetary cycles. It's happening now, all the way from individual\nhumans to the internet, which is a global technology, and all the other things. Like there's this multi-scale\nprocess that's happening and transitioning us globally. And it is really like\na dramatic transition. It's happening really fast. - And you think-\n- And we're living in it. - You think this\ntechnosphere that we created, this increasingly complex technosphere will spread to other planets. It'll just be-\n- I hope so. I think so - You think we'll become a type\ntwo Kardashev civilization? - I don't really like the Kardashev scale, and it goes back to like, I don't like a lot of the\nnarratives about life, 'cause they're very like, you\nknow, survival of the fittest, energy consuming this,\nthat and the other thing. It's very like, I don't\nknow, sort of old world, you know, like conqueror mentality. - What's the alternative to that exactly? - I mean, I think it does require life to use new energy sources in\norder to expand the way it is. So that part's accurate. But I think this sort of process of life like being the mechanism that the universe\ncreatively expresses itself, generates novelty, explores the space of the possible, is really the thing that's\nmost deeply intrinsic to life. And so, you know, these sort of energy consuming scales of technology, I think is missing the\nsort of actual feature that's most prominent about any alien life that we might find, which is that it's literally our universe, our reality, trying to\ncreatively express itself, and trying to find out what can exist and trying to make it exist. - See but past a certain level\nof complexity, unfortunately, maybe you can correct\nme, but we're built... All complex life on Earth is built on a foundation of\nthat predator prey dynamic. - Yes.\n- And so like, I don't know if we can escape that. I don't know-\n- No, we can't. But this is why I'm okay with having a finite lifetime. And, you know, one of the reasons I'm okay with that, actually-\n- Yeah. - Goes back to this issue of the fact that we're resource bound. We live in a... You know, like we have a\nfinite amount of material, whatever way you wanna define material. I think like for me, you\nknow, material is time, material is information, but we have a finite amount of material. If time is a generating mechanism, it's always gonna be finite, because the universe is, you know, like it's a resource\nthat's getting generated, but it has a size. Which means that all the\nthings that could exist don't exist, and in fact, most of them never will. So death is a way to\nmake room in the universe for other things to exist that wouldn't be able to exist otherwise. So if the universe, over\nits entire temporal history, wants to maximize the number of things... Wants is a hard word, maximize is a hard word, all\nthese things are approximate, but wants to maximize the\nnumber of things that can exist, the best way to do it is to make recursively embedded\nstacked objects like us, that have a lot of structure\nand a small volume of space. And to have those things\nturn over rapidly, so you can create as\nmany of them as possible. - So there for sure is a bunch of those kinds of\nthings throughout the universe. - Hopefully. Hopefully our universe\nis teaming with life. - This is like early on in\nthe conversation you mentioned that we really don't understand much. Like there's mystery all around us. - Yes.\n- If you had to like bet money on it, like what percent? So like say a million years from now, the story of science\nand human understanding that started on Earth, is written. Like, what chapter are we on? Is this like 1%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 90%? How much do we understand? Like the big stuff? Not like the details of like... Like big important questions- - Yeah.\n- And ideas. - I think we're in our twenties and- - 20% of the 20?\n- No, like age-wise. Let's say we're in our twenties, but the lifespan is gonna\nkeep getting longer. - You can't do that.\n- I can. You know why I use that though? I'll tell you why. Why my brain went there, is because you know, anybody that gets an education in physics, you know, has this sort of trope about how all the great\nphysicists did their best work in their twenties, and then you don't do\nany good work after that. And I always thought it was kind of funny, because for me physics is not complete, it's not nearly complete, but most physicists\nthink that we understand most of the structure of reality. And so I think I... Actually, I think I put\nthis in the book somewhere, but like this idea to me that societies would discover\neverything while they're young is very consistent with the way we talk\nabout physics right now. But I don't think that's actually the way that things are gonna go, and you're finding that people that are making major discoveries are getting older in some\nsense than they were, and our lifespan is also increasing. So I think there is something about age and your ability to learn, and how much of the world you can see, that's really important\nover a human lifespan, but also over the lifespan of societies. And so I don't know how\nbig the frontier is, I don't actually think it has a limit. I don't believe in infinity\nas a physical thing, but I think as a receding horizon, I think because the\nuniverse is getting bigger, you can never know all of it. - Well, I think it's about 1.7%. - 1.7, where does that come from? - And it's a finite... I don't know, I just made it up. But it's like-\n- That number had to come from somewhere. - I think seven is the thing\nthat people usually pick - 7%?\n- So I wanted to say 1%, but I thought it would be funnier- - Yeah, I see.\n- To add a point, you know, so inject a\nlittle humor in there. So the seven is for the humor, one is for how much mystery\nI think there is out there. - 99% mystery, 1% known? - In terms of like really\nbig important questions. - Yeah.\n- It's like, the list... Say there's gonna be like 200 chapters, like the stuff that's gonna remain true. - But you think the\nbook has a finite size? - Yeah, yeah.\n- And I don't. I mean, not that I believe in infinities, but I think the size\nof the book is growing. - Well, the fact that the\nsize of the book is growing is one of the chapters in the book. - Oh, there you go. Oh, we're being recursive. (laughs) - I think you have to, you\ncan't have an ever growing book. - Yes, you can.\n- I mean you just... I mean, I don't even... Because then-\n- Well, you couldn't have been asking this at the origin of life, right? Because obviously, like you wouldn't have\nexisted at the origin of life. - Right.\n- But like the question of intelligence and artificial general... Like those questions did not exist then. And they in part existed because the universe invented\na space for those questions to exist through evolution. - But like, I think that\nquestion will still stand a thousand years from now. - It will, but there\nwill be other questions we can't anticipate now,\nthat we'll be asking. - Yeah, and maybe we'll\ndevelop the kinds of languages that'll be able to ask\nmuch better questions. - Right, or like the theory of\nlike gravitation for example. Like when we invented that theory, like we only knew about the planets in our solar system, right? And now, you know, many centuries later, we know about all these planets around other stars and black holes, and other things that we\ncould never have anticipated. And then we can ask questions about them. You know, like we\nwouldn't have been asking about singularities and like, can they really be physical\nthings in the universe several hundred years ago\nthat question couldn't exist. - Yeah, but it's not... I still think those are\nchapters in the book. Like I don't get a sense from that."

      "text": "- So do you think the universe has an end? If you think it's a book with an end? - I think the number of\nwords required to describe how the universe works has an end, yes. (Lex laughs) Meaning like, I don't care\nif it's infinite or not. - Right.\n- As long as the explanation is simple and it exists. - Oh, I see. - And I think there is\na finite explanation for each aspect of it. The consciousness, the life. - Yeah.\n- I mean very probably, there's like some... The black hole thing is\nlike, what's going on there? - Oh, I know.\n- Where's that going? Like what are they... What? And then you know, why the Big Bang? Like what-\n- Right. - It's probably, there's just\na huge number of universes and it's like, universes inside universes-\n- You think so? I think universes inside\nuniverses is maybe possible. - I just think it's... Every time we assume this is all there is, it turns out there's much more. - The universe is a huge place - And we mostly talked about the past and the richness of the past. But the future, I mean with\nmany worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, so- - Oh, I'm not a many worlds person. - You're not?\n- No. Are you? How many Lexes are there? - Depending on the day. Well-\n- Do some of them wear yellow jackets? - At the moment you asked the question, there was one. At the moment I'm answering it, there's now near infinity, apparently. I mean the future is\nbigger than the past, yes? - Yes.\n- Okay, well there you go. And the past, according to\nyou, it's already gigantic. - Yeah, but yeah, I mean that's consistent\nwith many worlds, right? 'Cause like there's this\nconstant branching, so. But it doesn't really have\na directionality to it. I don't know, many worlds is weird. So my interpretation of reality is like if you folded up like all that bifurcation of many worlds, and you just fold it into\nthe structure that is you, and you just said, you are\nall of those many worlds and like that sort of, you\nknow, like your history, like converged on you. But like you're actually... An object exists that's like... That you know, was selected to exist, and you're self-consistent\nwith the other structures. So like the quantum mechanical reality is not the one that you live in. It's this very deterministic,\nclassical world and you're carving a\npath through that space. But I don't think that\nyou're constantly branching into new spaces. I think you are that space. - Wait, so to you at, at the\nbottom it's deterministic. I thought you said the universe- - No, it's random at the bottom, right? But like this randomness that we see at the bottom of reality,\nthat is quantum mechanics, I think like people have\nassumed that is reality. And what I'm saying is like all those things you see in many worlds, all those versions of you, just collect them up and bundle them up, and like they're all you. And what has happened is, you know, like elementary particles don't have... They don't live in a\ndeterministic universe, the things that we study\nin quantum experiments, they live in this fuzzy random space. But as that structure collapsed and started to build structures\nthat were deterministic and evolved into you, you are a very deterministic,\nmacroscopic object. And you can look down on that universe that doesn't have time in\nit, that random structure. And you can see that all\nof these possibilities look possible, but they don't look... They're not possible for you, because you're constrained by this giant like causal structural history. So you can't live in all those universes. You'd have to go all the way back to the very beginning of the universe, and retrace everything\nagain to be a different you. - So where's the source of the free will for the macro object? - It's the fact that you're\ndeterministic structure living in a random background, and also, all of that\nselection bundled in you, allows you to select on possible futures. So that's where your will comes from, and there's just always a\nlittle bit of randomness because the universe is getting bigger and you know, like this idea that the past and the present\nis not large enough yet to contain the future. The extra structure has\nto come from somewhere. And some of that is because, outside of those giant causal structures that are things like us, it's fucking random out there, (both laugh) and it's scary, and we're all hanging onto each other, because the only way to\nhang onto each other, like the only way to exist, is to like clinging on to all of these causal structures that we happen to\nco-inhabitate existence with, and try to keep reinforcing\neach other's existence. - All the selection bundled in. - But free will's totally\nconsistent with that. - I don't know what I think about that. That's complicated to imagine. Just that little bit of\nrandomness is enough. Okay. - Well it's also... It's not just the randomness. There's two features. One is, the randomness helps generate some novelty and some flexibility. But it's also that like, because you're the structure\nthat's deep in time, you have this combinatorial\nhistory that's you, and I think about time\nand assembly theory, not as linear time, but as combinatorial time. So if you have all of the structure that you're built out of, you in principle, you know, your future can be\ncombinations of that structure. You obviously need to persist\nyourself as a coherent you, so you wanna optimize for a common, like a future in that combinatorial space that still includes you, most of the time for most of us. And when you make those kinds... And then that gives you\na space to operate in, and that's your sort of horizon where your free will can operate, and your free will can't be instantaneous. So for like example, like I'm sitting here\ntalking to you right now, I can't be in the UK and\nI can't be in Arizona, but I could plan, I could\nexecute my free will over time, because free will is a\ntemporal feature of life, to be there, you know,\ntomorrow or the next day if I wanted to. - But what about like the\ninstantaneous decisions you're making? Like to, I don't know... To put your hand on the table, that's- - I think those were\nalready decided a while ago. I don't think that the... I don't think free will\nis ever instantaneous, - But on a longer time horizon- - Yep.\n- There's some kind of steering going on?\n- Mm-hmm. And who's doing the steering? - You are.\n- Hmm. And you being this macro\nobject that encompasses- - Or you being Lex. (laughs) Whatever you wanna call it. (laughs) - There you are, assigning\nwords to things once again. - I know.\n- Why does"

      "section": "Why anything exists",
      "text": "anything exist at all? - Ugh, I don't know.\n- You've kind of taken that as a starting point. - Yeah.\n- That it exists. - I think that's the hardest question. - Isn't it just hard questions\nstacked on top of each other? - It is.\n- Wouldn't it be the same kind of question\nof, what is life? It is the same. Well that's sort of like, I try to fold all of the\nquestions into that question, 'cause I think that one's really hard, and I think the nature of\nexistence is really hard. - You think actually like\nanswering, what is life? Will help us understand existence? Maybe it's turtles all the way down and it'll just... Understanding the nature of turtles will help us kind of march down even if we don't have the\nexperimental methodology of reaching before the Big Bang. - Right. So, well I think there's\nsort of two questions embedded here. I think the one that we can't\nanswer by answering life is, why certain things exist and others don't. But I think the sort of ultimate question, the sort of like prime mover question of why anything exists, we will not be able to answer. - What's outside the universe? - Oh, there's nothing\noutside the universe. So I am a very, like... I am like the most physicalist\nthat like anyone could be. So like for me, everything\nexists in our universe and I like to like think it like, everything exists here. So even when we talk about\nthe multiverse, I don't... Like, to me it's not like\nthere's all these other universes outside of our universe that exists. The multiverse is a concept\nthat exists in human minds here, and it allows us to have\nsome counterfactual reasoning to reason about our own cosmology, and therefore it's causal in our biosphere to understanding the\nreality that we live in, and building better theories. But I don't think that the\nmultiverse is something like... And also math. Like I don't think\nthere's a platonic world that mathematical things live in. I think mathematical things\nare here on this planet. Like I don't think it makes\nsense to talk about things that exist outside of the universe. If you're talking about them, you're already talking\nabout something that exists inside the universe, and\nis part of the universe, and is part of like what\nthe universe is building. - It all originates here. It all exists here in some- - I mean, what else would there be? - There could be things you\ncan't possibly understand outside of all of this\nthat we call the universe. - And you can say that, and that's an interesting philosophy, but again, this is sort of\nlike pushing on the boundaries of like the way that we understand things. I think it's more constructive to say the fact that I can\ntalk about those things is telling me something about the structure of\nwhere I actually live and where I exist.\n- Just because it's more constructive\ndoesn't mean it's true. - Well, it may not be true. It may be something that allows\nme to build better theories I can test, to try to\nunderstand something objective. - And in the end, that's a\ngood way to get to the truth. - Exactly.\n- Even if you realize- - So I can't do experiments-\n- You were wrong in the past. - Yeah. So there's no such thing\nas experimental Platonism, but if you think math is an object that emerged in our biosphere, you can start experimenting\nwith that idea. And that to me is really interesting. Like to think about... Well people, I mean, mathematicians do think about math sometimes\nas an experimental science, but to think about math\nitself as a object for study by physicists, rather than a tool physicists\nused to describe reality, it becomes the part of reality\nthey're trying to describe, to me is a deeply interesting inversion. - What to you is most beautiful about this kind of exploration\nof the physics of life that you've been doing? - I love the way it makes me feel. - And then you have to try to convert the feelings into visuals and the visuals into words?\n- Yeah. So I think I love... Yeah, I love the way it\nmakes me feel to have ideas that I think are novel. And I think that the dual side of that is the painful process of\ntrying to communicate that with other human beings, to test if they have any\nkind of reality to them. And I also love that process. I love trying to figure out how to explain really\ndeep, abstract things that I don't think that we understand, and trying to understand\nthem with other people. And I also love the shock value of you... Like this kind of idea we\nwere talking about before, of like being on the boundary\nof like what we understand, and so people can kind of\nsee what you're seeing, but they haven't ever\nsaw it that way before. And I love the shock value\nthat like people have, like that immediate moment of recognizing that there's something beyond the way that they thought about things before. And being able to deliver that to people, I think is one of the biggest joys that I have, it's just like... And maybe it's that sense of mystery, like to share that there's something beyond the frontier of how we understand, and we might be able to see it. - And you get to see\nthe humans transformed- - Yeah.\n- Like a new idea? - Yes. And I think my greatest wish in life is to somehow contribute to an idea that transforms the way that we think. Like, you know, I have\nmy problem I wanna solve, but like the thing that\ngives me joy about it is really changing something, and ideally getting to\na deeper understanding of how the world works and what we are. - Yeah, I would say understanding\nlife at a deep level- - Yeah.\n- Is probably one of the most exciting problems. One of the most exciting questions. So I'm glad you are trying\nto answer just that, and doing it in style. (Sara laughs) - It's the only way to do anything. - Thank you so much for\nthis amazing conversation. Thank you for being you,\nSara.

  "full_text": "- So you have an original life event. It evolves for 4 billion\nyears, at least on our planet. It evolves a technosphere. The technologies themselves start having this property we call life, which is the phase we're undergoing now. It solves the origin of itself, and then it figures out\nhow that process all works, understands how to make more life and then can copy itself\nonto another planet, so the whole structure\ncan reproduce itself. - The following is a\nconversation with Sara Walker, her third time in this podcast. She is an astrobiologist\nand theoretical physicist, interested in the origin of life and in discovering alien\nlife on other worlds. She has written an amazing\nnew upcoming book titled, \"Life as No One Knows It: The\nPhysics of Life's Emergence.\" This book is coming out on August 6th, so please go pre-order it now. It will blow your mind. This is a Lex Fridman podcast, to support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Sara Walker. You open the book, \"Life\nas No One Knows It: The Physics of Life's Emergence,\" with the distinction\nbetween the materialists and the vitalists. So what's the difference?\nCan you maybe define the two? - I think the question there is about whether life can be\ndescribed in terms of matter and you know, physical things, or whether there is some other feature, that's not physical, that\nactually animates living things. So for a long time people\nmaybe have called that a soul. It's been really hard to\npin down what that is. So I think the vitalist\nidea is really that, it's kind of a dualistic interpretation, that there's sort of\nthe material properties, but there's something\nelse that animates life that is there when you're alive and it's not there when you're dead. And materialists kind of don't think that there's anything really special about the matter of life and the material substrates\nthat life is made out of. So they disagree on some\nreally fundamental points. - Is there a gray area between the two? Like maybe all there is is matter, but there's so much we don't know that it might as well be magic? (Sara laughs) That like whatever that\nmagic that the vitalists see. Meaning like-\n- Yeah. - There's just so much mystery that it's really unfair\nto say that it's boring and understood, and as simple\nas quote unquote \"physics.\" - Yeah, I think the entire\nuniverse is just a giant mystery. I guess that's what\nmotivates me as a scientist. And so oftentimes when\nI look at open problems like the nature of life or consciousness, or you know, what is intelligence? Or are there souls? Or whatever question that we have, that we feel like we aren't even on the tip of answering yet. I think, you know, we\nhave a lot more work to do to really understand the\nanswers to these questions. So it's not magic, it's just the unknown. And I think a lot of the history of humans coming to understand the world around us has been taking ideas that\nwe once thought were magic or supernatural, and really understanding\nthem in a much deeper way, that we learn what those things are, and they still have an air of mystery even when we understand them. There's no sort of bottom\nto our understanding. - So do you think the\nvitalists have a point, that they're more eager and able to notice the magic of life? - I think that no tradition,\nvitalists included, is ever fully wrong about the nature of the things\nthat they're describing. So a lot of times when\nI look at different ways that people have described\nthings across human history, across different cultures, there's always a seed of truth in them, and I think it's really important\nto try to look for those, because if there are narratives that humans have been telling ourselves for thousands of years, for\nthousands of generations, there must be some truth to them. You know, we've been\nlearning about reality for a really long time, and we recognize the patterns\nthat reality presents us, we don't always understand\nwhat those patterns are. And so I think it's really important to pay attention to that. So I don't think the\nvitalists were actually wrong, and a lot of what I\ntalk about in the book, but also I think about a\nlot just professionally, is the nature of our\ndefinitions of what's material, and how science has come to\ninvent the concept of matter. And that some of those things\nactually really are inventions that happened in a particular time, in a particular technology that could learn about certain patterns and help us understand them, and that there are some patterns\nwe still don't understand. And if we knew how to measure those things or we knew how to describe\nthem in a more rigorous way, we would realize that the\nmaterial world, matter, has more properties than\nwe thought that it did. And one of those might be associated with the thing that we call life. Life could be a material property and still have a lot of the features that the vitalists\nthought were mysterious. - So we may still expand our understanding what is incorporated in\nthe category of matter that will eventually\nincorporate such magical things that the vitalists have noticed- - Yeah-\n- Like life. - Yeah, so I think about... I always like to use\nexamples from physics, so I'll probably do that to, (laughs) Like it's my go-to place. But you know, in the history\nof gravitational physics, for example, in the history of motion, you know like when Aristotle came up with his theories of motion, he did it by the material\nproperties he thought things had. So there was a concept of\nthings falling to Earth because they were solid-like, and things raising to the\nheavens 'cause they were airlike, and things moving around the planet 'cause they were celestial-like. But then we came to realize\nthat thousands of years later and after the invention\nof many technologies that allowed us to actually measure time in a mechanistic way and\ntrack planetary motion, and we could, you know, roll\nballs down inclined planes and track that progress. We realized that if we\njust talked about mass and acceleration, we could\nunify all motion in the universe in a really simple description. So we didn't really have\nto worry about the fact that my cup is heavy and the air is light, like the same laws describe them, if we have the right material\nproperties to talk about what those laws are\nactually interacting with. And so I think the issue with life is, we don't know how to\nthink about information in a material way. And so we haven't been able\nto build a unified description of what life is or the kind of things\nthat evolution builds, because we haven't really invented the right material concept yet. - So when talking about motion, the laws of physics appear to be the same everywhere out in the universe. You think the same is true\nfor other kinds of matter that we might eventually include life in? - I think life obeys universal principles. I think there is some deep\nunderlying exploratory framework that will tell us about the\nnature of life in the universe and will allow us to identify life that we can't yet recognize\nbecause it's too different. - You write about the\nparadox of defining life. Why does this seem to be so easy and so complicated at the same time? - You know, all the sort\nof classic definitions people want to use just don't work. They don't work in all cases. So Carl Sagan had this wonderful essay on definitions of life, where I think he talks about aliens coming from another planet, If they saw Earth, they might think that cars\nwere the dominant life form because there's so many\nof them on our planet, and like humans are inside them, and you might wanna exclude machines, but any definition, you know, like classic biology textbook definitions would also include them. And so, you know, he\nwanted to draw a boundary between these kind of things\nby trying to exclude them, but they were naturally included by the definitions people wanna give. And in fact, what he ended up pointing out is that all of the definitions\nof life that we have, whether it's, life is a\nself reproducing system, or life eats to survive, or life requires\ncompartments, whatever it is, there's always a counter example that challenges that definition. This is why viruses are so\nhard or why fire is so hard. And so we've had a really hard time trying to pin down, from a\ndefinitional perspective, exactly what life is. - Yeah, you actually bring\nup the zombie-ant fungus. I enjoyed looking at this thing, (Sara laughs)\nas an example of one of the challenges. You mentioned viruses,\nbut this is a parasite. Look at that. - Did you see this in jungle?\n- In fact, ants... Actually one of the interesting\nthings about the jungle, that everything is ephemeral. Like everything eats\neverything really quickly. So if an organism dies,\nthat organism disappears. - Yeah.\n- It's a machine that doesn't have... I wanted to say it doesn't\nhave a memory or a history, which is interesting\ngiven your work on history in defining a living being. The jungle forgets very quickly. It wants to erase the fact\nthat you existed very quickly. - Yeah, but it can't erase it,\nit's just restructuring it. And I think the other thing\nthat is really, you know, vivid to me about this\nexample that you're giving is, how much death is necessary for life. So I worry a bit about\nnotions of immortality and whether immortality\nis a good thing or not. So I have sort of a broad conception that life is the only thing\nthe universe generates that actually has even the\npotential to be immortal. But that's as like the sort of process that you're describing, where life is about memory\nand historical contingency, and construction of new possibilities. But when you look at any instance of life, especially one as dynamic\nas what you're describing, it's a constant birth and death process. But that birth and death process is like, the way that the universe can explore what possibilities can exist, and not everything, not\nevery possible human or every possible ant or\nevery possible zombie ant or every possible tree will ever live. So it's, you know, it's\nan incredibly dynamic and creative place\nbecause of all that death. - So does this thing... This is a parasite that needs the ant. So is this a living thing or is this not a living thing? So this is- - Yeah, so-\n- It just pierces the ant. I mean it-\n- Right. - And I've seen a lot of this by the way, organisms working together in the jungle, like ants protecting a\ndelicious piece of fruit. So they need the fruit. But like if you touch that fruit, they're going to like... The forces emerge. - Yeah.\n- They're fighting you, they're defending that fruit. - Right.\n- To the death. Nature seems to find\nmutual benefits, right? - Yeah, it does. I think the thing that's perplexing for me about these kind of examples is, you know, effectively the ant's dead\nbut it's staying alive now 'cause it's piloted by this fungus. And so that gets back to this, you know, thing that we're talking\nabout a few minutes ago about how the boundary of\nlife is really hard to define. So you know, anytime that\nyou wanna draw a boundary around something and you say, \"This feature is the thing\nthat makes this alive,\" or \"This thing is alive on its own,\" there's not ever really a clear boundary, and these kind of examples are\nreally good at showing that, because it's like the thing\nthat you would've thought is the living organism is now dead, except that it has another living organism that's piloting it. So the two of them together\nare alive in some sense, but they're, you know, now in this kind of weird\nsymbiotic relationship that's taking this ant to its death. - So what do you do with that in terms of when you try to define life? - I think we have to get rid of the notion of an individual as being relevant. And this is really difficult because you know, a lot of the ways that we think about life, like the fundamental\nunit of life is the cell, individuals are alive, but we don't think about how\ngray that distinction is. So for example, you might consider, you know, self reproduction to be the most defining feature\nof life, a lot of people do. Actually like it's, you know, one of these standard\ndifferent definitions that a lot of people\nin my field like to use in astrobiology is, life is a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution. Which I was once quoted as agreeing with, and I was really offended,\nbecause I hate that definition. I think it's terrible, and I think it's terrible\nthat people use it. I think like every word in that definition is actually wrong as a descriptor of life. - Life is a self-sustaining\nchemical system capable of Darwinian evolution. Why is that... That seems like a pretty good definition. - Yeah, I know. If you wanna make me angry\nyou can pretend I said that, (Sara laughs) and believed it. - So self-sustaining chemical system, Darwinian evolution. What is self-sustaining?\nWhat's so frustrating? I mean which aspect is frustrating to you, but it's also, those are\nvery interesting words. - Yeah, they're all interesting words and you know, together\nthey sound really smart and they sound like they\nbox in what life is. But you can use any of\nthe words individually and you can come up with counter examples that don't fulfill that property. The self-sustaining one\nis really interesting, thinking about humans, right? Like we're not self-sustaining, we're dependent on societies. And so, you know, I find\nit paradoxical that, you know, it might be that societies, because they are self-sustaining units, are now more alive than individuals are. And that could be the case. But I still think we have some property associated with life. I mean that's the thing that\nwe're trying to describe. So that one's quite hard. And in general, you know, no organism is really self-sustaining. They always require an environment. So being self-sustaining\nis coupled, in some sense, to the world around you. We don't live in a vacuum, so that part's already challenging, and then you can go to chemical system. I don't think that's good either. I think there's a confusion because life emerges in\nchemistry, that life is chemical. I don't think life is chemical. I think life emerges in chemistry because chemistry is the first\nthing the universe builds where it cannot exhaust\nall the possibilities, because the combinatorial space\nof chemistry is too large. - Well but is it possible to have a life that is not a chemical system? - Yes. - Well, there's a guy I\nknow named Lee Cronin, he's been on the podcast a couple times. He just got really pissed off-\n- I know that guy too- - Listening to this. (laughs)\n- What a coincidence. He probably just got really\npissed off hearing that. For people who somehow\ndon't know, he's a chemist. - Yeah, but he would\nagree with that statement. - Would he? I don't think he would. I don't think he would. He would broaden the\ndefinition of chemistry until it'll include everything. - Oh sure.\n- Okay, so you're- - Or maybe, I don't know,\n- But wait, but you said that universe, the first thing it creates is chemistry. - Very precisely, it's not the first thing it creates, obviously like, it has\nto make atoms first, but it's the first thing, like if you think about, you know, the universe originated, atoms were made in, you know,\nBig Bang nucleosynthesis, and then later in stars,\nand then planets formed, and planets become engines of chemistry. They start exploring what\nkind of chemistry is possible. And the combinatorial space\nof chemistry is so large that even on every planet\nin the entire universe, you will never express\nevery possible molecule. I like this example\nactually that Lee gave me, which is to think about Taxol, it has a molecular weight of about 853. It's got, you know, a lot of atoms but it's not astronomically large. And if you try to make one molecule with that molecular formula in every three dimensional\nshape you could make with that molecular formula, it would fill 1.5 universes in volume. So with one unique molecule,\nthat's just one molecule. So chemical space is huge, and I think it's really\nimportant to recognize that, because if you wanna ask a question of, why does life emerge in chemistry? Well life emerges in chemistry because life is the physics\nof how the universe selects what gets to exist. And those things get created along historically contingent\npathways and memory and all the other stuff\nthat we can talk about. But the universe has to actually make historically contingent\nchoices in chemistry, 'cause it can't exhaust\nall possible molecules. - What kind of things can you create that's outside the combinatorial\nspace of chemistry? That's what I'm trying to understand- - Oh, if it's not chemical. So I think some of the things that have evolved on our biosphere, I would call as much alive\nas chemistry, as a cell, but they seem much more abstract. So for example, I think language is alive. I think, or at least life. I think memes are. I think-\n- You're saying language is life? - Yes.\n- Language is alive. Oh boy, I'm gonna have\nto explore that one. (Sara laughs) Okay, but-\n- Life, maybe not alive, but I don't... Actually, I don't know where\nI stand exactly on that. I've been thinking about that\na little bit more lately. But mathematics too, and it's interesting, 'cause people think that math\nhas this platonic reality that exists outside of our universe. And I think it's a\nfeature of our biosphere, and it's telling us something about the structure of ourselves. And I find that really interesting, 'cause when you would sort of internalize all of these things that\nwe noticed about the world and you start asking, \"Well,\nwhat do these look like if I was, you know,\nsomething outside of myself, observing these systems\nthat all embedded in, what would that structure look like?\" And I think we look really different than the way that we talk about what we look like to each other. - What do you think a\nliving organism in math is? Is it one axiomatic system or is it individual theorems or is it- - I think it's the fact that\nit's open-ended in some sense. It's another open-ended\ncombinatorial space. And the recursive properties of it allow creativity to happen. Which is what you see with, you know, like the revolution in the last century with Godel's theorem\nand Turing and you know, there's clear places where mathematics notices\nholes in the universe. - So it seems like you're sneaking up on a different kind of definition of life. Open-ended, large combinatorial space. - Yeah.\n- Room for creativity. - Definitely not chemical. I mean chemistry is one substrate.\n- Restrict to chemical. - Yeah.\n- Chemical. Okay, what about the third thing, which I think would be the hardest, 'cause you probably like\nit the most, is evolution or selection. - Well, specifically\nit's Darwinian evolution. - Darwinian, okay.\n- And I think Darwinian evolution is a problem. But the reason that that\ndefinition is a problem is not because evolution\nis in the definition, but because the implication\nis that, you know, that most people would wanna make is that an individual is alive. And the evolutionary process, at least the Darwinian\nevolutionary process and most evolutionary processes, they don't happen at the\nlevel of individuals, they happen at the level of population. So again, you would be saying something, like what we saw with the\nself-sustaining definition, which is that populations are alive, but individuals aren't, because populations evolve\nand individuals don't. And obviously like maybe you are alive because you know, your gut\nmicrobiome is evolving. But Lex as an entity\nright now is not evolving by canonical theories of evolution. In assembly theory, which is attempting to explain life, evolution is a much broader thing, so- - So an individual organism can evolve under assembly theory. - Yes, you're constructing\nyourself all the time. Assembly theory is about construction and how the universe\nselects for things to exist. - What if you reformulate everything? Like a population is\na living organism, so- - That's fine too.\n- Right. - But this again gets back to... So I think what all of the... You know, like we can\nnitpick at definitions. I don't think it's like\nincredibly helpful to do it. But the reason for me-\n- It's fun. - Yeah, it is fun. It is really fun. And actually I do think it's useful, in the sense that when you see the ways that they all break down, you either have to keep forcing in, your like sort of conception\nof life you want to have, or you have to say, \"All these definitions are\nbreaking down for a reason. Maybe I should adopt a\nmore expansive definition that encompasses all the things\nthat I think and our life.\" And so for me, I think life is the process of how information structures\nmatter over time and space, and an example of life is\nwhat emerges on a planet and yields an open-ended cascade\nof generation of structure and increasing complexity, and this is the thing that life is. And any individual is\njust a particular instance of these lineages that are, you know, structured across time. And so we focus so much\non these individuals that are these short temporal moments in this larger causal structure that actually is the life on our planet. And I think that's why these\ndefinitions break down, because they're not general enough, they're not universal enough,\nthey're not deep enough, they're not abstract enough to actually capture that regularity. - Because we're focused on\nthat little ephemeral thing. - Yeah, it's like-\n- That we call human life? - Aristotle focusing on, you know, heavy things falling\nbecause they're earth-like, and you know, things floating\n'cause they're airlike, it's the wrong thing to focus on. - So what exactly are we missing by focusing on such a short span of time? - I think we're missing\nmost of what we are. So one of the issues, I've been thinking about this like really viscerally lately, it's weird when you do\ntheoretical physics, because I think it like literally changes the structure of your brain, (laughs) and you see the world differently, especially when you're trying\nto build new abstractions. - Do you think it's possible, if you're a theoretical physicist, that like it's easy to fall off the cliff and go descend into madness? - I mean I think you're\nalways on the edge of it, but I think what is amazing\nabout being a scientist and trying to do things rigorously,\nis it keeps your sanity. So I think if I wasn't\na theoretical physicist, I would be probably not sane, but what it forces you\nto do is hold the... Like you have to hold\nyourself to the fire of like, these abstractions in my mind have to really correspond to reality, and I have to really\ntest that all the time. And so I love building new abstractions and I love going to those\nlike incredibly creative, you know, spaces that people don't see as part of the way that we\nunderstand the world now. But ultimately, I have to make sure that whatever I'm pulling from that space is something that's really usable and really like relates to\nthe world outside of me. That's what science is. - So we were talking about what we're missing when we\nlook at a small stretch of time in a small stretch of space. - Yeah. So the issue is, we evolve perception to see reality a certain way, right? So for us, space is really important and time feels fleeting and I, you know, I had a really wonderful\nmentor, Paul Davies, most of my career. And Paul's amazing because\nhe gives these like little seed thought\nexperiments all the time. Like, you know, something\nhe used to ask me all the time when I was a postdoc, this is kind of a random tangent, but was like, you know,\nhow much of the universe could be converted into technology? If you were thinking about like, you know, long-term futures and stuff like that. And it's like a weird thought experiment but like, there's a lot\nof deep things there. But I do think a lot about the fact that, we're really limited in our\ninteractions with reality by the particular\narchitectures that we evolved, and so we're not seeing everything. And in fact our technology\ntells us this all the time because it allows us to\nsee the world in new ways by basically allowing\nus to perceive the world in ways that we couldn't otherwise. And so what I'm getting at with this is, I think that living\nobjects are actually huge. Like there're some of\nthe biggest structures in the universe, but they\nare not big in space, they're big in time. And we actually can't\nresolve that feature. We don't interact with\nit on a regular basis. So we see them as these fleeting things that have this really\nshort temporal clock time without seeing how large they are. When I'm saying time here, I really like the way that\npeople could picture it is in terms of causal structure. So if you think about the\nhistory of the universe to get to you, and you imagine that that\nentire history is you, that is the picture I have in my mind when I look at every living thing. - So you have a tweet for everything. (Sara laughs)\nYou tweeted- - Doesn't everyone? - You have a lot of\npoetic, profound tweets. Sometimes-\n- Thank you. - They're puzzles that take\na long time to figure out. - Well you know what the trick is, the reason they're hard to write is because it's compressing\na very deep idea into a short amount of space, and I really like doing\nthat intellectual exercise, 'cause I find it productive for me. - Yeah, it's a very\ninteresting kind of compression algorithm though. - Yeah, I like language. I think it's really fun to play with. - Yeah, I wonder if AI can decompress it. That'd be interesting- - I would like to try this, but I think I use language in certain ways that are non-canonical, and\nI do it very purposefully, and it would be interesting to\nme how AI would interpret it. - Yeah, your tweets would\nbe a good Turing test. - There you go.\n- For a super intelligence. Anyway, you tweeted that,\n\"Things only look emergent because we can't see time. So if we could see time, what\nwould the world look like?\" You're saying you would\nbe able to see everything that an object has been, every step of the way that\nled to this current moment, and all the interactions that are required to make that evolution happen. You would see this gigantic tale. - The universe is far larger\nin time than it is in space. - Yeah.\n- And this planet is one of the biggest\nthings in the universe. - Oh, so the more complexity, the bigger- - Yeah, so like the technosphere, I think the modern technosphere is the largest object in time in the universe that we know about. - And when you say\ntechnosphere, what do you mean? - I mean the global integration of life and technology on this planet. - So all the things, all the technological\nthings we've created? - Mm-hmm, but I don't\nthink of them as separate. They're like very integrated with the structure that generated them. So you can almost imagine it, like time is constantly bifurcating, and it's generating new structures, and these new structures are, you know, locally constructing the future. And so things like you and I are very close together in time, 'cause we didn't diverge like very early in the history of\nuniverse, it's very recent. And I think this is one of the reasons that we can understand each other so well and we can communicate effectively. And I might have some sense of\nwhat it feels like to be you, but you know, other\norganisms bifurcated from us in time earlier, this is just the concept\nof phylogeny, right? But if you take that deeper and you really think about that as the structure of the\nphysics that generates life, and you take that very seriously, all of that causation is still bundled up in the objects we observe today. And so you and I are are close\nin this temporal structure, but we're also... And we're so close\nbecause we're really big, and we only are very different in sort of like the most\nrecent moments in the time that's like embedded in us. It's hard to use words to visualize what's in minds. (laughs) I have such a hard time\nwith this sometimes. I'm like, I like... I actually was thinking\non the way over here, I was like, you know, you\nhave pictures in your brain and then they're hard to put into words, but I realized I always\nsay I have a visual, but it's not actually I have a visual. It's, I have a feeling, 'cause oftentimes I cannot\nactually draw a picture in my mind for the things that I say, but sometimes they go through a picture before they get to words, but I like experimenting with words because I think they help paint pictures. - Yeah, it's again, some\nkind of compressed feeling that you can query to get a sense of the bigger visualization that you have in mind. - Yeah.\n- It's just like a really nice compression. But I think the idea of this object that in it contains all the\ninformation about the history of an entity that you see now, just trying to visualize\nthat is pretty cool. - Yeah.\n- I mean obviously the mind breaks down\nquickly as you step seconds and minutes back in time.\n- Yeah, for sure - I guess it's just a gigantic object- - Yeah.\n- What you're supposed to be thinking about. - Yeah, I think so, and I think this is one of the reasons that we have such an ability\nto abstract as humans, because we are so gigantic, that like the space\nthat we can go back into is really large. So like the more abstract you're going, like the deeper you're\ngoing in that space. - But in that sense, aren't we\nfundamentally all connected? - Yes, and this is why\nthe definition of life cannot be the individual, it has to be these lineages, because they're all\nconnected, they're interwoven, and they're exchanging parts all the time. - Yeah, so maybe there's certain\naspects of those lineages that can be lifelike, they\ncan be characteristics, they can be measured like with\nassembly theory that have- - Yeah.\n- More or less life, but they're all just fingertips of a- - Yeah.\n- Of a much bigger object. - Yeah, I think life is\nvery high dimensional. And in fact I think you can\nbe alive in some dimensions and not in others. Like if you could\nproject all the causation that's in you in some\nfeatures of you, you know, very little causation is required,\nlike very little history, and in some features a lot is. So it's quite difficult to take this really high\ndimensional, very deep structure, and project it into things\nthat we really can understand and say like, \"This is the\none thing that we're seeing,\" because it's not one thing. - It's funny, we're talking about this now and I'm slowly starting to realize, one of the things I saw\nwhen I took ayahuasca, afterwards actually, so the actual ceremony\nis four or five hours, but afterwards you're still riding whatever the thing that you're riding. And I got a chance to, afterwards, hang out with some friends and just shoot the shit in\nthe, you know, in the forest. And I get to see their faces. And what was happening with their faces and their hair is, I would\nget this interesting effect. First of all, everything was beautiful and I just had so much love for everybody. But I could see their past\nselves like behind them. It was this effect where... I guess it's a blurring effect? Of where like if I move like this, the faces that were just\nthere are still there and it would just float like this, behind them, which will\ncreate this incredible effect. But it's also another way\nto think about that is, I'm visualizing a little\nbit of that object, of the thing they were\njust a few seconds ago. - Yeah.\n- It's a cool little effect. - That's very cool. - And now it's like giving\nit a bit more profundity to the effect that was just\nbeautiful aesthetically, but it's also beautiful\nfrom a physics perspective, because that is a past self. I get a little glimpse at the past selves that they were, but then you take that to its natural conclusion,\nnot just a few seconds ago, but just to the beginning of the universe, and you can probably get to that-\n- Yeah, billions of years, yeah.\n- Get down that lineage. - It's crazy that\nthere's billions of years inside all of us. - All of us.\n- Yeah. - And then we connect obviously. - Yeah.\n- Not too long ago. - Yeah. - You mentioned just the technosphere and you also wrote that, \"The most alive thing on this planet is our technosphere.\" - Yeah.\n- Why is the technology we create a kind of life form? Why are you seeing it as life? - Because it's creative, but with us obviously, like\nnot independently of us, and also because of this\nsort of lineage view of life, and I think about life often as a planetary scale phenomena, 'cause that's sort of the natural boundary for all of this causation that's bundled in every object in our biosphere. And so for me, it's just\nsort of the current boundary of how far life on our planet has pushed into the things that our\nuniverse can generate. And so it's the furthest\nthing, it's the biggest thing. And I think a lot about the nature of life across different scales. And so, you know, we have cells\ninside of us that are alive and we feel like we're alive, but we don't often think\nabout the societies that we're embedded in as alive or a global scale organization of us and our technology on the planet as alive. But I think if you have this deeper view into the nature of life, which I think is necessary also\nto solve the origin of life, then you have to include those things. - All of them. So you have to simultaneously think about- - Every scale\n- Life at every single scale. - Yeah.\n- The planetary and the bacteria level. - Yeah, this is the hard thing about solving the problem of life, I think, is how many things you have to integrate into building a sort of a unified picture of this thing that we wanna call life, and a lot of our theories of physics are built on building deep regularities that explain a really\nbroad class of phenomenon. And I think we haven't\nreally traditionally thought about life that\nway, but I think to get at some of these hardest questions, like looking for life on other planets or the origin of life, you really have to\nthink about it that way. And so most of like my professional work is just trying to understand\nlike every single thing on this planet that might\nbe an example of life, which is pretty much everything, and then trying to figure out like, what's the deeper\nstructure underlying that. - Yeah, Schrodinger wrote that, \"Living matter, while not\neluding the laws of physics as established up to date, is likely to involve other laws of physics hitherto unknown.\" So to him- - I love that quote. - There was a sense that, at the bottom of this\nare new laws of physics that could explain this\nthing that we call life. - Yeah, Schrodinger really tried to do what physicists try to do, which is explain things, and his attempt was to try to explain life in terms of non-equilibrium physics, because he thought that\nwas the best description that we could generate at the time. And so he did come up with\nsomething really insightful, which was to predict the structure of DNA as an aperiodic crystal. And that was for a very\nprecise reason that, you know, that was the only kind\nof physical structure that could encode enough information to actually specify a cell. We knew some things about\ngenes, but not about DNA and its actual structure\nwhen he proposed that. But in the book he tried to explain, life is kind of going against entropy. And so some people talked about it as like Schrodinger's paradox, how can life persist when the second law of\nthermodynamics is there? But in open systems\nthat's not so problematic. And really, the question is, why can life generate so much order? And we don't have a\nphysics to describe that. And it's interesting, you know, generations of physicists have\nthought about this problem. Oftentimes it's like\nwhen people are retiring, they're like, \"Oh, now\nI can work on life.\" Or they're like more\nsenior in their career and they worked on other\nmore traditional problems. And there's still a lot of\nimpetus in the physics community to think that non-equilibrium\nphysics will explain life, but I think that's not the right approach. I don't think ultimately the solution to what life is is there, and I don't really think\nentropy has much to do with it unless it's entirely reformulated. - Well, because you have to\nexplain how interesting order, how complexity emerges from the soup. - Yes, from randomness. - From randomness. Physics currently can't do that. - No, Physics hardly even acknowledges that the universe is random\nat its base. (laughs) We like to think we live\nin a deterministic universe and everything's deterministic. But I think that's probably, you know, an artifact of the way\nthat we've written down laws of physics since Newton\ninvented modern physics and his conception of motion\nand gravity, which, you know, he formulated laws that\nhad initial conditions and fixed dynamical laws, and that's sort of\nbecome the standard canon of how people think the universe works and how we need to describe\nany physical system, is with an initial condition\nand a law of motion. And I think that's not actually the way the universe really works. I think it's a good approximation\nfor the kind of systems that physicists have studied so far. And I think it will radically fail in the long term at describing reality at its more basal levels, but I'm not saying there's a base, I don't think that reality has a ground and I don't think there's\na theory of everything, but I think there are better theories, and I think there are\nmore explanatory theories, and I think we can get to something that explains much more than\nthe current laws of physics do. - When you say theory of everything, you mean like everything, everything. - Yeah, you know, like\nin physics right now, it's really popular to talk\nabout theories of everything. So string theory is supposed\nto be a theory of everything because it unifies quantum\nmechanics and gravity, and you know, people have their different\npet theories of everything, and the challenge with\na theory of everything, I really love this quote\nquote from David Krakauer, which is, \"A theory of everything is a theory of everything except those things that theorize.\" - Oh, you mean removing the\nobserver from the thing? - Yeah, but it's also weird because if a theory of\neverything explained everything, it should also explain the theory. So the theory has to be recursive, and none of our theories\nof physics are recursive. So it's a weird concept. - Yeah, but it's very difficult to integrate the observer into a theory. - I don't think so. I think you can build\na theory acknowledging that you're an observer\ninside the universe, - But doesn't it become\nrecursive in that way? And you're saying it's\npossible to make a theory that's okay with that? - I think so. I mean, I don't think... There's always gonna be the paradox of another meta level you could build on the meta level, right? So like if you assume\nthis is your universe and you're the observer outside of it, you have some meta\ndescription of that universe, but then you need a meta description of you describing that universe, right? So, you know, this is one\nof the biggest challenges that we face being observers\ninside our universe. And also, you know, why the paradoxes and the foundations of mathematics and any place that we try to\nhave observers in the system or a system describing itself show up. But I think it is possible\nto build a physics that builds in those things intrinsically, without having them be paradoxical or have holes in the descriptions. And so one place I think\nabout this quite a lot, which I think can give you sort\nof a more concrete example, is the nature of like\nwhat we call fundamental. So we typically define\nfundamental right now in terms of the smallest\nindivisible units of matter. So again, you have to have a definition of what you think material\nis, and matter is, but right now the, you know, what's fundamental are\nelementary particles, and we think they're fundamental, because we can't break them apart further, and obviously we have\ntheories like string theory that if they're right, would\nreplace the current description of what's the most fundamental\nthing in our universe by replacing it with something smaller, but we can't get to those theories, because we're technologically limited. And so if you look at this\nfrom a historical perspective and you think about explanations changing as physical systems like us learn more about the\nreality in which they live, we once considered atoms to\nbe the most fundamental thing. And you know, it literally\ncomes from the word indivisible. And then we realized\natoms had substructure because we built better technology, which allowed us to quote\nunquote, \"see the world better,\" and resolve smaller features of it. And then we built even better technology, which allowed us to see\neven smaller structure and get down to the\nstandard model particles. And we think that there might\nbe structure below that, but we can't get there\nyet with our technology. So what's fundamental, the way we talk about\nit in current physics is not actually fundamental. It's the boundaries of what we\ncan observe in our universe, what we can see with our technology. And so if you wanna build\na theory that's about us and about what's inside the universe that we can observe, not\nwhat's at the boundary of it, you need to talk about objects\nthat are in the universe, that you can actually break\napart to smaller things. So I think the things that are fundamental are actually the constructed objects. They're the ones that really exist and you really understand\ntheir properties, because you know how the\nuniverse constructed them, because you can actually take them apart. You can understand the\nintrinsic laws that built them, but the things at the boundary\nare just at the boundary, they're evolving with us, and we'll learn more about\nthat structure as we go along. But really, if we wanna talk\nabout what's fundamental inside our universe, we have to talk about all these things that are traditionally\nconsidered emergent, but are really just structures in time that have causal histories\nthat constructed them, and you know, are really actually what our universe is about. - So we should focus on the construction methodology\nas the fundamental thing. But do you think there's a bottom to the smallest possible thing\nthat makes up the universe? - I don't see one. - And it'll take way too long. It'll take longer to find that, than it will to understand the\nmechanism that created life. - I think so, yeah. I think for me, the\nfrontier in modern physics, where the new physics lies, is not in high energy particle physics, it's not in quantum gravity, it's not in any of these\nsort of traditionally sold, \"This is gonna be the\nnewest, deepest insight we have into the nature of reality.\" It is going to be in studying\nthe problems of life, and intelligence, and the\nthings that are sort of also our current existential\ncrises as a civilization or a culture that's\ngoing through, you know, an existential trauma of\ninventing technologies that we don't understand right now. - The existential trauma, and the terror we feel\nthat that technology might somehow destroy us, us meaning living,\nintelligent living organisms- - Right.\n- And yet we don't understand what that even means. - Well, humans have always been afraid of our technologies though, right? So it's kind of a fascinating thing that every time we invent\nsomething we don't understand, it takes us a little\nwhile to catch up with it. - I think also in part, humans\nkind of love being afraid. - Yeah, we love being traumatized. - It's weird, the drama.\n- We wanna learn more, and then when we learn more\nit traumatizes us. (laughs) (Lex laughs) You know, I never thought\nabout this before, but I think this is one of\nthe reasons I love what I do is because it traumatizes\nme all the time. (laughs) That sounds really bad, but what I mean is like, I love\nthe shock of like realizing that like coming to understand something in a way that you never\nunderstood it before. I think it seems to me, when I see a lot of the ways other people react to new ideas, that they don't feel\nthat way intrinsically. But for me that's like... That's why I do what I do. I love that feeling. - But you're also working on a topic where it's fundamentally ego destroying, because you're talking about like life. It's humbling to think that we're not... The individual human is not special. - Yeah.\n- And you're like very viscerally exploring that. - Yeah, I'm trying to embody that. I think you have to live the\nphysics to understand it. But there's a great quote about Einstein, I don't know if this is true or not, that he once said that\nhe could feel light beam in his belly. And I think...\n(both chuckle) But I think like, you gotta\nthink about it though, right? Like if you're a really deep thinker, and you're really thinking\nabout reality that deeply, and you are part of the reality that you're trying to describe, like you feel it, you really feel it. - That's what I was saying about, you're always like\nwalking along the cliff, and if you fall off, you're\nfalling into madness. - Yes, it's a constant,\nconstant descent into madness. - The fascinating thing about physicists and madness is that you don't know if you've fallen off the cliff. - Yeah, I know. You don't know. - That's the cool thing about that.\n- I rely on other people to tell me. Actually this is very funny, 'cause like I have these conversations with my students often, like they're worried about\ngoing crazy, (laughs) and I have to like reassure them that like one of the\nreasons they'll stay sane is by trying to work on concrete problems. - Going crazy or waking up? I don't know which one it is.\n- Yeah. - So what do you think is\nthe origin of life on Earth, and how can we talk about\nit in a productive way? - The origin of life is like this boundary that the universe can only cross if a structure that emerges can\nreinforce its own existence, which is self reproduction,\nauto catalysis, things people traditionally talk about. But it has to be able to maintain its own existence against this sort of randomness\nthat happens in chemistry, and this randomness that\nhappens in the quantum world. And like it's in some sense, the emergence of like a\ndeterministic structure that says, you know, \"I'm gonna exist and\nI'm gonna keep going.\" But you know, pinning\nthat down is really hard. We have ways of thinking\nabout it in assembly theory that I think are pretty rigorous, and one of the things\nI'm really excited about is trying to actually quantify in an assembly theoretic way when the origin of life happens. But the basic process I have in mind is like a system that has no causal contingency,\nno constraints of objects, basically constraining the\nexistence of other objects or allowing the existence\nof other objects. And so that sounds very abstract, but like you can just think\nof like a chemical reaction can't happen if there's not\na catalyst, for example. Or a baby can't be born\nif there wasn't a parent. So there's a lot of causal contingency that's necessary for\ncertain things to happen. So you think about this sort\nof unconstrained random system, there's nothing that reinforces the existence of other things. So the sort of resources\njust get washed out in all of these different structures, and none of them exist again. Or they just, you know... They're not very complicated\nif they're in high abundance, and some random events allow some things to start reinforcing the existence of a small subset of objects. And if they can do that, you know, like just molecules basically\nrecognizing each other and being able to catalyze\ncertain reactions. There's this kind of\ntransition point that happens, where unless you get a\nself-reinforcing structure, something that can\nmaintain its own existence, it actually can't cross this boundary to make any objects in high abundance without having this sort of past history that it's carrying with us, and maintaining the existence\nof that past history, and that boundary point\nwhere objects can't exist unless they have the\nselection and history in them, is what we call the origin of life. And pretty much everything\nbeyond that boundary, is holding on for dear life\nto all of the causation and causal structure that's\nbasically put it there, and it's carving its way\nthrough this possibility space into generating more and more structure, and that's when you get the\nopen-ended cascade of evolution. But that boundary point\nis really hard to cross, and then what happens when\nyou cross that boundary point and the way objects come into existence is also like really fascinating dynamics, because you know, like as\nthings become more complex, the assembly index increases. I can explain all these things, sorry. You can tell me what you want explained. (Sara laughs) Or what people will wanna hear. Sorry, I have like a very\nvivid visual in my brain and it's really hard to articulate it. - Gotta convert it to language. - I know, it's so hard.\n(Sara laughs) It's like, it's going from like a feeling, to a visual, to language,\nis so stifling sometimes. - And then I have to convert it- - Yeah.\n- From language to a visual. - Yeah.\n- To a feeling. - Yeah.\n- I think it's working. - I hope so.\n- I really like the self-reinforcing objects. I mean, just so-\n- Yeah. - Just so I understand, one way to create a lot\nof the same kind of object is make them self reinforcing. - Yes, so self reproduction\nhas its property, right? Like if that system can make itself, then it can persist in time, right? Because all objects decay, they\nall have a finite lifetime. So if you're able to make a\ncopy of yourself before you die, before the second law eats you or whatever people think happens, then that structure can persist in time. - So that's a way to sort of\nemerge out of a random soup. Outta the randomness of soup.\n- Yes. Right, but things that can\ncopy themselves are very rare. - Yeah.\n- And so what ends up happening is that you get structures that enable the existence of other things, and then somehow, only\nfor some sets of objects, you get closed structures\nthat are self-reinforcing, and allow that entire\nstructure to persist. - Right, so the one... Object A reinforces the\nexistence of object B, but you know, object A can die. - Yeah.\n- So you have to like close that loop. - [Sara] Right, so this is the classic- - And it's just all very\nunlikely statistically, but you know, that's-\n- Right. - Sufficiently... So you're saying there's a chance. - There is a chance.\n- It's low probability but once you solve that,\nonce you close the loop, you can create a lot of those objects. - And that's what we're\ntrying to figure out, is what are the causal\nconstraints that close the loop. So there is this idea that's\nbeen in the literature for a really long time, that was originally\nproposed by Stuart Kauffman as really critical to the origin life called autocatalytic sets. So autocatalytic set is\nexactly this property. We have A makes B, B makes C, C makes A, and you get a closed system. But the problem with the\ntheory of autocatalytic sets is incredibly brittle as a theory and it requires a lot\nof ad hoc assumptions. Like you have to assume function, you have to say, \"This thing makes B,\" it's not an emergent property, the association between A and B. And so the way I think about\nit is much more general, if you think about these\nhistories that make objects, it's kind of like the structure\nof the histories becomes... Collapses in such a way that these things are all in the same sort of causal structure, and that causal structure\nactually loops back on itself to be able to generate some of the things that make the higher level structures. Lee has a beautiful example of\nthis actually in molybdenum. It's like the first\nnon-organic autocatalytic set. It's a self reproducing molybdenum ring, but it's like molybdenum and basically like if you\nlook at the molybdenum, it makes a huge molybdenum ring. I don't remember exactly how big it is, it might be like 150\nmolybdenum atoms or something. But if you think about\nthe configuration space of that object, you know,\nit's exponentially large, how many possible molecules? So like why does the\nentire system collapse on just making that one structure? If you start from like,\nyou know, molybdenum atoms that are maybe just like a\ncouple of them stuck together. And so what they see in this system is there's a few intermediate stages. So there's like some random events where the chemistry comes\ntogether, makes these structures, and then once you get\nto this very large one, it becomes a template\nfor the smaller ones, and then the whole system just reinforces its own production. - How did Lee find this molybdenum (both chuckle) closed loop. - If I knew how Lee's brain worked, I think I would understand\nmore about the universe, but I- - [Lex] This is not an algorithmic\ndiscovery, it's a like- - No, but I think it goes to\nthe deepest roots of like, when he started thinking\nabout origins of life. So I like, I mean I don't\nknow all his history, but like what he's told me is, he started out in crystallography, and you know, there's some\nthings that he would just... You know, like people\nwould just take for granted about chemical structures that he was like deeply perplexed about. Like just like why are\nthese like really intricate, really complex structures forming so easily under these conditions? And he was really interested in life, but he started in that field. So he's just carried with him these sort of deep\ninsights from these systems that seem like they're totally not alive, and just like these metallic chemistries, into actually thinking about\nthe deep principles of life. So I think he already knew a lot about that chemistry. And he also, you know... Assembly theory came from him thinking about how these systems work. So he had some intuition\nabout what was going on with this molybdenum ring. - The molybdenum might\nbe able to be the thing that makes a ring. - They knew about them for a long time, but they didn't know that the mechanism of why that particular structural form was autocatalytic feedback. And so that's what they\nfigured out in this paper. And I actually think that paper is revealing some of the mechanism of the origin of life transition, 'cause really what you see, like the origin of life is basically like, you should have a combinatorial explosion of this space of possible structures that are too large to exhaust. And yet you see it\ncollapse on this, you know, really small space of possibilities, that's mutually reinforcing\nitself to keep existing. That is the origin of life. - There's some set of structures that result in this\nautocatalytic feedback. - Yeah.\n- What is that? Some tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny percent? - I think it's a small space, but chemistry is very large, so- - And so like-\n- There might be a lot of them out there,\nbut we don't know. - And one of them is the thing that probably started life on Earth. - That's right.\n- Or many, many starts. - Yes.\n- And it keeps starting maybe. - Yeah. I mean there's also all kinds\nof other weird properties that happen around this\nkind of phase boundary. So this other project that I have in my lab is focused\non the origin of chirality, which is, you know, thinking about... So chirality is this property of molecules that they can come in mirror image forms. So like just like... Chiral literally means hand, so your left and right hand are what's called non-super imposable, because if you try to\nlay one on the other, you can't actually lay them\ndirectly on top of each other, and that's the property\nbeing a mirror image. So there's this sort\nof perplexing property of the chemistry life that no one's been able to\nreally adequately explain that all of the amino acids\nin proteins are left-handed, and all of the bases in RNA\nand DNA are right-handed. And yet the chemistry of\nthese building block units, the amino acids and nucleobases is the same for left and right-handed. So you have to have like some\nkind of symmetry breaking, where you go from these chemistries that seem entirely equivalent to only having one chemistry\ntake over as the dominant form. And for a long time, I had been really... I actually did my PhD on\nthe origin of chirality. I was working on it as like a symmetry breaking\nproblem in physics. This is how I got started\nin the origin of life, and then I left it for a long time, 'cause I thought it was like one of the most boring\nproblems in the origin of life, but I've come back it, 'cause I think there's something\nreally deep going on here related to this like\ncombinatorial explosion of the space of possibilities. But just to get to that point, like this feature of this handedness has been the main focus, but people take for granted the existence of chiral molecules at all, that this property of having a handedness. And they just assume that, you know, like it's just a generic\nfeature of chemistry. But if you actually look at molecules, if you look at chemical space, which is like the space\nof all possible molecules that people can generate, and you look at small molecules, things that have less than\nabout seven to 11 heavy atoms, so things that are not hydrogen. Almost every single molecule\nin that space is achiral, like doesn't have a chiral center. So it would be like a spoon. A spoon doesn't have a... Like it's the same as its mirror image. It's not like a hand that's\ndifferent than its mirror image. But if you get to like\nthis threshold boundary, above that boundary, almost\nevery single molecule is chiral. So you go from a universe where almost nothing\nhas a mirror image form. There's no mirror image\nuniverse of possibilities, to this one where every single structure has pretty much a mirror image version. And what we've been looking at in my lab is that it seems to be the case that the origin of life transition happens around the time when you\nstart accumulating... You push your molecules to\na large enough complexity that chiral molecules\nbecome very likely to form, and then there's a cascade\nof molecular recognition where chiral molecules\ncan recognize each other, and then you get this sort\nof autocatalytic feedback and things self-reinforcing. - So is chirality in itself\nan interesting feature or just an accident? - No, it's a super interesting feature. I think chirality breaks\nsymmetry in time not space. So we think of it as a spatial property, like a left and right hand, but if I choose the left hand, I'm basically choosing\nthe future of that system, for all time, because I've\nbasically made a choice between the ways that that\nmolecule can now react with every other object\nin its chemical universe. - Oh, I see.\n- And so you're actually... Like when you have this\nsplitting of making a molecule that now has\nanother form it could have had, by the same exact atomic composition, but now it's just a mirror image isometry, you're basically splitting\nthe universe of possibilities every time. - Yeah, in two.\n- In two, but molecules can have more\nthan one chiral center, and that's not the only\nsymmetry that they can have. So this is one of the reasons that Taxol fills 1.5 universes of space. It's all of these spatial permutations that you do on these objects that actually makes the space so huge. So the point of this\nsort of chiral transition that I'm putting out is, chirality is actually a signature of being in a complex chemical space. And the fact that we think\nit's a really generic feature of chemistry and it's really prevalent, is because most of the\nchemistry we study on Earth is a product already of life. And it also has to do with\nthis transition in assembly, this transition in possibility spaces, because I think there's\nsomething really fundamental going on at this boundary, that you don't really need to go that far into chemical space if you can... To actually see life in\nterms of this depth in time, this depth in symmetries of objects, in terms of like chiral symmetries, or this assembly structure. But getting past this boundary that's not very deep in\nthat space requires life. It's a really weird property, and it's really weird that\nso many abrupt things happen in chemistry at that same scale. - So would that be the\ngreatest invention ever made on Earth in its evolutionary history? So I really like that formulation of it. Nick Lane has a book\ncalled, \"Life Ascending,\" where he lists the 10 great\ninventions of evolution, the origin of life being first, and DNA, the hereditary material that encodes the genetic instructions for all living organisms. Then photosynthesis, the\nprocess that allows organisms to convert sunlight into chemical energy, producing oxygen as a byproduct. The complex cell, eukaryotic cells, which contain a nucleus and organelles, arose from simple bacterial cells. Sex, sexual reproduction. Movement, so just the ability to move, under which you have the predation, the predators and ability\nof living organisms- - Oh, I like that movement's\n- To find food. - In there, that's cool. - Yeah, but movement includes a lot of interesting stuff in there, like predator prey dynamic. - Right.\n- Which, not to romanticize, nature is metal. That seems like an important one. I don't know. It's such a computationally powerful thing to have a predator and prey. - Well, it's efficient for things to eat other things\nthat are already alive, 'cause they don't have\nto go all the way back to the base chemistry. - Well that, but maybe\nI just like deadlines, but it creates an urgency. You're gonna get eaten. - You gotta live. - Yeah, like the survival. It's not just the static environment you battle against, you're like- - Yeah.\n- The dangers against which you're trying\nto survive are also evolving. This is just a much faster way to explore the space of possibilities. - I actually think it's a gift\nthat we don't have much time. - Yes. Sight, the ability to see. So the increasing complexifying\nof sensory organisms. Consciousness and death. The concept of programmed cell death. These are all inventions. - Yeah.\n- Along the line. - I like invention as a word\nfor them. I think that's good. - Which are the more\ninteresting inventions to you? Origin of life? Because you kind of are not glorifying the origin of life itself. There's a process-\n- No, I think the origin of life is a continual process, that's why. I'm interested in the first transition in solving that problem, 'cause I think it's the hardest, but I think it's happening all the time. - When you look back at\nthe history of Earth, like what are you impressed happened? - I like sight as an invention, 'cause I think having sensory perception and trying to \"comprehend the world,\" to use anthropocentric terms, is like a really critical feature of life. And I also... It's interesting the way that sight has complexified over time, right? So like if you think\nat the origin of life, nothing on the planet could see, right? So like for a long\ntime, life had no sight. And then, you know, like\nphoton receptors were invented. And then when multicellularity evolved, those cells eventually grew into eyes and we had the multicellular eye. And then it's interesting,\nwhen you get to societies, like human societies, that we invent even better\ntechnologies of seeing, like telescopes and microscopes, which allow us to see\ndeeper into the universe or at smaller scales. So I think that's pretty profound, the way that sight has\ntransformed the ability of life to literally see the reality\nin which it's existing in. I think consciousness is also obviously deeply interesting. I've gotten kind of\nobsessed with like octopus. I don't like, I... They're just so weird, and the fact that like they\nevolved complex nervous systems kind of independently is\nlike, seems very alien. - Yeah, there's a lot\nof alien like organisms. That's another thing I saw in the jungle. - Yeah.\n- Just things that are like, \"Oh, okay. They make one of those, huh?\" It just feels like there's-\n- Do you have any examples? - There's a frog that's as\nthin as a sheet of paper. - Oh wow.\n- And I was like, \"What?\" And it gives birth\nthrough like pores, like- - Oh, I've seen videos of that. It's so gross when the babies come out. - Yes.\n- Did you see that? Like in person-\n- Yes. - Like the babies coming out?\n- Oh no, no. I saw the... Without the-\n- Have you seen videos of that? It's so gross. It's one of the grossest\nthings I've ever seen. (laughs) - Well, gross is just the other\nside of beautiful I think. - Yeah.\n- 'Cause it's like, \"Oh wow, that's possible.\" - I guess if I was one of those frogs, I would think that was\nthe most beautiful event I'd ever seen. Although like human childbirth\nis not that beautiful either. (Sara laughs)\n- Yeah, it's all a matter of perspective. - Well we come into\nthe world so violently, it's just like... It's amazing. - Well, I mean the world\nis a violent place. - Yeah.\n- So again, another... It's just another side of the coin. - You know what, this actually makes me think\nof one that's not up there, which I do find really incredibly amazing, is the process of like\nthe germline cell in... You know, in organisms. Like basically like every\nliving thing on this planet at some point in its life has\nto go through a single cell, and this whole issue of like development, like the developmental\nprogram is kind of crazy. Like how do you build\nyou out of a single cell? How does a single cell\nknow how to do that? Like, you know, pattern formation of a multicellular organism, obviously like evolves with DNA. But there's a lot of stuff happening there about when cells take\non certain morphologies and things that people don't understand, like the actual shape formation mechanism. And a lot of people study that and it's... And there's a lot of advances\nbeing made now in that field. I think it's pretty shocking though that like how little we\nknow about that process. And often it's left off of people's lists. It's just kind of interesting. Embryogenesis is fascinating. - Yeah, 'cause it... You start from just one cell. - Yeah, and the genes in all\nthe cells are the same, right? So like the differentiation has to be something that's like much more about like the\nactual like, you know, expression of genes over time, and like how they get switched on and off, and also the physical environment of like the cell interacting\nwith other cells, and there's just a lot of stuff going on. - Yeah, the computation, the\nintelligence of that process- - Yes.\n- Might be like the most important thing to understand, and we just kind of don't\nreally think about it. - Right.\n- We think about the final product. - Yeah.\n- Maybe the key to understanding the organism\nis understanding that process, not the final product - Probably, yes. I think most of the things about understanding anything about what we are, are embedded in time. - [Lex] Well of course you would say that. - I know, so predictable. (laughs) It's turning into a\ndeterministic universe. - It always has been. Always was, like the meme. - Yeah, always was, but\nit won't be in the future. - Well that's... Before we talk about the future, let's talk about the\npast, the assembly theory. - Yes.\n- Can you explain assembly theory to me? I listened to Lee talk\nabout it for many hours and I understood nothing. No, I'm just kidding.\n(Sara laughs) I just wanted to take another... Well, you've been\nalready talking about it, but just another-\n- Yeah. - What from a big picture view is the assembly theory way\nof thinking about our world, about our universe. - Yeah. I think the first thing is, you know, that like the observation that, life seems to be the only\nthing in the universe that builds complexity in\nthe way that we see it here, and complexity is obviously\nlike a loaded term. So I'll just use assembly instead, 'cause I think assembly is more precise. But the idea that like, you know, all the things on your desk here, from your computer, to the pen, to, you know, us sitting here, don't exist anywhere else in\nthe universe as far as we know. They only exist on this planet. And it took a long evolutionary\nhistory to get to us, is a real feature that\nwe should take seriously as one that's deeply embedded\nin the laws of physics and the structure of the\nuniverse that we live in. Standard physics would say that, you know, all of that complexity traces back to the infinitesimal deviations in like the initial state of the universe, that there was some order there. I find that deeply unsatisfactory, and what assembly theory says, that's very different, is that the universe is\nbasically constructing itself. And when you get to these\ncombinatorial spaces like chemistry, where the space of\npossibilities is too large to exhaust them all, you can only construct things along historically contingent paths. Like you basically have causal\nchains of events that happen to allow other things\nto come into existence. And that this is the way that complex objects get formed, is basically on scaffolding on\nthe past history of objects, making more complex objects, making more complex objects. That idea in itself is\neasy to state and simple, but it has some really\nradical implications as far as what you think is\nthe nature of the physics that would describe life. And so what assembly theory does formally, is try to measure the boundary in the space of all things that, you know, chemically\ncould exist, for example, like all possible molecules. Where is the boundary\nabove which we should say, \"These things are too complex to happen outside of an\nevolutionary chain of events, outside of selection.\" And we formalize that\nwith two observables, one of them is the copy\nnumber of the object. So how many of the object did you observe? And the second one is,\nwhat's the minimal number of recursive steps to make it? So if you start from\nelementary building blocks like bonds for molecules and you put them together, and then you take things\nyou've made already and built up to the object, what's the shortest number\nof steps you had to take? And what Lee's been able to\nshow in the lab with his team is that for organic chemistry,\nit's about 15 steps. And then you only see\nmolecules that, you know... Only molecules that we observe, that are past that threshold,\nare ones that are in life. And in fact, one of the\nthings I'm trying to do with this idea of like trying to actually\nquantify the origin of life as a transition in... Like a phase transition assembly theory, is actually be able to explain why that boundary is where it is, 'cause I think that's\nactually the boundary that life must cross. So the idea of going back to this thing we were talking about before about these structures that can reinforce their own existence and move past that boundary. 15 seems to be that\nboundary in chemical space. It's not a universal number. It will be different for\ndifferent assembly spaces, but that's what we've\nexperimentally validated so far, and then- - So literally 15, like\nthe assembly index is 15? - It's 15 or so for the\nexperimental data, yeah. - So that's when you start\ngetting the self-reinforcing? - That's when you have\nto have that feature in order to observe\nmolecules in high abundance in that space. - So copy number is the\nnumber of exact copies. That's what you mean by high abundance, and assembly index or the\ncomplexity of the object is how many steps it took to create it. Recursive-\n- Recursive, yeah. So you can think of objects in assembly theory as\nbasically recursive stacks of the construction steps to build them. So they're like, it's like... You take this step and then you make this object,\nand you make it this object, and make this object, and then you get up to the final object, but that object is all of that history rolled up into the current structure. - What if you took the long way home- - You can't take the long way. - Why not?\n- The long way doesn't exist. - It's a good song though. What do you mean the\nlong way doesn't exist? If I do a random walk from A to B, I'll eventually... If I start at A, I'll\neventually end up at B, and that random walk would be\nmuch longer than the short. - No, if you look at objects and you... So we define something we\ncall the assembly universe, and assembly universe is ordered in time. It's actually ordered in the causation, the number of steps to produce an object, and so all objects in the\nuniverse, are in some sense... Exist at a layer that's defined\nby their assembly index, and the size of each layer\nis growing exponentially. So what you're talking about, if you wanna look at the long\nway of getting to an object, as I'm increasing the\nassembly index of an object, I'm moving deeper and deeper into an exponentially growing space. And it's actually also the case that the sort of typical\npath to get to that object is also exponentially growing with respect to the assembly index. And so if you want to try to make a more and more complex object, and you wanna do it by a typical path, that's actually an\nexponentially receding horizon. And so most objects\nthat come into existence have to be causally very similar\nto the things that exist, 'cause they're close by in that space, and they can actually get to it by an almost shortest\npath for that object. - Yeah, the almost shortest\npath is the most likely like by a lot. - By a lot.\n- Okay. So if you see a high copy number. - Yeah, imagine yourself-\n- A copy number of greater than one. - Yeah, I mean basically we live... The more complex we get, we live in a space that is\ngrowing exponentially large, and the ways of getting to objects in the space are also\ngrowing exponentially large. And so we're this kind of recursively like stacked structure of like all of these objects that are clinging onto\neach other for existence, and then they like grab something else, and are like able to bring\nthat thing into existence, 'cause it's kind of similar to them. - But there is a phase transition. There is a- - There is a transition.\n- There is a place where you would say, \"Oh-\" - I think it's actually abrupt. I've never been able to say\nthat in my entire career before. I've always gone back and forth about whether the origin\nof life was kind of gradual or abrupt, I think it's very abrupt. - Poetically, chemically-\n- Life snaps into existence. - Oh it snaps, okay, that's very beautiful.\n- It snaps. - Okay, but-\n- We'll be poetic today. But no, I think there's like\na lot of random exploration and then there's a like... And then the possibility space just collapses on the\nstructure kind of really fast. That can reinforce its own existence, because it's basically\nfighting against non-existence. - Yeah, you tweeted, \"The\nmost significant struggle for existence in the evolutionary process is not among the objects that do exist, but between the ones that do, and those that never have the chance to. - Yeah.\n- This is where selection does most of its causal work.\" The objects that never\nget a chance to exist. - Yeah.\n- The struggle between the ones that never get a chance to\nexist and the ones that... Okay, what's that line exactly? - I don't know, we can make\nsongs out of all of these. - What are the objects that never get a chance to exist? What does that mean? - So there was this website, I forgot what it was, but it's like a neural network that just generates a human face, and it's like, \"This\nperson does not exist.\" I think that's what it's called, right? So you can just click on that all day, and you can look at people\nall day that don't exist. - Yeah.\n- All of those people exist in that space of\nthings that don't exist. - Yeah, but there's the real struggle. - Yeah, so the struggle of the quote, the struggle for existence is, you know, that goes all the way back to Darwin's writing about\nnatural selection, right? So like the whole idea of\nsurvival of the fittest is everything struggling to exist, this predator prey dynamic, and the fittest survive, and so the struggle for existence is really what selection is all about. And that's true, we do\nsee things that do exist competing to continue to exist. But each time that... Like if you think about\nthis space of possibilities and you know, each time the universe, you know, generates a new structure, or like an object that exists, generates a new structure\nalong this causal chain. It's generating something that exists, that never existed before. And each time that we make\nthat kind of decision, we're excluding a huge\nspace of possibilities. And so actually like as this process of increasing assembly index, it's not just that like the space that these objects exist in\nis exponentially growing, but there are objects in that space that are exponentially\nreceding away from us. So they're becoming exponentially less and less likely to ever exist, and so existence excludes\na huge number of things. - Just because of the accident\nof history, how it ended up. - Yeah, it is in part an accident, because I think some of the structure that gets generated is\ndriven a bit by randomness. I think a lot of it, you know, so... You know, one of the\nconceptions that we have in assembly theory is, you know, the universe\nis random at its base. You can see this in chemistry, like unconstrained chemical\nreactions are pretty random. And also quantum mechanics, you know, like there's lots of places\nthat give evidence for that. And deterministic structures emerge by things that can causally\nreinforce themselves and maintain persistence over time. And so we are some of the\nmost deterministic things in the universe. And so like we can generate\nvery regular structure, and we can generate new structure along a particular lineage. But the possibility space\nat the sort of tips, like the things we can\ngenerate next is really huge. So there's some stochasticity\nin what we actually, you know, instantiate as like the next structures that get built in the biosphere. It's not completely deterministic, 'cause the space of future possibilities is always larger than the\nspace of things that exist now. - So how many instantiations\nof life is out there, do you think? So how often does this happen? What we see happen here on Earth? How often is this process repeated throughout our galaxy,\nthroughout the universe? - So I said before, like right now, I think the origin of life is\na continuous process on Earth. Like, I think this idea of\nlike combinatorial spaces that our biosphere generates,\nnot just chemistry, but other spaces, often\ncross this threshold where they then allow themselves to persist with particular\nregular structure over time. So language is another\none where, you know, like the space of, you know,\npossible configurations of the 26 letters of the English alphabet is astronomically large, but we use with very high\nregularity, certain structures. And then we associate meaning to them because of the regularity of like how much we use them, right? So meaning is an emergent\nproperty of the causation and the objects and like\nhow often they recur, and what the relationship\nof the recurrence is to other objects. - Meaning is the emergent property. Okay, got it.\n- Well this is why you can play with\nlanguage so much actually. So words don't really carry meaning, it's just about how\nyou lace them together. - Yeah, but from where does the- - But you don't have a lot of room... Obviously, as a speaker\nof a given language, you don't have a lot of room\nwith a given word to wiggle. But you have a certain amount of room to push the meanings of words. - Yeah.\n- And I do this all the time and you have to do it with\nthe kind of work that I do. Because if you want to\ndiscover an abstraction, like some kind of concept that we don't understand yet, it means we don't have the language. And so the words that we have are inadequate to describe the things. This is why we're having a hard time talking about assembly theory, 'cause it's a newly emerging idea. And so I'm constantly playing with words in different ways to try\nto convey the meaning that is actually behind the words, but it's hard to do. - So you have to wiggle\nwithin the constraints. - Yes, lots of wiggle. - The great orators are\njust good at wiggling. - Do you wiggle? (laughs) - I'm not a very good wiggler, no. This is the problem. This\nis part of the problem. - No, I like playing with words a lot. You know, it's very funny 'cause you know, like I know you talked\nabout this with Lee, but like, people were so offended by the writing of the paper\nthat came out last fall, and it was interesting because the ways that we use words were not the way that\npeople were interacting with the words. And I think that was part of the mismatch, where we were trying to\nuse words in a new way, 'cause we were trying to describe\nsomething that, you know, hadn't been described adequately before. But we had to use the words\nthat everyone else uses for things that are related, and so it was really interesting to watch that clash play out in real time, for me, being someone that tries to be so precise with my word usage, knowing\nthat it's always gonna be vague. - Boy, can I relate. It's like, what is truth? Is truth the thing you meant\nwhen you wrote the words? Or is truth the thing\nthat people understood when they read the words? - Oh yeah.\n- I think that compression mechanism into language is a really interesting one, and that's why Twitter is a nice exercise- - I love Twitter.\n- You get to write a thing, and you think a certain\nthing when you write it, and then you get to see all\nthese other people interpret it all kinds of different ways. - I use it as an experimental\nplatform for that reason. - I wish there was a higher diversity of interpretation mechanisms\napplied to tweets. Meaning like-\n- Oh. - All kinds of different\npeople would come to it. Like some people that see\nthe good in everything and some people that are ultra cynicals. - Yeah.\n- A bunch of haters and a bunch of lovers and a bunch of- - Maybe they could do better jobs with presenting material to people. Like, you know, they ran like... How things, you know, it's\nlike usually based on interest, but I think it would be\nreally nice if you got like, 10% of your Twitter feed was random stuff sampled from other places,\nthat'd be kind of fun. - True. I also would love to\nfilter, just like bin, the response to tweets by like the people that\nhate on everything. - Yes.\n- The people that are- - Oh, that would be fantastic. - The people that are like\nsuper positive about everything, and then that'll just kind of, I guess, normalize the response. - Yeah.\n- Because then it'd be cool to see if the people that are usually\npositive about everything are hating on you, or like totally don't understand, or completely misunderstood. - Yeah, usually takes a lot\nof clicking to find that out. Yeah, so it'd be better\nif it was sorted, yeah. - The more clicking you do, the more damaging it is to the soul.\n- Yeah. It's like instead of like... Like you could have the blue check, but you should have like, are\nyou a pessimist, an optimist? - There's a lot of-\n- Chaotic neutral? (laughs) - A whole rainbow of checks. And then you realize\nthere's more categories than we can possibly express in colors. - Yeah, of course. People are complex. - That's our best feature. I don't know how we got\nto the wiggling required, given the constraints of language, because I think we started about\nme asking about alien life, which is, how many different times did the phase transition happen elsewhere? Do you think there's other\nalien civilizations out there? - This goes into like the, you know, like are you on the\nboundary of insane or not? But you know, when you\nthink about the structure of the physics of what we are that deeply, it really changes your\nconception of things. And you know, going to\nthis idea of the universe, you know, being kind of\nsmall in physical space compared to how big it is in\ntime and like how large we are. It really makes me question about whether there's any other structure that's like this giant crystal in time, this giant causal structure, like our biosphere/technosphere is, anywhere else in the universe. - Why not?\n- I don't know. - Just because this one is gigantic doesn't mean there's\nno other gigantic ones- - Right, but I think when the\nuniverse is expanding, right? It's expanding in space, but in assembly theory it's\nalso expanding in time. And actually that's driving\nthe expansion in space, and expansion in time is\nalso driving the expansion in the sort of combinatorial\nspace of things on our planet. So that's driving the sort of, you know, pace of technology and\nall the other things. So time is driving all of these things, which is a little bit crazy to think that the universe is just getting bigger because time is getting bigger. But like this sort of visual that gets built in my brain about that is like this structure that we're building on this planet is packing more and more time in this very small volume of space, right? 'Cause our planet hasn't\nchanged its physical size in 4 billion years, but there's like a ton of\ncausation and recursion and time, whatever word you wanna use, information, packed into this. And I think this is also, you know, embedded in sort of the\nvirtualization of our technologies or the abstraction of language and all of these things, these things that seem really abstract are just really deep in time. And so what that looks like is, you have a planet that becomes\nincreasingly virtualized, and so it's getting\nbigger and bigger in time, but not really expanding out in space, and the rest of space is like\nkind of moving away from it. Again, it's a sort of\nexponentially receding horizon. And I'm just not sure how far into this evolutionary\nprocess something gets, if it can ever see that there's another\nsuch structure out there. - What do you mean by\nvirtualized in that context? - Virtual as sort of a\nplay on virtual reality and like simulation theories, but virtual also in a sense of, you know, we talk about virtual\nparticles in particle physics, which, you know, they are very critical to doing calculations about\npredicting the properties of real particles, but we\ndon't observe them directly. So what I mean by virtual here is, virtual reality for me, things that appear\nvirtual, appear abstract, are just things that\nare very deep in time, in the structure of\nthe things that we are. So if you think about you as\na 4 billion year old object, the things that are a part of you, like your capacity use\nlanguage or think abstractly or have mathematics,\nare just very, you know, like deep, temporal structures. That's why they look like\nthey're informational and abstract, is because they're like... They're existing in this\ntemporal part of you, but not necessarily spatial part. - Just because I have a 4\nbillion year old history, why does that mean I can't\nhang out with aliens? - There's a couple ideas\nthat are embedded here. So one of them comes, again, from Paul, he wrote this book years\nago about, you know, like the eerie silence\nand why we're alone. And he concluded the book with\nthis idea of quintelligence or something, but like\nthis idea that like, really advanced intelligence would basically just build\nitself into a quantum computer and it would wanna operate\nin the vacuum of space, 'cause that's the best place\nto do quantum computation, and it would just like run out all of its computations indefinitely, but it would look completely dark to the rest of the universe. And I don't think.... As typical, like, I don't\nthink that's actually like the right physics, but I think something about that idea, as I do with all ideas,\nis partially correct. And Freeman Dyson also\nhad this amazing paper about how long life could persist in a universe that was\nexponentially expanding. And his conception was like, if you imagine analog life form, it could run slower and\nslower and slower and slower and slower as a function of time. And so it would be able\nto run indefinitely, even against an exponentially\nexpanding universe, because it would just\nrun exponentially slower. And so I guess part of\nwhat I'm doing in my brain is putting those two things together along with this idea\nthat we are building... You know, like if you\nimagine, with our technology, we're now building\nvirtual realities, right? Like things we actually\ncall virtual reality, which required, you know,\nfour billions years of history and a whole bunch of data to basically embed them in\na computer architecture. So now you can put like, you\nknow, an Oculus headset on and think that you're\nin this world, right? And what you really are embedded in is in a very deep temporal structure. And so it's huge in time,\nbut it's very small in space, and you can go lots of places\nin the virtual space, right? But you're still stuck in\nlike your physical body and like sitting in the chair. And so, you know, part of it is, it might be the case that\nsufficiently evolved biospheres kind of virtualize themselves, and they internalize their universe and their sort of\ntemporal causal structure, and they close themselves off\nfrom the rest of the universe. - I just don't know if a\ndeep temporal structure necessarily means that you're closed off. - No, I don't either. So that's kind of my fear. So I'm not sure I'm\nagreeing with what I say. I'm just saying like, this\nis one sort of conclusion and you know, like in\nmy most sort of like... It's interesting, 'cause I\ndon't do psychedelic drugs, but when people describe to me, like your thing with the faces and stuff, and like I have... You know, I've had a lot of\ndeep conversations with friends that have done psychedelic\ndrugs for intellectual reasons and otherwise, but I'm always like, \"Oh, it sounds like you're\njust doing theoretical physics. Like that's what brains do on\ntheoretical physics.\" (laughs) So I live in these like\nreally abstract spaces most of the time, but there's also this\nissue of extinction, right? Like extinction events\nare basically pinching off an entire, like, causal structure. One of these like... I'm gonna call them time crystals, I don't like know what... But there's like these\nvery large objects in time, pinching off that whole\nstructure from the rest of it. And so it's like, if you\nimagine that sort of same thing in the universe, you know, I once thought that sufficiently\nadvanced technologies would look like black holes. - That would be just\ncompletely imperceptible to us. - Yeah. So there might be lots\nof aliens out there. Maybe that's the explanation\nfor all the singularities, they're all pinched off causal structures that virtualized their reality and kind of broke off from us. - Black holes in every way,\nso like untouchable to us or unlikely to be detectable by us- - Right.\n- With whatever sensory mechanisms we have. - Yeah, but the other\nway I think about it is, there is probably,\nhopefully life out there. So like I do work on\nlife detection efforts in the solar system, and I'm trying to help with the\nHabitable Worlds Observatory mission planning right now, and working with like the\nbio signatures team for that. Like to think about\nexoplanet bio signatures. So like I have some optimism\nthat we might find things, but there are the challenges that we don't know the\nlikelihood for life, like, which is what you were talking about. So if I get to a more grounded discussion, what I'm really interested in doing is trying to solve the origin of life so we can understand how\nlikely life is out there. So I don't think that the... I think that the problem\nof discovering alien life and solving the origin of\nlife are deeply coupled, and in fact are one and the same problem. And that the first contact with alien life will actually be in an\norigin of life experiment, but that part I'm super interested in. And then there's this other feature that I think about a lot, which is, our own technological phase of\ndevelopment as sort of like, what is this phase in the\nevolution of life on a planet. If you think about a\nbiosphere emerging on a planet and evolving over billions of years and evolving into a technosphere, when a technosphere can move off planet and basically reproduce\nitself on another planet, now you have biospheres\nreproducing themselves, basically. They have to go through\ntechnology to do that. And so there are ways of thinking about sort of the nature of intelligent life and how it spreads in that capacity, that I'm also really excited\nabout and thinking about. And all of those things\nfor me are connected. Like we have to solve the origin of life in order for us to get off planet, because we basically have to\nstart life on another planet, and we also have to\nsolve the origin of life in order to recognize\nother alien intelligence. Like all of these things are like literally the same problem. - Right, understanding the\norigin of life here on Earth is a way to understand ourselves and to... Understanding ourselves is a prerequisite for being able to detect other\nintelligent civilizations. I, for one, take it for what\nit's worth, on ayahuasca, one of the things I did is\nzoom out, like aggressively, at like a spaceship. And it would always go\nquickly through the galaxy, and from the galaxy to this\nrepresentation of the universe. And at least for me,\nfrom that perspective, it seemed like it was full of alien life. Not just alien life, but intelligent life- - I like that.\n- And conscious life. So like, I don't know how\nto convert it into words. It's more like a feeling,\nlike you were saying. - Yeah.\n- A feeling, convert it to a visual,\nto convert it to words. So I had a visual with it, but really it was a feeling, that it was just full\nof this vibrant energy, that I was feeling when I'm looking at the people in my life- - Yeah.\n- And full of gratitude, but that same exact thing is\neverywhere in the universe. - Right.\n- So- - I totally agree with this, like that visual, I really love. And I think we live in a universe that like generates life and purpose, and like it's part of the\nstructure of just the world. And so maybe like this sort\nof lonely view I have is, I never thought about it this way until you were describing that. I was like, \"I wanna\nlive in that universe.\" And I'm like a very optimistic person and I love building visions of reality that are positive, but I think for me right now,\nin the intellectual process, I have to tunnel through this\nparticular way of thinking about the loneliness\nof being like separated in time from everything else, which I think like we also all are, because time is what\ndefines us as individuals. - So part of you is drawn to the trauma of being alone deep-\n- Yeah. - In a physics sense.\n- Yeah, but also part of what I mean is, like you have to go through ideas you don't necessarily agree with to work out what you're\ntrying to understand. And I'm trying to be inside this structure so I can really understand it. And I don't think I've\nbeen able to like... Like I'm so deeply embedded in what we are intellectually, right now, that I don't have an ability\nto see these other ones that you're describing, if they're there. - Well, one of the things\nyou kind of described that you already spoke to, you call it the great perceptual filter. - Yeah.\n- So there's the famous great filter, which is basically the idea that there's some really powerful moment in every intelligent civilization where they destroy themselves. - Yeah.\n- That explains why we have not seen aliens. And you're saying that\nthere's something like that in the temporal history of the\ncreation of complex objects, that at a certain point\nthey become an island, an island too far to reach\nbased on the perceptions. - I hope not, but yeah,\nI worry about it, yeah. - But that's basically meaning, there's something fundamental\nabout the universe, where the more complex you become, the harder it will be to\nperceive other complex- - Yeah, I mean just think about us with microbial life, right? Like we used to once be cells, and for most of human history, we didn't even recognize\ncellular life was there until we built a new\ntechnology, microscopes, that allowed us to see them, right? So it's kind of weird, right? Like things that we-\n- And they're close to us. - They're close, they're everywhere. - But also in the history\nof the development of complex objects, they're pretty close. - Yes, super close. Super close. Like yeah, I mean everything on this planet is like. (laughs) It's like pretty much the same thing. Like the space of\npossibilities is so huge, it's like we're virtually identical. - So how many flavors or kinds of life do\nyou think are possible? - I'm like trying to imagine all the little flickering\nlights in the universe. Like in the way that you were describing, that was kind of cool. - I mean, it was awesome to me. It was exactly that. It was like lights.\n- Yeah. - The way you maybe see a city, but yeah, a city from like up above, you see a city with the flickering lights, but there's a coldness to the city. - Yeah.\n- There's some... You know that, you know, humans\nare capable of good and evil and you could see like there's a complex feeling to the city. I had no such complex feeling\nabout seeing the lights of all the galaxies, whatever,\nthe billions of galaxies. - Yeah, this is kind of cool. I'll answer the question in a second, but I just maybe like... This idea of flickering lights and intelligence is\ninteresting to me, because I... You know, like we have\nsuch a human-centric view of alien intelligences, that a lot of the work that\nI've been doing with my lab is just trying to take inspiration from non-human life on Earth. And so I have this really\ntalented undergrad student that's basically building a model of alien communication based on fireflies. So one of my colleagues, Orit Peleg, she's totally brilliant, but she goes out with like GoPro cameras and like, you know,\nfilms in high resolution, all these firefly flickering. And she has like this theory about how their signaling evolved to like maximally differentiate\nthe flickering pattern. So like she has a theory\nbasically that predicts, you know, like this species should flash like this. If this one's flashing like this, this other one's gonna\ndo it at a slower rate, so that they... You know, like they can\ndistinguish each other living in the same environment. And so this undergrad's\nbuilding this model where you have like a pulsar background of all these like giant\nflashing sources in the universe and an alien intelligence, you know, wants to signal it's there, so it's flashing like a firefly. (laughs) And I just like the idea of thinking about non-human\naliens, so that was really fun. - The mechanism of the\nflashing, unfortunately is... Like the diversity of that is very high and we might not be able\nto see it, that's what- - Yeah, well I think there's some ways we might be able to\ndifferentiate that signal. I'm still thinking about this part of it. So one is, like if you have pulsars and they all have a certain spectrum to their pulsing patterns, and you have this one\nsignal that's in there, that's basically tried to\nmaximally differentiate itself from all the other\nsources in the universe. It might stick out in the distribution. Like there might be ways of actually being able to tell if it's an anomalous pulsar, basically. But I don't know if that\nwould really work or not. So, still thinking about it. - You tweeted, \"If one wants to understand how truly combinatorially and compositionally\ncomplex our universe is, they only need step into\nthe world of fashion.\" - Yeah.\n- \"It's bonkers how big the constructable\nspace of human aesthetics is.\" Can you explain? Can we explore the space\nof human aesthetics? - Yeah, I don't know. I've been kind of obsessed with the... I never know how to pronounce it. Is it Schiaparelli? Like, you know, like they\nhave ears and things. Like it's such like a\nweird, grotesque aesthetic, but like it's totally bizarre. But what I meant... Like I have a visceral experience when I walk into my closet. I have like a lot of- (laughs) - [Lex] How big is your closet? - It's pretty big. It's like, I do assembly\ntheory every morning when I walk in my closet, because I really like a very large, combinatorial, diverse palette, but I never know what I'm\ngonna build in the morning. - Do you get rid of stuff?\n- Sometimes. - Or do you have trouble\ngetting rid of stuff? Like- - I have trouble getting\nrid of some stuff. It depends on what it is. If it's vintage, it's hard to get rid of, 'cause it's kind of hard to replace. It depends on the piece, yeah. - So you have... Your closet is one of those\ntemporal time crystals that- - Yeah, it's like-\n- You get to visualize the entire history of the-\n- It's a physical manifestation of my personality. - Right. So why is that a good visualization of the combinatorial and\ncomposition and complex. - I think it's an interesting\nfeature of our species that we get to express ourself through what we wear, right? Like if you think about all those animals in the jungle you saw, like they're born the way they look, and then they're stuck with it for life. - That's true, I mean, it is one of the loudest, clearest, most consistent ways we\nsignal to each other- - Yeah.\n- It's the clothing we wear. - Yeah, and it's highly dynamic. I mean you can be dynamic if you want to. Very few people are... There's a certain bravery, but it's actually more about confidence, willing to play with style and like... And play with aesthetics. And I think it's interesting when you start experimenting with it, how it changes the fluidity\nof the social spaces and the way that you interact with them. - But there's also commitment. Like you have to wear\nthat outfit all today. - I know, I know. A big commitment. Do you feel like that\nevery morning? (laughs) - No. That's why-\n- I feel like, this is a life commitment. (laughs) - So all I have is suits and\nthe black shirt and jeans. Those are the two outfits. - Yeah. Well see this is the thing though, right? It's simplifies your thought\nprocess in the morning. So like I have other ways I do that. I park in the same exact parking spot when I go to work on the fourth\nfloor of a parking garage, because no one ever parks\non the fourth floor. So I don't have to remember\nwhere I park my car. But I really like aesthetics\nand playing with them. So I'm willing to spend part of my cognitive energy every morning trying to figure out\nwhat I wanna be that day. - Did you deliberately think about the outfit you're wearing today? - Yep.\n- Was there backup options? Or were you going back\nand forth between some- - Three or four, but I really like- - Were they drastically different? - Yes.\n- Okay.(laughs) Okay.\n- And then even this one could have been really different, because like, you know, it's not just the sort of\njacket and the shoes and like, and the hairstyle. It's like the jewelry and the accessories. So like any outfit is a\nlot of small decisions. - Well I think your current outfit is like a lot of shades of yellow. There's like a theme.\n- Yes. Yeah.\n- It's nice. I'm grateful that you did that. - Thanks.\n- It's like it's own art form. - Yeah, yellow's my\ndaughter's favorite color, and I never really\nthought about yellow much, but she's been obsessed with yellow. She's seven now and I don't\nknow, I just really love it. - I guess you can pick a color and just make that the constraint, and just go with it and understand the beauty-\n- I'm playing with yellow a lot lately. Like this is not even the most yellow, 'cause I have black pants on, but I have... I've worn outfits that have probably five\nshades of yellow in them. - Wow.\n(Sara laughs) What do you think beauty is? We seem to... So underlying this idea of\nplaying with aesthetics is, we find certain things beautiful. - Yeah.\n- What is it that humans find beautiful? And why do we need to\nfind things beautiful? - Yeah. You know, it's interesting. I mean I am attracted\nto style and aesthetics, because I think they're beautiful, but it's much more because I\nthink it's fun to play with. And so I will get to the beauty thing, but I guess I wanna just\nexplain a little bit about my motivation this space, 'cause it's really an\nintellectual thing for me. And you know, Stewart Brand\nhas this great infographic about the layers of like human society. And I think it starts with\nlike the natural sciences and like physics at the bottom, and it goes through all these layers, and it's like economics and\nthen like fashion is at the top, it's like the fastest moving\npart of human culture. And I think I really like that, because it's so dynamic and so short in it's temporal longevity, contrasted with like\nstudying the laws of physics, which are like, you know, like\nthe deep structure reality, that I feel like bridging those scales tells me much more about\nthe structure of the world that I live in. - That said, there's\ncertain kinds of fashions, like a dude in a black\nsuit with a black tie seems to be less dynamic. - Yeah.\n- It seems to persist through time. - Are you embodying this?\n- Yeah, I think so. (both laugh) I think it just-\n- I'd like to see you wear yellow, Lex. (laughs) - I wouldn't even know\nwhat to do with myself. I would freak out. I wouldn't know how to- - You wouldn't know how\nto be you, yeah, I know. This is amazing though, isn't it? Amazing, like you have\nthe choice to do it. But one of my favorite... Just on the question of beauty, one of my favorite fashion designers of all time is Alexander McQueen. And he was really phenomenal, but like his early... And actually, I kind of used\nlike what happened to him in the fashion industry\nas a coping mechanism with our paper when... Like the nature paper in the fall when everyone was saying\nit was controversial and how terrible that\nlike, you know like... But controversial is good, right? But like when Alexander McQueen,\nyou know, first came out with his fashion lines, he\nwas mixing horror and beauty, and people were horrified. It was so controversial. Like it was macabre. He had like... You know, like it looked like\nthere were blood on the models and like- - [Lex] That is beautiful. We're just looking at some pictures here. - Yeah, no, I mean his stuff is amazing. His first like runway line,\nI think, was called Nihilism. I don't know if you could find it. You know, I mean he was really dramatic. He carried a lot of trauma with him. There you go, that's... Yeah. Yeah.\n- Wow. - But he changed the fashion industry. His stuff became very popular. - That's a good outfit to\nshow up to a party. (laughs) - Right, right. But this gets at the question like, is that horrific or is it beautiful? And I think, you know,\nhe had a traumatic... He ended up committing suicide, and actually he left his death note on the descent of man. So he was a really deep person. - So I mean great fashion certainly has that kind of depth to it. - Yeah, it sure does. So I think it's the\nintellectual pursuit, right? Like it's not... So this is like very highly intellectual, and I think it's a lot like\nhow I play with language, is the same way that I play with fashion, or the same way that I play with ideas in theoretical physics. Like there's always this space that you can just push things just enough. So they look like something\nsomeone thinks is familiar but they're not familiar, and yeah, and I think that's really cool. - It seems like beauty doesn't\nhave much function, right? But it seems to also\nhave a lot of influence on the way we-\n- It has tons of function. What do you mean it doesn't have function? - I guess sexual selection\nincorporates beauty somehow. But why? Because beauty is a sign\nof health or something? I don't even- - Oh, evolutionarily? Maybe. But then beauty becomes a\nsignal of other things, right? So it's really not like... And then beauty becomes an adaptive trait, so it can change with different... Like, you know, maybe\nsome species would think, well you thought the frog having babies come out\nof its back was beautiful and I thought it was grotesque. Like there's not a universal\ndefinition of what's beautiful. It is something that is\ndependent on your history and how you interact with the world. And I guess what I like about beauty, like any other concept, is\nwhen you turn it on its head. So, you know, maybe the traditional\nconception of, you know, why women wear makeup and\nthey dress certain ways is because they wanna look beautiful and, you know, pleasing to people. And I just like to do it\n'cause it's a confidence thing. It's about embodying the\nperson that I want to be and about owning that person, and then the way that people\ninteract with that person is very different than\nif I didn't have the... Like, if I wasn't using\nthat attribute as part of... And obviously, that's influenced\nby the society I live, and like what's aesthetically\npleasing things. But it's interesting to be\nable to turn that around and not have it necessarily\nbe about the aesthetics, but about the power dynamics\nthat the aesthetics create. - But you're saying there's\nsome function to beauty, in that way. In the way you're describing, and the dynamic it creates\nin the social interaction. - Well the point is, you're saying it's an adaptive trait for like sexual selection or something. And I'm saying that the adaptation that beauty confers is\nfar richer than that. And some of the adaptation\nis about social hierarchy and social mobility and\njust plain social dynamics. Like why do some people dress goth? It's 'cause they identify with a community and a culture associated with that, and they get, you know... And that's a beautiful aesthetic. It's a different aesthetic,\nsome people don't like it. - So it has the same\nrichness as does language. - Yes.\n- It's the same kind of- - Yes, and I think too\nfew people think about the way that they... The aesthetics they build\nfor themselves in the morning and how they carry it in the world, and the way that other\npeople interact with that, because they put clothes on, and they don't think about\nclothes as carrying function. - Let's jump from beauty to language. There's so many ways to\nexplore the topic of language. You called it... You said that language is parts of language or language in itself, and the mechanism of language\nis a kind of living life form. You've tweeted a lot about this\nin all kinds of poetic ways. Let's talk about the\ncomputation aspect of it. You tweeted, \"The world\nis not a computation, but computation is our\nbest current language for understanding the world. It is important we recognize this so we can start to see the\nstructure of our future languages that will allow us to see deeper than computation allows us.\" So what's the use of language in helping us understand\nand make sense of the world? - I think one thing that I feel like I notice much more viscerally than I feel like I hear\nother people describe is that the representations in our mind and the way that we use language are not the things like... Actually, I mean, this\nis an important point, going back to what Godel did, but also this idea of signs and symbols and all kinds of ways of separating them. There's like the word, right? And then there's like what the\nword means about the world. And we often confuse those things. And what I feel very viscerally, I almost sometimes think I have some kind of like\nsynesthesia for language or something, and I just\nlike don't interact with it like the way that other people do. But for me, words are objects, and the objects are not the\nthings that they describe, they have like a different\nontology to them. Like they're physical things, and they carry causation\nand they can create meaning, but they're not what we think they are. And also like the internal\nrepresentations in our mind, like the things I'm seeing about this room are probably, you know, like\nthey're small projection of the things that are\nactually in this room. And I think we have such a difficult time moving past the way that\nwe build representations in the mind, and the way that we\nstructure our language, to realize that those are approximations to what's out there, and they're fluid, and we\ncan play around with them, and we can see deeper\nstructure underneath them, that I think, like, we're missing a lot. - Yeah, but also the life\nof the mind is in some ways richer than the physical reality. - Sure.\n- What's going on in your mind, it might be a projection- - Right.\n- Actually here, but there's also all kinds of\nother stuff going on there. - Yeah, for sure. I love this essay by Poincare about like mathematical creativity, where he talks about this\nsort of like frothing of all these things, and then like somehow you\nbuild theorems on top of it, and they become kind of concrete. But like, and I also think\nabout this with language, it's like there's a lot of\nstuff happening in your mind, but you have to compress it\nin this few sets of words to try to convey it to someone. So it's a compactification of the space, and it's not a very efficient one. And I think just recognizing that there's a lot that's\nhappening behind language is really important. I think this is one of the great things about the existential trauma\nof large language models, I think is the recognition that language is not\nthe only thing required. Like there's something underneath it. Not by everybody. - Can you just speak to the feeling you have when\nyou think about words? So is there... Like what's the magic of words to you? Is it like... It almost sometimes feels like\nyou're playing with it? Like- - [Sara] Yeah, I was just gonna\nsay it's like a playground. - But you're almost like... I think one of the things you enjoy, maybe I'm projecting, is deviating, like using words in ways\nthat not everyone uses them. Like slightly sort of deviating\nfrom the norm a little bit. - I love doing that in everything I do, but especially with language. - But not so far that\nit doesn't make sense. - Exactly.\n- So you're always like tethered to reality, to the norm, but like are playing with it, like basically fucking with\npeople's minds a little bit. I mean like, you know, and in so doing, creating a different perspective on another thing that's\nbeen previous explored in a different way. - Yeah, it's literally\nmy favorite thing to do. - Yeah. Use words as one way to make people think. - Yeah, so I, you know... A lot of my sort of like, what happens in my mind when\nI'm thinking about ideas is I've been presented\nwith this information about how people think about things, and I try to go around\nto different communities and hear the ways that different... Whether it's like, you know, hanging out with a bunch of artists or philosophers or scientists, thinking about things, like they all think\nabout it different ways, and then I just try to figure out like, how do you take the structure of the way that we're talking about it and turn it slightly, so you have all the same pieces that everybody sees are there, but the description\nthat you've come up with seems totally different. So they can understand that there's... Like they understand the\npattern you're describing, but they never heard the\nstructure underlying it described the way that you describe it. - Is there words or terms you remember that disturbed people the most? Maybe the positive sense of disturbed. Assembly theory, I suppose, is one. - Yeah, I mean the first couple sentences of that paper disturbed people a lot, and I think they were\nreally carefully constructed in exactly this kind of way. - What was that? Let me look it up. - Oh, it was really fun. But I think it's\ninteresting, 'cause I do... You know, sometimes I'm\nvery upfront about it. I say I'm gonna use the same word in probably six different\nways in a lecture, and I will. - You write, \"Scientists have grappled with reconciling biological evolution with immutable laws of the\nuniverse defined by physics. These laws underpin life's origin, evolution and the-\" (Sara faintly speaking) - [Sara] When he was here too. (laughs) - \"The development of human culture.\" Well he was... I think your for words\nruns deeper than Lee's. - Yeah, for sure. I mean this is part of the sort of brilliant thing about\nour collaboration is, you know, complimentary skillsets. So I love playing with the\nabstract space of language, and it's a really interesting playground when I'm working with Lee, because he thinks at a much deeper level of abstraction than can\nbe expressed by language. And the ideas we work on are hard to talk about for that reason. - What do you think about\ncomputation as a language? - I think it's a very poor language. A lot of people think\nis a really great one, but I think it has some nice properties, but I think the feature of it\nthat you know is compelling is this kind of idea of universality, that like you can... If you have a language, you can describe things\nin any other language. - Well, for me, one of the people who kind of revealed the\nexpressive power of computation, aside from Alan Turing, is Stephen Wolfram, through\nall the explorations of like cellular automata type of objects that he did in a new kind\nof science and afterwards. So what did he get from that? Like the kind of computational worlds that are revealed through even something as simple\nas cellular automata. Like, it seems like\nthat's a really nice way to explore languages that are far outside our human languages, and do so rigorously, and understand how those\nkinds of complex systems can interact with each other, can emerge, all that kind of stuff. - I don't think that they're\noutside our human languages. I think they define the boundary of the space of human languages. They allow us to explore\nthings within that space, which is also fantastic. But I think there is a\nset of ideas that takes... And Stephen Wolfram has\nworked on this quite a lot and contributed very significantly to it. And you know, I really\nlike some of the stuff that Stephen's doing with\nlike his physics project, but don't agree with a lot\nof the foundations of it. But I think the space is\nreally fun that he's exploring. You know, there's this assumption that computation is at\nthe base of reality, and I kind of see it at the top\nof reality, not at the base, because I think computation\nwas built by our biosphere. It's something that happened after many billion years of evolution, and it doesn't happen in\nevery physical object. It only happens in some of them. And I think one of the reasons that we feel like the\nuniverse is computational is because it's so easy for us as things that have the theory\nof computation in our minds, and actually in some sense, it might be related to the\nfunctioning of our minds and how we build languages\nto describe the world and sets of relations\nto describe the world. But it's easy for us to\ngo out into the world and build computers, and then we mistake\nour ability to do that, with assuming that the\nworld is computational. And I'll give you a really simple example. This one came from John Conway. I, one time had a conversation with him, which was really delightful. He was really fun. But he was pointing out that if you, you know, string lights\nin a barn, you know, you can program them to have your favorite one dimensional CA, and you might even be able\nto make them, you know, do a like... Be capable of universal computation. Is universal computation a\nfeature of the string lights? - Well, no.\n- No, it's probably not. It's a feature of the fact\nthat you as a programmer had a theory that you could embed in the physical architecture\nof the string lights. Now what happens though is we get confused by\nthis kind of distinction between us as agents in the world that actually can transfer things that life does onto other\nphysical substrates, with what the world is. And so for example, you'll\nsee people, you know, studying the mathematics of\nchemical reaction networks and saying, \"Well, chemistry\nis turning universal,\" or studying the laws of physics and saying, \"The laws of\nphysics are turning universal.\" But anytime that you wanna do that, you always have to\nprepare an initial state. You have to, you know... You have to constrain the rule space, and then you have to actually be able to demonstrate the\nproperties of computation. And all of that requires an agent or a designer to be able to do that. - But it gives you an\nintuition if you look at a 1D or 2D cellular automata, it allows you to build an intuition of how you can have complexity emerge from very simple beginnings, very simple initial conditions. - I think that's the intuition that people have derived from it. The intuition I get from cellular automata is that the flat space\nof an initial condition in a fixed dynamical law is not rich enough to describe an open-ended generation process. And so the way I see cellular automata, is they're embedded slices in a much larger causal structure. And if you wanna look\nat a deterministic slice of that causal structure,\nyou might be able to extract a set of consistent rules that you might call a cellular automata, but you could embed them\nas much larger space, that's not dynamical and is\nabout the causal structure and relations between all\nof those computations, and that would be the space\ncellular automata live in. And I think that's the space\nthat Stephen is talking about, when he talks about his Ruliad and these hypergraphs of all\nthese possible computations. But I wouldn't take\nthat as my base reality, because I think again, computation itself, this abstract property, computation, is not at the base of reality. - Look, can we just linger\non that Ruliad, this- - [Sara] Yeah, one Ruliad\nadd to rule them all. - Yeah, so what... This is part of Wolfram- - Yeah.\n- Physics project. It's what he calls the\nentangled limit of everything that is computationally possible. - Yeah.\n- So what's your problem with the Ruliad? - Well, it's interesting. So Stephen came to a workshop\nwe had in the Beyond Center in the fall, and the workshop theme was, \"Mathematics: Is It Evolved or Eternal.\" And he gave a talk about the Ruliad, and he was talking about how,\nyou know, a lot of the things that we talk about in the Beyond Center, like does reality have a bottom? You know, if it has a bottom, what is it? You know, like what's the- - I need to go to-\n- We'll have you to one sometime. - This is great. Does reality have a bottom? - Yeah, so we had one that was... It was called infinite\nturtles are ground truth. And it was really just about this issue. But the thing that was interesting, I think Stephen was trying\nto make the argument that, you know, fundamental\nparticles aren't fundamental, gravitation is not fundamental. You know, these are just turtles, and computation is fundamental. And I just, I remember\npointing out to him, I was like, \"Well,\ncomputation is your turtle.\" And I think it's a weird turtle to have. - First of all, isn't it\nokay to have a turtle? - It's totally fine to have a turtle. Everyone has a turtle. You can't build a theory without a turtle. - Yep.\n- It's just... So it depends on the\nproblem you wanna describe. And actually, the reason\nI can't get behind Stephen's ontology is I don't know what question\nhe's trying to answer. And without a question to answer, I don't understand why you're\nbuilding a theory of reality. - And the question you're\ntrying to answer is- - What life is.\n- What life is, which another simpler way of phrasing that is how did life originate? - Well, I started working\non the origin of life, and I think what my challenge was there, was no one knew what life was. And so you can't really\ntalk about the origination of something if you don't know what it is. And so the way I would approach it is, if you wanna understand what life is, then proving that physics is\nsolving the origin of life. So there's the theory of what life is, but there's the actual demonstration that that theory is an\naccurate description of the phenomena you aim to describe. So again, they're the same problem. It's not like I can\ndecouple origin of life from what life is. It's like that is the problem. And the point I guess I'm making about having a question is, no matter what slice of reality you take, what regularity of nature\nyou're gonna try to describe, there will be an abstraction that unifies that structure of reality, hopefully. And that will have a\nfundamental layer to it, right? 'Cause you have to explain something in terms of something else. So if I wanna explain life for example, then my fundamental description of nature has to be something I think that has to do with time being fundamental. But if I wanted to describe, I don't know, the sort of interactions of\nmatter and light, you know, I have elementary\nparticles be fundamental. If I wanna describe electricity and magnetism in the 1800s, I have to have waves\nbe fundamental, right? So like you... Or in quantum mechanics, like it's a wave function\nthat's fundamental, 'cause that's the sort\nof explanatory paradigm of your theory. So I guess I don't know\nwhat problem saying, \"Computation is fundamental\" solves. - Doesn't he want to understand how does the basic quantum mechanics and general relativity emerge? - Yeah, but that-\n- And cause time- - Right, so I think-\n- Then that doesn't really answer an important question for us? - Well, I think that the issue is, general relativity and quantum\nmechanics are expressed in mathematical languages, and then computation is\na mathematical language. So you're basically saying that maybe there's a more\nuniversal mathematical language for describing theories of\nphysics that we already know. That's an important question, and I do think that's\nwhat Steven's trying to do and do well. But then the question becomes, does that formulation of\na more universal language for describing the laws of\nphysics that we know now tell us anything new about\nthe nature of reality? Or is it a language? - And to you, languages are fundamental... It can't be fundamental. - The language itself is\nnever the fundamental thing. It's whatever it's describing. - So one of the possible\ntitles you were thinking about originally for the book is\n\"The Hard Problem of Life,\" sort of reminiscent of the\nhard problem of consciousness. So you are saying that assembly theory is supposed to be answering the\nquestion about what is life. So let's go to the other hard problems. You also say that's the\neasiest of the hard problems, is the hard problem of life. So what do you think is\nthe nature of intelligence and consciousness? You think something like assembly theory can help us understand that? - I think if assembly theory is an accurate depiction\nof the physics of life, it should shed a lot of\nlight on those problems. And in fact, I sometimes wonder if the problems of consciousness and intelligence are at all different than the problem of life generally. And I'm of two minds of it, but I in general try to... You know, like the process of my thinking is trying to regularize\neverything into one theory. So pretty much every\ninteraction I have is like, \"Oh, how do I fold that into...\" And like, so I'm just building\nthis giant abstraction, that's basically trying to\ntake every piece of data I've ever gotten in my brain into a theory of what life is. And consciousness and intelligence are obviously some of the\nmost interesting things that life has manifest. And so I think they're very telling about some of the deeper features\nabout the nature of life. - It does seem like they're\nall flavors of the same thing. But it's interesting to\nwonder like at which stage does something that we\nwould recognize as life, in a sort of canonical, silly human way, and something that we would\nrecognize as intelligence. At which stage does that emerge? Like at which assembly\nindex does that emerge? And at which assembly\nindex is a consciousness something that we would\ncanonically recognize as consciousness? - Is this the use... Like this use of flavors, the same as you meant when you were talking\nabout flavors of alien... Like alien life. - Yeah, sure. Yeah. I mean it's same as the\nflavors of ice cream and the flavors of fashion. - Yeah, like, but we were\ntalking about in terms of colors and like very nondescript. But the way that you just\ntalked about flavors now is more in like the space of\nconsciousness and intelligence. It was kind of like much more specific. - It'd be nice if there's\na formal way of expressing- - Quantifying flavors?\n- Quantifying flavors. - Yeah.\n- It seems like, I would order it life,\nconsciousness, intelligence probably. As like the order in which things emerge, and they're all just the same- - They're the same thing.\n- We're using the word life differently here. I mean life sort of, when I'm talking about, what is a living versus a non-living thing at a bar with a person, I'm already like four or five\ndrinks in, that kind of thing. - Just that. (laughs)\n- Like we're not being too philosophical. Like here's the thing that moves, and here's the thing that doesn't move. But maybe consciousness precedes that. It's a weird dance there with like... Is life proceed consciousness or consciousness proceed life. And I think that\nunderstanding of what life is in the way you're doing, will help us disentangle that - Depending on what you wanna explain. As I was saying before, you have to assume\nsomething's fundamental. And so because people can't\nexplain consciousness, there's a temptation for some people to wanna take consciousness\nas fundamental, and assume everything else\nis derived out of that. And then you get some people that wanna assume\nconsciousness preceded life. And I don't find either of those views particularly illuminating, I think... 'Cause I don't wanna assume a feminology before I explain a thing. And so what I've tried really hard to do is not assume, that I\nthink life is anything, except hold on to sort of the patterns and structures that seem to\nbe the sort of consistent ways that we talk about this thing, and then try to build a\nphysics that describes that. And I think that's a really\ndifferent approach than saying, you know, \"Consciousness is this thing, you know, we all feel and\nexperience about things.\" I would wanna understand the regularities associated with that, and build a deeper\nstructure underneath that, and build into it. I wouldn't wanna assume that thing and that I understand that thing, which is usually how I\nsee people talk about it. - The difference between\nlife and consciousness. - Yeah.\n- Which comes first. - Yeah, so I think if\nyou're thinking about this sort of thinking about living things as these giant causal structures, or these objects that are deep in time, or whatever language we end\nup using to describe it, it seems to me that\nconsciousness is about... The fact that we have\na conscious experience is because we are these\ntemporally extended objects. So consciousness and the abstraction that we have in our minds is actually a manifestation\nof all the time that's rolled up in us, and it's just because we're so huge, that we have this very large inner space that we're experiencing, that's not... And it's also separated off\nfrom the rest of the world because we're the separate thread in time. And so our consciousness\nis not exactly shared with anything else, because nothing else occupies\nthe same part of time that we occupy. But I can understand something about you maybe being conscious because you and I didn't\nseparate that far in the past, in terms of our causal histories. So in some sense we can\neven share experiences with each other through language, because of that sort of\noverlap in our structure. - Well then if consciousness is merely temporal separateness, then that comes before life. - It's not merely temporal separateness, it's about the depth in that time. So it's-\n- Yes. - The reason that my conscious experience is not the same as yours is\nbecause we're separated in time. The fact that I have\na conscious experience is because I'm an object\nthat's super deep in time, so I'm huge in time, and that means that there's a lot there that I am basically in some\nsense, a universe onto myself, because my structure is so large relative to the amount\nof space that I occupy. - But it feels like that's possible to do before you get anything like bacteria. - I think there's a horizon, and I don't know how\nto articulate this yet, it's a little bit like the\nhorizon at the origin of life, where the space inside\na particular structure becomes so large that it has some access to a space that doesn't feel as physical. It's almost like this\nidea of counterfactuals. So I think like the past\nhistory of your horizon is just much larger\nthan can be encompassed in like a small configuration of matter. So you can like pull this\nstuff into existence. This property is maybe\na continuous property, but there's something really different about human level physical systems, and human level ability\nto understand reality. I really love David Deutsch's conception of universal explainers, and that's related to the\ntheory of universal computation. And I think there's some\ntransition that happens there. But maybe to describe\nthat a little bit better, what I can also say is like, what intelligence is in this framework? So you have these objects that are, you know, large in time. They were selected to exist by constraining the\npossible space of objects to this particular... Like all of the matter is funneled into this particular\nconfiguration of object over time, and so these objects\narise through selection, but the more selection that\nyou have embedded in you, the more possible selection\nyou have on your future. And so selection and evolution, we usually think about in the past sense, where selection happened in the past, but objects that are high\ndensity configurations of matter that have a lot of selection in them are also selecting agents in the universe. So they actually embody\nthe physics of selection, and they can select on possible futures. And I guess what I'm saying\nwith respect to consciousness and the experience we have, is that there's something\nvery deep about that structure and the nature of how we\nexist in that structure that has to do with how\nwe're navigating that space, and how we generate that space, and how we continue to\npersist in that space. - Is there shortcuts we can take to artificially engineering\nliving organisms? Artificial life, artificial consciousness, artificial intelligence. So maybe just looking pragmatically at the LLMs we have now, do you think those can\nexhibit qualities of life, qualities of consciousness, qualities of intelligence in the way we think of intelligence? - I mean I think they already do, but not in the way I\nhear popularly discussed. So they're obviously\nsignatures of intelligence and a part of a ecosystem\nof intelligence systems. But I don't know that\nindividually, you know, I would assign all the properties\nto them that people have. It's a little like, so, you know, we talked about the\nhistory of eyes before, and like how eyes scaled up\ninto technological forms, and language has also had a\nreally interesting history, and got much more interesting, I think, once we started writing it down, and then, you know, in\ninventing books and things. But like, you know, every\ntime that we started storing language in a new way, you know, where we're kind of\nexistentially traumatized by it. So like, you know, the idea of written\nlanguage was traumatic, because it seemed like the\ndead were speaking to us even though they were deceased, and books were traumatic because, you know, like suddenly\nthere were lots of copies of this information available to everyone and it was gonna somehow dilute it. And large language models\nare kind of interesting, because they don't feel as static. They're very dynamic. But if you think about language in the way I was describing it before as, language is this very\nlarge in time structure, and before it had been\nsomething that was distributed over human brains as a dynamic structure, and occasionally we\nstore components of that very large dynamic structure in books or in written language. Now we can actually store the dynamics of that structure in a physical artifact, which is a large language model. And so I think about it almost like the evolution\nof genomes in some sense, where, you know, there might've been like really primitive genes on\nthe first living things, and they didn't store\na lot of information, or they were like really messy. And then we, you know, like by the time you get\nto the eukaryotic cell, you have this really\ndynamic genetic architecture that's read writeable, right? And has all of these different properties. And I think large language models are kind of like the\ngenetic system for language in some sense, where it's allowing a sort of archiving that's highly dynamic. And I think it's very paradoxical to us, because obviously in human history, we haven't been used to\nconversing with anything that's not human. But now we can converse basically with a crystallization\nof human language in a computer, that's a\nhighly dynamic crystal, because it's a crystallization in time of this massive abstract structure that's evolved over human history, and is now put into a small device. - I think crystallization kind of implies a limit on its capabilities. - I think there's not a... I mean it very purposefully, because a particular\ninstantiation of a language model trained on a particular data set becomes a crystal of the\nlanguage at that time it was trained, but obviously we're\niterating with the technology and evolving it. - I guess the question is, when you crystallize it,\nwhen you compress it, when you archive it, you're archiving some slice of the collective intelligence\n- Yes. of the human species.\n- That's right. - And the question is,\nlike how powerful is that? - Right? It's a societal\nlevel technology, right? We've actually put collective\nintelligence in a box. - Yeah, I mean, how much smarter is the\ncollective intelligence of humans versus a single human? And that's the question of AGI versus human level intelligence. Super human level intelligence versus human level intelligence. Like how much smarter can this thing... When done well, when we solve a lot of the\ncomputation complexities, maybe there's some data complexities, and how to really archive this thing, crystallize this thing really well. - Yeah.\n- How powerful is this thing gonna be? Like what's your thought? - I actually... I don't like the sort of\nlanguage we use around that, and I think the language really matters. So I don't know how to talk about how much smarter one human\nis than another, right? Like usually we talk about abilities or particular talent someone has. And you know, going back to,\nyou know, David Deutsch's idea of universal explainers, it like... You know, adopting the\nview that, you know, we're the first, you know, kinds of structures\nour biosphere has built that can understand the rest of reality. We have this universal\ncomprehension capability. You know, he makes an argument that basically, we're the first things that actually are capable\nof understanding anything. It doesn't mean an individual\nunderstands everything, but like we have that capability. And so there's not a\ndifference between that and what people talk about with AGI. In some sense, AGI is\na universal explainer, but you know, like it\nmight be that a computer is much more efficient at doing, you know, I don't know, prime\nfactorization or something, than a human is, but it doesn't mean that\nit's necessarily smarter or has a broader reach\nof the kind of things that it can understand, than a human does. And so I think we really\nhave to think about, is it a level shift? Or is it, we're enhancing certain kinds\nof capabilities humans have in the same way that we enhanced eyesight by making telescopes and microscopes. Are we enhancing capabilities\nwe have into technologies, and the entire global ecosystem\nis getting more intelligent? Or is it really that we're building some super machine in a box that's gonna be smart and kill everybody? That sounds like a science... It's not even a science fiction narrative, it's a bad science fiction narrative. I just don't think it's actually accurate to any of the technologies we're building, or the way that we should\nbe describing them. It's not even how we should\nbe describing ourselves. - So the benevolence stories,\nthere's a benevolence system that's able to transform our economy, our way of life by just, you\nknow, 10X-ing the GDP of- - Well, these are human questions, right? I don't think they're\nnecessarily questions that we're gonna like outsource to an artificial intelligence. I think what is happening and will continue to happen, is there's a co-evolution between humans and technology that's happening. And we're coexisting in\nthis ecosystem right now, and we're maintaining\na lot of the balance, and for the balance to\nshift to the technology would require some very bad human actors, which is a real risk. Or some sort of... I don't know, some sort\nof dynamic that favors... Like I just don't know how that plays out without human agency actually trying to put\nit in that direction. - It could also be how rapid the rate- - The rapid rate is scary. So like, I think the\nthings that are, you know, terrifying are, you know,\nthe ideas of deep fakes or you know, like, you know, all the kinds of issues\nthat become legal issues about artificial\nintelligence technologies. And using them to control weapons or using them for, you know, like child pornography\nor you know, like the... Or like, you know, faking\nout that someone's, you know, loved one was kidnapped or\nkilled and it, you know... Like, there's all kinds of things that are super scary in this landscape. And all kinds of new\nlegislation needs to be built, and all kinds of guardrails\non the technology to make sure that people don't\nabuse it need to be built, and that needs to happen. And I think one function of sort of the artificial\nintelligence doomsday, sort of, part of our culture right now, is it's sort of our immune\nresponse to knowing that's coming and we're over scaring ourselves, so we try to act more\nquickly, which is good. But I just, you know, it's\nabout the words that we use versus the actual things\nhappening behind the words. I think one thing that's good is when people are talking\nabout things different ways, it makes us think about them. And also when things are\nexistentially threatening, we wanna pay attention to those. But the ways that they're\nexistentially threatening, and the ways that we're\nexperiencing existential trauma, I don't think that we're\nreally gonna understand for another century or two, if ever. And I certainly think they're not the way that we're describing them now. - Well, creating existential trauma is one of the things that\nmakes life fun, I guess. - Yeah, it's just what we\ndo to ourselves. (laughs) - It gives us really exciting,\nbig problems to solve. - Yeah, for sure.\n- Do you think we'll see these AI systems become conscious, or convince us that they're conscious, and then maybe we'll have\nrelationships with them? Romantic relationships? - Well, I think people are gonna have romantic relationships with them, and I also think that some people would be convinced already that they're conscious. But I think in order... You know, what does it\ntake to convince people that something is conscious? I think that we actually\nhave to have an idea of what we're talking about, that we have to have a theory that explains when things\nare conscious or not, that's testable, right? And we don't have one right now. So I think until we have that, it's always gonna be\nthis sort of gray area, where some people think it hasn't, and some people think it doesn't, because we don't actually know what we're talking about\nthat we think it has. - So do you think it's possible\nto get out of the gray area and really have a formal\ntest for consciousness? - For sure.\n- And for life, as you were- - For sure.\n- As we've been talking about for assembly theory? - [Sara] Yeah. - Consciousness is a tricky one. - It is a tricky one. I mean, that's why it's\ncalled the hard problem of consciousness, because it's hard. And you know, it might even be outside of the purview of science, which means that we can't understand it in a scientific way. There might be other ways\nof coming to understand it, but those may not be the ones that we necessarily want\nfor technological utility, or for developing laws with respect to, because the laws are, you know, the things that are gonna\ngovern the technology. - Well I think that's actually where the hard problem of consciousness, a different hard problem\nof consciousness is that, I fear that humans will resist. That's the last thing they will resist, is calling something else conscious. - Oh, that's interesting. I think it depends on the culture though, because I mean, some\ncultures already think like everything's imbued with,\nyou know, a life essence or a kind of conscious. - I don't think those\ncultures have nuclear weapons. - No, they don't, and they're probably not building the most advanced technologies. - The cultures that are primed for destroying the other, constructing a very\neffective propaganda machine of what the other is, the group to hate, are the cultures that I worry would- - Yeah, I know.\n- Would be very resistant to label something, and to sort of acknowledge\nthe consciousness laden in a thing that\nwas created by us humans. - And so what do you\nthink the risks are there? That the conscious things\nwill get angry with us and fight back? - No, that we would torture and kill conscious beings. - Oh yeah. I think we do that quite\na lot anyway, without... I mean it goes back to your... And I don't know how to feel about this, but you know, like we talked already about the predator prey thing that like, in some sense, you know, being alive requires eating\nother things that are alive. And even if you're a vegetarian or you know, like try to have like... Like you're still eating\nliving things, yeah. - So maybe part of the story of Earth will involve a predator\nprey dynamic between humans- - That struggle for existence.\n- And human creations. - Yeah.\n- And all of that is part of the technosphere.\n- But I don't like thinking about them as like, our technologies as a separate species. 'Cause this again goes\nback to this sort of levels of selection issue. And you know, if you think\nabout humans individually alive, you miss the fact that\nsocieties are also alive. And so I think about it\nmuch more in the sense of... An ecosystem's not the right word, but we don't have the right words for these things of like... And this is why I talk\nabout the technosphere, it's a system that is both\nhuman and technological. It's not human or technological. And so this is the part that\nI think we are really good for the like... And this is driving in part a lot of the sort of attitude of like, \"I'll kill you first\nwith my nuclear weapons.\" We're really good at\nidentifying things as other, we're not really good at\nunderstanding when we're the same, or when we're part of an integrated system that's actually functioning together in some kind of cohesive way. So even if you look at like, you know, the division in American politics\nor something, for example, it's important that there's multiple sides that are arguing with each other, because that's actually how\nyou resolve society's issues. It's not like a bad feature. I think like some of the\nsort of extreme positions and like the way people talk\nabout it are maybe not ideal, but that's how societies solve problems. What it looks like for an individual is really different than\nthe societal level outcomes. And the fact that like, there is... I don't wanna call it\ncognition or computation, I don't know what you call it, but like there is a process playing out in the dynamics of societies, that we are all individual actors in, and like, we're not part of that. You know, like it requires\nall of us acting individually, but like this higher level structure is playing out some things, and like things are getting solved for it to be able to maintain itself. And that's the level that\nour technologies live at. They don't live at our level, they live at the societal level, and they're deeply integrated\nwith the social organism, if you wanna call it that. And so I really get upset\nwhen people talk about the species of artificial intelligence. I'm like, \"You mean we\nlive in an ecosystem of all these kind of intelligent things and these animating technologies\nthat we're, you know, in some sense helping to come alive. We are generating them, but it's not like the biosphere eliminated all of its past history when it invented a new species.\" All of these things get scaffolded, and we're also augmenting ourselves at the same time that we're\nbuilding technologies. I don't think we can anticipate what that system's gonna look like. - So in some fundamental way, you always want to be\nthinking about the planet as one organism. - The planet is one living thing. - What happens when it\nbecomes multi-planetary? Is it still just the- - Still the same causal chain.\n- Same causal chain. - It's like when the\nfirst cell split into two. That's what I was talking about. When a planet reproduces itself, the technosphere emerges\nenough understanding. It's like this recursive... Like the entire history of\nlife is just recursion, right? So you have an original life event. It evolves for 4 billion\nyears, at least on our planet. It evolves the technosphere, the technologies themselves\nstart to become... Having this property we call life, which is the phase we're undergoing now. It solves the origin of itself, and then it figures out\nhow that process all works, understands how to make more life, and then can copy itself\nonto another planet. So the whole structure\ncan reproduce itself. And so the origin of life\nis happening again right now on this planet in the technosphere, with the way that our planet is undergoing another transition. Just like at the origin of life when geochemistry can\ntransition to biology, which is the global... For me, it was a planetary\nscale transition. It was a multi-scale thing, that happened from the scale of chemistry, all the way to planetary cycles. It's happening now, all the way from individual\nhumans to the internet, which is a global technology, and all the other things. Like there's this multi-scale\nprocess that's happening and transitioning us globally. And it is really like\na dramatic transition. It's happening really fast. - And you think-\n- And we're living in it. - You think this\ntechnosphere that we created, this increasingly complex technosphere will spread to other planets. It'll just be-\n- I hope so. I think so - You think we'll become a type\ntwo Kardashev civilization? - I don't really like the Kardashev scale, and it goes back to like, I don't like a lot of the\nnarratives about life, 'cause they're very like, you\nknow, survival of the fittest, energy consuming this,\nthat and the other thing. It's very like, I don't\nknow, sort of old world, you know, like conqueror mentality. - What's the alternative to that exactly? - I mean, I think it does require life to use new energy sources in\norder to expand the way it is. So that part's accurate. But I think this sort of process of life like being the mechanism that the universe\ncreatively expresses itself, generates novelty, explores the space of the possible, is really the thing that's\nmost deeply intrinsic to life. And so, you know, these sort of energy consuming scales of technology, I think is missing the\nsort of actual feature that's most prominent about any alien life that we might find, which is that it's literally our universe, our reality, trying to\ncreatively express itself, and trying to find out what can exist and trying to make it exist. - See but past a certain level\nof complexity, unfortunately, maybe you can correct\nme, but we're built... All complex life on Earth is built on a foundation of\nthat predator prey dynamic. - Yes.\n- And so like, I don't know if we can escape that. I don't know-\n- No, we can't. But this is why I'm okay with having a finite lifetime. And, you know, one of the reasons I'm okay with that, actually-\n- Yeah. - Goes back to this issue of the fact that we're resource bound. We live in a... You know, like we have a\nfinite amount of material, whatever way you wanna define material. I think like for me, you\nknow, material is time, material is information, but we have a finite amount of material. If time is a generating mechanism, it's always gonna be finite, because the universe is, you know, like it's a resource\nthat's getting generated, but it has a size. Which means that all the\nthings that could exist don't exist, and in fact, most of them never will. So death is a way to\nmake room in the universe for other things to exist that wouldn't be able to exist otherwise. So if the universe, over\nits entire temporal history, wants to maximize the number of things... Wants is a hard word, maximize is a hard word, all\nthese things are approximate, but wants to maximize the\nnumber of things that can exist, the best way to do it is to make recursively embedded\nstacked objects like us, that have a lot of structure\nand a small volume of space. And to have those things\nturn over rapidly, so you can create as\nmany of them as possible. - So there for sure is a bunch of those kinds of\nthings throughout the universe. - Hopefully. Hopefully our universe\nis teaming with life. - This is like early on in\nthe conversation you mentioned that we really don't understand much. Like there's mystery all around us. - Yes.\n- If you had to like bet money on it, like what percent? So like say a million years from now, the story of science\nand human understanding that started on Earth, is written. Like, what chapter are we on? Is this like 1%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 90%? How much do we understand? Like the big stuff? Not like the details of like... Like big important questions- - Yeah.\n- And ideas. - I think we're in our twenties and- - 20% of the 20?\n- No, like age-wise. Let's say we're in our twenties, but the lifespan is gonna\nkeep getting longer. - You can't do that.\n- I can. You know why I use that though? I'll tell you why. Why my brain went there, is because you know, anybody that gets an education in physics, you know, has this sort of trope about how all the great\nphysicists did their best work in their twenties, and then you don't do\nany good work after that. And I always thought it was kind of funny, because for me physics is not complete, it's not nearly complete, but most physicists\nthink that we understand most of the structure of reality. And so I think I... Actually, I think I put\nthis in the book somewhere, but like this idea to me that societies would discover\neverything while they're young is very consistent with the way we talk\nabout physics right now. But I don't think that's actually the way that things are gonna go, and you're finding that people that are making major discoveries are getting older in some\nsense than they were, and our lifespan is also increasing. So I think there is something about age and your ability to learn, and how much of the world you can see, that's really important\nover a human lifespan, but also over the lifespan of societies. And so I don't know how\nbig the frontier is, I don't actually think it has a limit. I don't believe in infinity\nas a physical thing, but I think as a receding horizon, I think because the\nuniverse is getting bigger, you can never know all of it. - Well, I think it's about 1.7%. - 1.7, where does that come from? - And it's a finite... I don't know, I just made it up. But it's like-\n- That number had to come from somewhere. - I think seven is the thing\nthat people usually pick - 7%?\n- So I wanted to say 1%, but I thought it would be funnier- - Yeah, I see.\n- To add a point, you know, so inject a\nlittle humor in there. So the seven is for the humor, one is for how much mystery\nI think there is out there. - 99% mystery, 1% known? - In terms of like really\nbig important questions. - Yeah.\n- It's like, the list... Say there's gonna be like 200 chapters, like the stuff that's gonna remain true. - But you think the\nbook has a finite size? - Yeah, yeah.\n- And I don't. I mean, not that I believe in infinities, but I think the size\nof the book is growing. - Well, the fact that the\nsize of the book is growing is one of the chapters in the book. - Oh, there you go. Oh, we're being recursive. (laughs) - I think you have to, you\ncan't have an ever growing book. - Yes, you can.\n- I mean you just... I mean, I don't even... Because then-\n- Well, you couldn't have been asking this at the origin of life, right? Because obviously, like you wouldn't have\nexisted at the origin of life. - Right.\n- But like the question of intelligence and artificial general... Like those questions did not exist then. And they in part existed because the universe invented\na space for those questions to exist through evolution. - But like, I think that\nquestion will still stand a thousand years from now. - It will, but there\nwill be other questions we can't anticipate now,\nthat we'll be asking. - Yeah, and maybe we'll\ndevelop the kinds of languages that'll be able to ask\nmuch better questions. - Right, or like the theory of\nlike gravitation for example. Like when we invented that theory, like we only knew about the planets in our solar system, right? And now, you know, many centuries later, we know about all these planets around other stars and black holes, and other things that we\ncould never have anticipated. And then we can ask questions about them. You know, like we\nwouldn't have been asking about singularities and like, can they really be physical\nthings in the universe several hundred years ago\nthat question couldn't exist. - Yeah, but it's not... I still think those are\nchapters in the book. Like I don't get a sense from that. - So do you think the universe has an end? If you think it's a book with an end? - I think the number of\nwords required to describe how the universe works has an end, yes. (Lex laughs) Meaning like, I don't care\nif it's infinite or not. - Right.\n- As long as the explanation is simple and it exists. - Oh, I see. - And I think there is\na finite explanation for each aspect of it. The consciousness, the life. - Yeah.\n- I mean very probably, there's like some... The black hole thing is\nlike, what's going on there? - Oh, I know.\n- Where's that going? Like what are they... What? And then you know, why the Big Bang? Like what-\n- Right. - It's probably, there's just\na huge number of universes and it's like, universes inside universes-\n- You think so? I think universes inside\nuniverses is maybe possible. - I just think it's... Every time we assume this is all there is, it turns out there's much more. - The universe is a huge place - And we mostly talked about the past and the richness of the past. But the future, I mean with\nmany worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, so- - Oh, I'm not a many worlds person. - You're not?\n- No. Are you? How many Lexes are there? - Depending on the day. Well-\n- Do some of them wear yellow jackets? - At the moment you asked the question, there was one. At the moment I'm answering it, there's now near infinity, apparently. I mean the future is\nbigger than the past, yes? - Yes.\n- Okay, well there you go. And the past, according to\nyou, it's already gigantic. - Yeah, but yeah, I mean that's consistent\nwith many worlds, right? 'Cause like there's this\nconstant branching, so. But it doesn't really have\na directionality to it. I don't know, many worlds is weird. So my interpretation of reality is like if you folded up like all that bifurcation of many worlds, and you just fold it into\nthe structure that is you, and you just said, you are\nall of those many worlds and like that sort of, you\nknow, like your history, like converged on you. But like you're actually... An object exists that's like... That you know, was selected to exist, and you're self-consistent\nwith the other structures. So like the quantum mechanical reality is not the one that you live in. It's this very deterministic,\nclassical world and you're carving a\npath through that space. But I don't think that\nyou're constantly branching into new spaces. I think you are that space. - Wait, so to you at, at the\nbottom it's deterministic. I thought you said the universe- - No, it's random at the bottom, right? But like this randomness that we see at the bottom of reality,\nthat is quantum mechanics, I think like people have\nassumed that is reality. And what I'm saying is like all those things you see in many worlds, all those versions of you, just collect them up and bundle them up, and like they're all you. And what has happened is, you know, like elementary particles don't have... They don't live in a\ndeterministic universe, the things that we study\nin quantum experiments, they live in this fuzzy random space. But as that structure collapsed and started to build structures\nthat were deterministic and evolved into you, you are a very deterministic,\nmacroscopic object. And you can look down on that universe that doesn't have time in\nit, that random structure. And you can see that all\nof these possibilities look possible, but they don't look... They're not possible for you, because you're constrained by this giant like causal structural history. So you can't live in all those universes. You'd have to go all the way back to the very beginning of the universe, and retrace everything\nagain to be a different you. - So where's the source of the free will for the macro object? - It's the fact that you're\ndeterministic structure living in a random background, and also, all of that\nselection bundled in you, allows you to select on possible futures. So that's where your will comes from, and there's just always a\nlittle bit of randomness because the universe is getting bigger and you know, like this idea that the past and the present\nis not large enough yet to contain the future. The extra structure has\nto come from somewhere. And some of that is because, outside of those giant causal structures that are things like us, it's fucking random out there, (both laugh) and it's scary, and we're all hanging onto each other, because the only way to\nhang onto each other, like the only way to exist, is to like clinging on to all of these causal structures that we happen to\nco-inhabitate existence with, and try to keep reinforcing\neach other's existence. - All the selection bundled in. - But free will's totally\nconsistent with that. - I don't know what I think about that. That's complicated to imagine. Just that little bit of\nrandomness is enough. Okay. - Well it's also... It's not just the randomness. There's two features. One is, the randomness helps generate some novelty and some flexibility. But it's also that like, because you're the structure\nthat's deep in time, you have this combinatorial\nhistory that's you, and I think about time\nand assembly theory, not as linear time, but as combinatorial time. So if you have all of the structure that you're built out of, you in principle, you know, your future can be\ncombinations of that structure. You obviously need to persist\nyourself as a coherent you, so you wanna optimize for a common, like a future in that combinatorial space that still includes you, most of the time for most of us. And when you make those kinds... And then that gives you\na space to operate in, and that's your sort of horizon where your free will can operate, and your free will can't be instantaneous. So for like example, like I'm sitting here\ntalking to you right now, I can't be in the UK and\nI can't be in Arizona, but I could plan, I could\nexecute my free will over time, because free will is a\ntemporal feature of life, to be there, you know,\ntomorrow or the next day if I wanted to. - But what about like the\ninstantaneous decisions you're making? Like to, I don't know... To put your hand on the table, that's- - I think those were\nalready decided a while ago. I don't think that the... I don't think free will\nis ever instantaneous, - But on a longer time horizon- - Yep.\n- There's some kind of steering going on?\n- Mm-hmm. And who's doing the steering? - You are.\n- Hmm. And you being this macro\nobject that encompasses- - Or you being Lex. (laughs) Whatever you wanna call it. (laughs) - There you are, assigning\nwords to things once again. - I know.\n- Why does anything exist at all? - Ugh, I don't know.\n- You've kind of taken that as a starting point. - Yeah.\n- That it exists. - I think that's the hardest question. - Isn't it just hard questions\nstacked on top of each other? - It is.\n- Wouldn't it be the same kind of question\nof, what is life? It is the same. Well that's sort of like, I try to fold all of the\nquestions into that question, 'cause I think that one's really hard, and I think the nature of\nexistence is really hard. - You think actually like\nanswering, what is life? Will help us understand existence? Maybe it's turtles all the way down and it'll just... Understanding the nature of turtles will help us kind of march down even if we don't have the\nexperimental methodology of reaching before the Big Bang. - Right. So, well I think there's\nsort of two questions embedded here. I think the one that we can't\nanswer by answering life is, why certain things exist and others don't. But I think the sort of ultimate question, the sort of like prime mover question of why anything exists, we will not be able to answer. - What's outside the universe? - Oh, there's nothing\noutside the universe. So I am a very, like... I am like the most physicalist\nthat like anyone could be. So like for me, everything\nexists in our universe and I like to like think it like, everything exists here. So even when we talk about\nthe multiverse, I don't... Like, to me it's not like\nthere's all these other universes outside of our universe that exists. The multiverse is a concept\nthat exists in human minds here, and it allows us to have\nsome counterfactual reasoning to reason about our own cosmology, and therefore it's causal in our biosphere to understanding the\nreality that we live in, and building better theories. But I don't think that the\nmultiverse is something like... And also math. Like I don't think\nthere's a platonic world that mathematical things live in. I think mathematical things\nare here on this planet. Like I don't think it makes\nsense to talk about things that exist outside of the universe. If you're talking about them, you're already talking\nabout something that exists inside the universe, and\nis part of the universe, and is part of like what\nthe universe is building. - It all originates here. It all exists here in some- - I mean, what else would there be? - There could be things you\ncan't possibly understand outside of all of this\nthat we call the universe. - And you can say that, and that's an interesting philosophy, but again, this is sort of\nlike pushing on the boundaries of like the way that we understand things. I think it's more constructive to say the fact that I can\ntalk about those things is telling me something about the structure of\nwhere I actually live and where I exist.\n- Just because it's more constructive\ndoesn't mean it's true. - Well, it may not be true. It may be something that allows\nme to build better theories I can test, to try to\nunderstand something objective. - And in the end, that's a\ngood way to get to the truth. - Exactly.\n- Even if you realize- - So I can't do experiments-\n- You were wrong in the past. - Yeah. So there's no such thing\nas experimental Platonism, but if you think math is an object that emerged in our biosphere, you can start experimenting\nwith that idea. And that to me is really interesting. Like to think about... Well people, I mean, mathematicians do think about math sometimes\nas an experimental science, but to think about math\nitself as a object for study by physicists, rather than a tool physicists\nused to describe reality, it becomes the part of reality\nthey're trying to describe, to me is a deeply interesting inversion. - What to you is most beautiful about this kind of exploration\nof the physics of life that you've been doing? - I love the way it makes me feel. - And then you have to try to convert the feelings into visuals and the visuals into words?\n- Yeah. So I think I love... Yeah, I love the way it\nmakes me feel to have ideas that I think are novel. And I think that the dual side of that is the painful process of\ntrying to communicate that with other human beings, to test if they have any\nkind of reality to them. And I also love that process. I love trying to figure out how to explain really\ndeep, abstract things that I don't think that we understand, and trying to understand\nthem with other people. And I also love the shock value of you... Like this kind of idea we\nwere talking about before, of like being on the boundary\nof like what we understand, and so people can kind of\nsee what you're seeing, but they haven't ever\nsaw it that way before. And I love the shock value\nthat like people have, like that immediate moment of recognizing that there's something beyond the way that they thought about things before. And being able to deliver that to people, I think is one of the biggest joys that I have, it's just like... And maybe it's that sense of mystery, like to share that there's something beyond the frontier of how we understand, and we might be able to see it. - And you get to see\nthe humans transformed- - Yeah.\n- Like a new idea? - Yes. And I think my greatest wish in life is to somehow contribute to an idea that transforms the way that we think. Like, you know, I have\nmy problem I wanna solve, but like the thing that\ngives me joy about it is really changing something, and ideally getting to\na deeper understanding of how the world works and what we are. - Yeah, I would say understanding\nlife at a deep level- - Yeah.\n- Is probably one of the most exciting problems. One of the most exciting questions. So I'm glad you are trying\nto answer just that, and doing it in style. (Sara laughs) - It's the only way to do anything. - Thank you so much for\nthis amazing conversation. Thank you for being you,\nSara. This was awesome. - Thanks, Lex. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sara Walker. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description.
